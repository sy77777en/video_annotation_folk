    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from a subject-level perspective, capturing a man in a black coat standing in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a subway car aisle. To his left and right, other passengers are seated in the middle ground, while the back of a figure in a red jacket occupies the left foreground. The camera then zooms in, transitioning to a close-up that centers on the man's face, with the surrounding passengers, now transformed into monsters, visible in the background. The shot continues to tighten, ending on an extreme close-up that fills the center of the frame with the man's eye.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a pale-skinned man with an angular face, dark spiky hair, and dark circles under his eyes, who stands in the aisle of a subway car. He is wearing a long black coat over a white t-shirt and dark pants. As he stands with his arms outstretched, the other passengers around him, who are initially depicted as ordinary people, transform into monstrous, non-human creatures. To his right, a seated, bald passenger becomes an insectoid creature holding a tablet, and other seated passengers reveal grotesque features, including multiple eyes and distorted faces. The camera zooms in on the main subject's serious face and then focuses on one of his large, dark eyes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a subway car, rendered in a stylized, hand-drawn animation with a muted color palette of grays, desaturated greens, and browns. The car's interior features a long central aisle with a dark, gridded floor, flanked by rows of simple, tan-colored bench seats. Rectangular fluorescent lights line the ceiling, while the windows show only darkness. Initially occupied by human passengers, the scene transforms to reveal that the seated figures are actually monstrous, alien-like creatures with varied, grotesque features. As this change occurs, a central figure wearing a black coat and a white shirt walks towards the camera inside the subway car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to an extreme close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively outlines the sequence of events and shot sizes, it could be more precise in its description of spatial dynamics and transitions. The initial mention of the \"figure in a red jacket\" in the left foreground is a strong start, but the caption fails to describe how this prominent element exits the frame as the camera moves forward, which is a key spatial change. The phrase \"transformed into monsters\" is an interpretation of the narrative; a more objective description would focus on their changed spatial presence, such as if they are now standing and looming in the shallow-focus background rather than remaining seated. Furthermore, the description of the camera movement as simply \"moves forward\" and the shot \"tighten[ing]\" is somewhat vague. It would be more descriptive to specify the type of movement, such as a \"dolly-in,\" and to clarify the final dynamic—for instance, explaining that a camera zoom occurs simultaneously as the man walks toward the lens, creating a rapid collapse of depth that culminates in the extreme close-up on his eye.",

As the camera performs a dolly-in, the figure in the red jacket exits the frame, marking a key spatial change.
