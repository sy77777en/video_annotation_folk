    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium full shot, featuring the main woman in black in the left foreground and a second woman in pink in the center-right foreground. The shot then transitions to a full shot, making the subjects appear smaller in the frame and revealing more of the green sports field, which occupies the foreground and middle ground. During this transition, both women shift from their initial positions slightly towards the left of the frame, remaining in the foreground. Throughout the shot, blue bleachers extend horizontally across the middle ground, with a building and trees visible in the top right background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a woman with dark skin, her dark hair styled in long braids tied back in a ponytail. She wears a black short-sleeved athletic shirt with a small white Swoosh logo on the right chest and black athletic shorts. Interacting closely with her is another woman with a lighter skin tone, whose dark hair is pulled back in a ponytail. This second woman wears a bright pink sleeveless athletic top over a black short-sleeved shirt, paired with black athletic shorts. Both women are engaged in what appears to be a dynamic soccer activity. In the midground, there are two additional women in pink athletic wear.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds on a sunlit outdoor sports field, likely for soccer or football, with a green grassy surface. The point of view is from a camera operator moving unsteadily across the field, adding a sense of dynamic motion and instability to the shot. In the background, blue bleachers of a stadium are visible, and beyond them, a multi-story building with windows and green trees can be seen against a bright sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the subjects, camera movement, and background elements, it could be improved by adding more specific detail about the subjects' spatial relationship and motion. The designation of the \"main woman\" seems speculative; unless one subject is clearly the focus, it's better to describe them neutrally. The initial description of their positions in the \"left foreground\" and \"center foreground\" is good, but it misses an opportunity to describe their depth relative to each other—for example, if the woman in black is positioned slightly closer to the camera than the woman in pink. Furthermore, the description of their movement as a \"shift... slightly towards the right\" is vague and may underrepresent the action. If they are walking, a more dynamic description like \"both women walk from the left towards the center of the frame\" would be more informative. Finally, the phrase \"making the subjects appear smaller in the frame\" is redundant since this is the natural effect of the camera moving backward into a full shot and could be removed for greater conciseness.",
