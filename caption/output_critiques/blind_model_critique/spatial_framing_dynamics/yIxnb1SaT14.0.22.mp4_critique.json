    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a city plaza at night, focusing on the architectural scenery rather than a specific subject. Initially, a tall, illuminated column is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. It is flanked by large buildings that fill the middle ground on the left, right, and across the background. An ornate street lamp is prominent in the left foreground, with other lamps scattered throughout the middle ground. The camera, positioned at a low angle, executes a slow and steady zoom-in toward the central column. This movement transitions the view into a wide shot, where the column now fills the frame vertically from the bottom to the top, and the buildings on the far left and right are partially cropped from view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a cityscape scenery shot of a grand, octagonal plaza at night, with the camera slowly zooming in. A very tall, ornate column, illuminated in a striking greenish-blue light and topped with a statue, stands as the central monument, surrounded by elegant, uniformly designed classical buildings whose windows glow with warm light. Ornate street lamps are scattered throughout the square, their bright lights creating a prominent starburst effect against the dark sky. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the majestic atmosphere and architectural grandeur of the entire environment, using the column as a centerpiece to showcase the scale and beauty of the location as a whole.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse shot captures the Place Vendôme in Paris at night, with the camera slowly zooming in on the central Vendôme Column. The tall, slender column, which features spiraling relief carvings, is illuminated by a greenish-blue light and topped with a statue. It stands on a large stone pedestal in the center of the square. Surrounding the square are grand, multi-story buildings of a uniform classical design, with illuminated windows and mansard roofs. Ornate, multi-lamp streetlights are positioned throughout the square, their bright lights creating a starburst effect against the dark night sky. A few indistinct people are visible on the ground level. A watermark in the bottom right corner reads \"MATHIEU STANIC CINEMATOGRAPHER.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the extreme wide shot and the main architectural elements, but its description of the camera movement is too simplistic and misses the resulting dynamic spatial changes. Stating the camera \"moves to the right and pans to the left\" is technically accurate, but it fails to describe the significant parallax effect this creates. A more effective description would note how the foreground street lamps glide swiftly across the frame from left to right, while the central column remains relatively stationary in the middle ground, creating a pronounced sense of depth. The caption also treats the composition as static, whereas the movement constantly reframes the scene; for example, the building on the right would grow in prominence while the one on the left recedes. The description could be improved by detailing the journey of a specific foreground element, such as a lamp entering on the bottom left and exiting on the bottom right, to better illustrate the camera's path and the three-dimensional feel of the space.",
