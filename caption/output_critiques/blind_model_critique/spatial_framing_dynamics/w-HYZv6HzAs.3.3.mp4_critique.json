    "pre_caption": "The video features a full shot of a man standing on a stage, positioned centrally in the frame. He is in the foreground, facing the audience, which is silhouetted and occupies the bottom of the frame. The large \"DxRyersonU\" sign is in the middle ground, stretching across the frame from left to right. Blue illuminated abstract shapes are visible behind the sign, adding depth to the background. To the right, a screen displaying \"TEDx\" is partially visible. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent view of the scene. The man gestures with his hands, but his position within the frame remains mostly unchanged.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned man stands on a stage in front of a large white sign that reads \"DxRyersonU\" with a red \"x\" and a part of \"D\". He is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved, button-up shirt and dark pants. He is facing an audience, which is mostly silhouetted and seated in rows in front of the stage. The man gestures with his hands as he speaks. Behind the \"DxRyersonU\" sign, there are blue illuminated abstract shapes. To the right of the stage, a screen displays \"TEDx\".**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is an indoor event, likely a presentation or talk, taking place on a stage. Dominating the background is a large sign with \"DxRyersonU\" in bold white letters, with the \"x\" and a part of “D”in red, set against a dark backdrop. Behind this sign, stylized, silhouetted building-like structures are illuminated with blue light. A man in a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt and dark trousers stands on the stage, which has a red carpet or rug. In the foreground, the silhouetted heads and shoulders of an audience are visible, facing the stage. To the far right, a portion of a projection screen shows \"TED\" branding.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the man's position is \"mostly unchanged\" and that the shot size is a consistent \"full shot.\" In the video, the man actually walks from his initial central position toward the right side of the stage, ending up closer to the \"TEDx\" screen. This movement is a key spatial dynamic that is completely missed. Consequently, the description of the background elements is static and inaccurate; as the man moves right, he transitions from being in front of the \"DxRyersonU\" sign to partially obscuring the \"TEDx\" screen, altering the composition. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention a slow camera push-in that occurs concurrently with the man's movement, which reframes the initial full shot into a medium shot, focusing more on his upper body and gestures by the end. The description of the audience as simply occupying the bottom of the frame is also insufficient, as the camera's slow push-in gradually crops them out of the shot, shifting the focus entirely to the middle and background planes.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a full shot of a man standing centrally on a stage, facing the audience, which is silhouetted at the bottom of the frame. As the video progresses, the man walks from the center toward the right side of the stage, moving closer to the \"TEDx\" screen and partially obscuring it. This movement shifts the composition, transitioning from the \"DxRyersonU\" sign in the middle ground to the \"TEDx\" screen. Concurrently, a slow camera push-in reframes the shot from a full shot to a medium shot, focusing more on the man's upper body and gestures. The audience, initially visible, is gradually cropped out, directing attention to the man and the background elements, including the blue illuminated abstract shapes.",
