    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of two license plates partially embedded in a pebbly beach. The plate labeled \"Jazz\" is positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground, while the \"COFFEE\" plate is on the right, also in the foreground. Both plates are at the same level as the camera, which is positioned at their height. The ocean forms the background, occupying the upper portion of the frame, with gentle waves continuously moving towards the shore. There are no significant changes in the spatial positioning of the plates or the camera throughout the video; the plates remain static, and the camera maintains a steady angle, capturing the consistent motion of the waves in the background. The pebbles surrounding the plates fill the lower part of the frame, creating a textured foreground. The overall composition remains constant, emphasizing the juxtaposition of the plates against the natural coastal backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two license plates partially embedded in a pebbly beach. The plate on the left is white with a blue border and displays the word \"Jazz\" in bold black letters, accompanied by a musical note symbol. The plate on the right is black with white lettering, displaying the word \"COFFEE.\" Both plates are partially embedded in the pebbles, with the ocean visible in the background. The scene suggests a playful juxtaposition of themes, combining music and coffee in a coastal setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor beach setting with a focus on two license plate-style signs partially buried in pebbly sand. The signs, one white with blue trim and the word \"Jazz,\" and the other black with the word \"Coffee,\" are positioned prominently in the midground. The background features a calm body of water, likely the ocean, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the area, highlighting the texture of the sand and the smooth surface of the water. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the signs adding a quirky, artistic element to the natural coastal environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good. It effectively follows the instructions by providing a detailed and accurate spatial analysis of the video.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is successful and where it could be slightly improved:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the elements (two plates, pebbles, ocean) and their spatial relationships is precise. It correctly identifies the 2D positions (left, right, upper, lower) and 3D depth (foreground, background) for each element.\n*   **Good:** The description of camera height (\"at their height\") and the dynamics of the scene (static plates, moving waves, steady camera) is accurate and clear.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The term **\"full shot\"** is slightly inaccurate in this context. A \"full shot\" typically frames a human subject from head to toe. For objects like license plates, a **\"medium shot\"** would be more appropriate, as it captures the subjects with a significant amount of their immediate environment visible (the pebbles and the ocean).\n\n### Completeness:\n*   **Excellent:** The caption covers all the required components from the instructions: shot size, 2D position, 3D depth, relative camera height, and the dynamics (or lack of change) over time. It analyzes all visible subjects and background elements thoroughly.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids speculation, emotional language, and ambiguity.\n*   **Excellent:** It successfully describes the constant nature of the framing, noting that the subjects are static and the camera is steady, which fulfills the requirement to describe any changes (or lack thereof).\n*   **Minor Point:** The final phrase, \"emphasizing the juxtaposition of the plates against the natural coastal backdrop,\" leans slightly towards interpretation rather than pure spatial description. A more neutral alternative would be: \"The overall composition remains constant, placing the man-made plates within a natural coastal backdrop.\"\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe caption is very strong and meets almost all the requirements of the prompt. It provides a clear, objective, and spatially detailed description. The only significant point of feedback is the choice of \"full shot,\" which could be more precise. The minor point on the final phrase is a subtle refinement.",
