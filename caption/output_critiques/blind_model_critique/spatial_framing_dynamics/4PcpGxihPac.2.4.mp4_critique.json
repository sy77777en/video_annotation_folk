    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is centrally framed, occupying the foreground. The camera is positioned at his eye level, capturing his head and shoulders against a dark, out-of-focus background. The framing remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with a full, dark beard and mustache is shown in a close-up. His face is covered in what appears to be red blood, with cuts and abrasions visible on his forehead and cheeks. His dark hair is unkempt. He stares forward with wide, dark eyes and an intense expression, his mouth slightly open. He wears a light-colored, worn-looking garment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, a close-up focuses on a man with a beard whose face is covered in red blood. The background is dark and out of focus, while a cool, blue-green light from above illuminates the subject, creating a grainy texture.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the close-up shot and the subject's foreground position, but it lacks precision regarding the spatial dynamics and composition. The statement that the man is \"centrally framed\" is an oversimplification; he is actually positioned slightly to the right of center, creating negative space on the left side of the frame. More importantly, the assertion that \"the framing remains static\" is misleading because it ignores the subject's movement. Throughout the video, the man subtly leans forward, moving closer to the camera, and then back, a key dynamic that changes his scale within the frame and his relationship with the foreground. The description of the background as simply \"dark\" and \"out-of-focus\" misses the opportunity to note a soft, circular light source visible in the upper left background, which adds a specific point of depth. Lastly, the camera is not at his eye level but is positioned slightly above, creating a subtle high-angle shot that the caption fails to mention.",
