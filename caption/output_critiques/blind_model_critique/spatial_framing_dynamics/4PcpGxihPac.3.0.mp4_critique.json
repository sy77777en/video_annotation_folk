    "pre_caption": "In a static medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He is viewed from outside the car, through the windshield which serves as a foreground element. A second, less distinct person sits to his left, occupying the left side of the frame, also in the middle ground. The man's hands are on a steering wheel located in the bottom-center of the frame. A thin string hangs from the top center, situated in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, maintaining a fixed perspective throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a middle-aged, fair-skinned man with a bald head, seen from the chest up through the windshield of a car. He is in the driver's seat, holding the steering wheel, and has a concerned expression with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth. He wears a light-colored, possibly light blue, collared shirt, and a gold chain is visible around his neck. To his right, in the passenger seat, the blurry silhouette of a second person with light-colored hair is faintly visible. The entire scene is saturated with a strong orange-red light, suggesting an external light source. A white string hangs down from the area of the rearview mirror.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is viewed from outside a car, looking through the front windshield into the cabin at night. A bald man sits in the driver's seat, his hands on the steering wheel. The entire view is saturated with an intense, warm, reddish-orange light that reflects off the glass, partially obscuring the interior. This light intensifies slightly, casting a deep red hue over the scene. A second person is faintly visible in the passenger seat, and a thin white string hangs down near the center of the windshield.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the shot size, primary subject, and camera movement, but it could be more precise in its spatial descriptions. The term \"less distinct person\" is vague; specifying that this person is out of focus due to a shallow depth of field would be more informative. The steering wheel's position at \"bottom right-center\" seems slightly inaccurate if the driver is at \"center-right\"; a position like \"bottom-center\" or \"bottom-right\" directly in front of him would be more logical. Furthermore, placing the \"thin string\" in the middle ground is likely incorrect; if it hangs from a rearview mirror, it would occupy a distinct plane between the foreground windshield and the middle-ground subjects. The description of the foreground windshield is a missed opportunity; mentioning details like moving reflections or water droplets would better establish its role as a separating layer. Lastly, while the forward camera movement is noted, describing its effect—such as the subtle parallax shift between the reflections on the windshield and the subjects behind it—would offer a more dynamic and complete analysis of the changing spatial relationships.",
