    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a man primarily on the left side of the screen, occupying the foreground. The background is entirely dark and indistinct. The camera maintains a position level with the subject. While the man is running, causing slight vertical motion, his position remains fixed on the left side of the frame, consistently facing left. His hands occasionally enter the frame in the bottom left foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up profile view of a Black man's head and shoulders against a dark background. He has short, dark hair and is wearing a shirt. The lighting is dim, illuminating only the left side of his face and head, leaving the right side mostly in shadow. His mouth is slightly open, and he is facing the left side of the frame, appearing to be running.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in an extremely dark environment where the surroundings are indistinguishable. It appears to be nighttime or within a space completely lacking light. A close-up shot prominently features a Black man in profile, who is running. At times, his hands briefly enter the frame. He is heavily shadowed and appears mostly as a silhouette against the pervasive darkness. No other details of the location are discernible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the dark background and level camera height, it could be more precise about the shot's composition and dynamics. The term \"close-up shot\" is ambiguous; given that the man's hands are visible, \"medium close-up\" would be more accurate, framing him from the chest or waist up. The description of him being in the \"center\" might be inaccurate; in profile shots of moving subjects, it is common to frame them slightly off-center (e.g., on the right side of the frame) to create leading room in the direction they are moving (the left). The most significant omission is the failure to describe the camera's own movement. To keep a running man \"fixed in the center,\" the camera must be tracking laterally alongside him. The caption only mentions the man's \"slight vertical motion\" from running but misses the crucial horizontal tracking motion of the camera, which is a key element of the shot's spatial dynamics. Clarifying that his horizontal position remains fixed while his vertical position oscillates would also improve accuracy.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This medium close-up shot frames a man primarily on the left side of the screen, occupying the foreground. The background is entirely dark and indistinct. The camera maintains a position level with the subject and tracks laterally alongside him, keeping his horizontal position fixed while he runs. His vertical motion causes slight oscillation, but he consistently faces left. His hands occasionally enter the frame in the bottom left foreground, indicating the shot frames him from the chest or waist up.",
