    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full-body shot of Tom, the cat, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground, reaching towards Jerry, the mouse, who is trapped under a goblet on the bed in the center. The bed and pillow occupy the middle ground, with the remote control near the center of the frame. The background features light green curtains. Tom's initial movement involves leaning forward, emphasizing his focus on Jerry. As Tom wraps Jerry in a cloth, the shot size changes to a close-up of Tom's hands in the center of the frame, highlighting the action. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout. In the final moment, Tom jumps off the bed, moving from the foreground to the bottom of the frame, indicating his exit from the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two animated characters: a large blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with white paws, a white face, and pink inner ears, and a small brown mouse with large ears and a tan belly. The cat, named Tom, is standing on a bed and is focused on the mouse, named Jerry, who is trapped inside an upside-down transparent goblet on the pillow beside a black remote control. Tom eagerly wraps Jerry in a white cloth with both hands. Holding the bundled package in his left hand, Tom jumps off the bed, highlighting the dynamic between the two characters.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a softly lit bedroom with beige and brown tones. A large bed with neatly arranged, white bedding and a brown headboard is positioned against the wall, with thick, light green curtains hanging in the background. A black remote control rests on the bed near the center. The scene features animated characters interacting with the bedding, causing visible movement and creasing in the fabric. The focus is on the bed and its immediate surroundings, with no overlays, text, or additional visual elements present.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows Tom chasing Jerry with dramatic changes in shot size. Tom first appears in a full-body shot as he jumps in from the side of the screen. He then puts Jerry in a bag. In the final moment, Tom attempts to jump down and exit the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and follows the instructions with a high degree of precision. It successfully translates the visual and spatial dynamics of the video into a clear, concise, and informative paragraph.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video content is as described, the caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (Tom, Jerry), key elements (goblet, bed, remote, curtains), and their specific spatial relationships and movements.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very thorough. It covers all the required components:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial \"full-body shot\" and the transition to a \"close-up.\"\n    *   **Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively uses 2D terms (left, center, bottom) and 3D terms (foreground, middle ground, background) for all major subjects and elements.\n    *   **Depth:** The use of foreground, middle ground, and background creates a clear sense of depth in the scene.\n    *   **Height:** It correctly states that the camera is at the \"subject's level.\"\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It expertly describes the changes, including Tom's initial lean, the shift in shot size to focus on his hands, and his final movement to exit the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It strictly avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and focuses only on what is visible.\n    *   It successfully describes the spatial framing and movement of the main subject (Tom) while also including the secondary subject (Jerry) and other scene elements.\n    *   The description of the transition from a full-body shot to a close-up is clear and well-explained.\n    *   Tom's exit is described in terms of his spatial movement (\"moving from the foreground to the bottom of the frame\"), which is exactly what the instructions requested.\n\n*   **Minor Point for Consideration:**\n    *   The caption uses slightly interpretive phrases like \"emphasizing his focus,\" \"highlighting the action,\" and \"indicating his exit.\" While these phrases add to the narrative flow and are not emotional or subjective, a stricter interpretation of the instructions might favor purely descriptive language (e.g., instead of \"highlighting the action,\" one could say, \"the close-up shows his hands wrapping the cloth\"). However, this is a very minor point, and the current phrasing significantly improves readability without violating the core spirit of the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is detailed, accurate, and perfectly structured to describe the spatial framing and dynamics of the scene. It is an excellent caption for the video.",
