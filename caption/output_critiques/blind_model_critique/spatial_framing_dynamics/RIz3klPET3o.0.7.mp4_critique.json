    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a character on a vehicle begins in the center of the frame, positioned on a short, diagonal black line in the middle ground. As the character moves from the center towards the right, the camera tracks its movement, revealing more short, disconnected black lines that form a descending, staggered path across the frame. The character travels from the center to the center-right, finally stopping on a long, horizontal line. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a side-on perspective, positioned at the subject's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A minimalist, black-and-white line drawing depicts a cartoonish figure riding a peculiar vehicle. The figure, composed of simple lines, wears a small, black-and-white hat. Three small, colored squares—blue, green, and red—trail behind the figure, with a small blue area at the back and a small red area at the front of its body. The vehicle resembles a sled-like runner, held by two ropes positioned at the front. The scene also contains several short, black lines, some horizontal and some diagonal, which appear to form a path or a series of platforms for the character.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera captures the scene in profile, a minimalist 2D environment is presented against a plain, light gray background. The setting consists of several short, disconnected black lines scattered across the space, acting as platforms for a small, stylized character on a vehicle to traverse. At the conclusion of the video, the number \"26\" becomes visible at the end of the final platform line.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the extreme wide shot and the camera's tracking motion, but it lacks crucial details about the scene's depth and composition. It fails to specify the 3D positioning of the elements; for instance, the character and the black lines could be described as being in the middle ground, set against a plain, light-colored background that fills the frame. While the caption mentions a \"side-on perspective,\" it omits the camera's height, which appears to be level with the action, not above or below it. Additionally, the description of the movement is too general; stating that the vehicle \"drops\" or \"falls\" from one line to the next would more precisely capture the dynamics of navigating the descending, staggered path. Finally, clarifying that the entire path, from the initial diagonal line to the final horizontal one, exists on a single flat plane would provide a more complete spatial analysis.",
