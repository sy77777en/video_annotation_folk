    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot from a high angle, looking down on an airport. In the bottom center foreground, a white airplane is positioned on a runway that extends vertically toward the top of the frame. A second, smaller airplane is visible in the top center background, flying on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Taxiways intersect the runway in the lower half of the frame. The camera and all subjects remain stationary throughout the shot, while a text overlay at the bottom of the screen changes its message.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This animated video shows two white passenger jets at an airport under hazy, reddish-brown skies. In the foreground, one jet with swept-back wings is seen from a high angle from behind, positioned in the center of a runway. In the background, a second, similar jet appears smaller as it flies on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Text at the bottom of the screen displays a radio transmission from \"FDX1432\" in orange letters, initially issuing the command \"Southwest, abort!\" followed by the message \"Fedex is on the go.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides an aerial view of an airport runway under hazy, reddish-brown skies, suggesting either dawn, dusk, or poor visibility. In the foreground, a white airplane is positioned on a long, dark gray runway marked with white lines and dark tire scuffs. Yellow-lined taxiways intersect the runway, surrounded by flat, brown, grassy terrain. In the distance, another white airplane is visible in the air, aligned with the same runway, with the faint silhouette of an urban area on the horizon. An overlay in a black box at the bottom of the screen displays text with \"FDX1432:\" in orange, followed by \"Southwest, abort!\" and \"Fedex is on the go\" in white, in typewriter-style font.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement seems contradictory to the action. If the airplane is accelerating toward the top of the frame for takeoff, the camera would logically tilt upward to follow its ascent, not downward. The combination of a downward tilt and a backward camera move would cause the subject to quickly exit the top of the frame. The term \"middle ground\" is also slightly ambiguous for a direct high-angle shot; describing the plane's position simply as being in the \"bottom center of the frame\" might be more precise. Furthermore, while the second airplane is noted, the caption could be improved by specifying its movement, such as \"slowly descending,\" to better convey the scene's dynamics. Finally, the camera's \"instability\" and \"arcing motion\" are good details, but the primary tracking movement needs to be logically consistent with the subject's trajectory.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an extreme wide shot from a high angle, looking down on an airport. In the bottom center of the frame, a white airplane is positioned on a runway that extends vertically toward the top of the frame, preparing for takeoff. As the airplane accelerates, the camera tilts upward to follow its ascent. A second, smaller airplane is visible in the top center background, slowly descending on an approach path aligned with the same runway. Taxiways intersect the runway in the lower half of the frame. The camera remains stable, with a smooth arcing motion that tracks the primary airplane's trajectory, while a text overlay at the bottom of the screen changes its message.",
