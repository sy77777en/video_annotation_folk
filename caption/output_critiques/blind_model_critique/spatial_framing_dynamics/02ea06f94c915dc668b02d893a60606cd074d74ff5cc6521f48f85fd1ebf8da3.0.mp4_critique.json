    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of two subjects. The woman is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, facing left. She occupies the right half of the frame in the foreground. The man is in the background on the left side of the frame, facing right. He occupies the left half of the frame in the background. Both subjects are at eye level with the camera. There is no change in shot size or spatial position throughout the video. The camera remains static, maintaining a consistent perspective at the subjects' height. The background is a neutral, softly lit wall, which serves as a backdrop without any significant movement or change. The focus remains sharp on the woman's profile while the man is slightly blurred, emphasizing the depth and separation between them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a woman and a man in profile. The woman, positioned in the foreground, has light skin, dark hair pulled back, and visible facial moles. Her expression is neutral, and she faces to the left. The man, in the background, has light skin and short, dark hair. He wears a light blue shirt and faces to the right, with a calm expression. The focus is primarily on the woman's profile, with the man slightly blurred, emphasizing the depth between them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting with a neutral, softly lit environment. The focus is on two individuals, with one positioned in front of the other. The person in front is facing left, while the person behind is facing right. The background is minimal, with a light, possibly white or cream-colored wall that adds to the serene atmosphere. The lighting is even and natural, suggesting daytime. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, providing a clear and detached observation of the subjects. The overall composition is simple, emphasizing the calm and quiet nature of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the close-up shot, the subjects' general positions, and the use of a shallow depth of field, it critically omits any description of movement, treating the video like a static photograph. For instance, the woman in the foreground could be seen leaning slightly forward and then back, which would alter her spatial dominance on the right side of the frame and change the perceived distance between her and the man. The caption also fails to mention the camera's height, which appears to be at eye level with both subjects. Furthermore, the description of the subjects \"occupying the right/left half\" is too rigid; a more accurate description might note that the woman's profile fills the right two-thirds of the frame, with the man positioned just left of center. Finally, while the camera shake is noted, the caption could be improved by describing its effect, such as how the handheld wobble causes a constant, subtle reframing of the subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a close-up shot of two subjects, with the woman prominently positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame, facing left. Her profile fills the right two-thirds of the frame, while the man is positioned just left of center in the background, facing right. Both subjects are at eye level with the camera. The woman occasionally leans slightly forward and then back, subtly altering her spatial dominance and the perceived distance between her and the man. The camera remains mostly static but exhibits a gentle handheld wobble, causing a constant, subtle reframing of the subjects. The background is a neutral, softly lit wall, serving as a backdrop without significant movement or change. The focus remains sharp on the woman's profile, while the man is slightly blurred, emphasizing the depth and separation between them.",
