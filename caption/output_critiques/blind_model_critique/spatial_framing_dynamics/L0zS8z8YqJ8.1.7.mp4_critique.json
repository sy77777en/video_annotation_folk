    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a central, wood-paneled compartment is positioned in the middle ground, framed by a dark gray structure in the foreground. Within this central compartment, two chrome figures are seated on a bench to the left, and two more are on a facing bench to the right. To the left and right of this main view, smaller cutouts show partial views of similar interiors. The camera, initially at the subjects' level, pulls back and moves downward as a black horizontal line rises from the bottom of the screen. This reveals a second, more crowded compartment in the lower half of the frame, which becomes the new central focus. In this final wide shot, the camera is positioned above the subjects, looking down into the lower compartment where six chrome figures are seated, three on each facing bench. The original compartment remains visible in the top half of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A 3D animation displays a cross-section of a wood-paneled compartment populated by stylized, chrome-colored humanoid figures. These figures are featureless and have a smooth, metallic surface. Initially, four of these figures are shown sitting on two facing benches, two figures per bench. On the back wall between them, a light gray suit jacket and a darker gray overcoat hang from hooks. The scene then transitions to show a different configuration within the same type of compartment. In this second arrangement, there are six of the chrome figures, three on each side, sitting on the facing benches. The hanging coats are no longer present in this more crowded layout.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A 3D rendering displays a cross-section of a vehicle's interior, framed within a larger, dark gray structure. The main compartment, seen through a central rectangular cutout, is lined with light wood paneling and has a door at the far end, flanked by two hanging gray jackets. On either side, light brown upholstered benches face each other, occupied by several silver, humanoid figures. The dark gray framing structure also features smaller, rounded-corner cutouts to the left and right, offering partial views of similar interiors. As the view pulls back and moves downward, a black horizontal line separates the upper section from a lower one, revealing another, more crowded compartment with more silver figures seated inside.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a wide shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and above the subject when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its use of spatial and cinematic terms. \"Wide shot,\" \"central,\" \"middle ground,\" \"foreground,\" \"left,\" \"right,\" \"lower half,\" and \"top half\" are all used correctly to build a clear and precise mental image of the scene's composition.\n*   The description of the subjects (chrome figures) and their placement on the benches is specific and factual.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption correctly identifies the initial and final shot as a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Position, Depth, and Height:** It successfully describes the 2D and 3D positions of all key elements (compartments, framing structure, figures) and explicitly states the camera's height relative to the subjects (\"at the subjects' level,\" \"positioned above the subjects\").\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The description of the movement is a key strength. It clearly explains the camera's \"pull back and move downward\" motion and the simultaneous reveal caused by the \"black horizontal line\" rising. It effectively captures the transition from a single-focus scene to a dual-level composition.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption packs a significant amount of detail into a single, coherent paragraph without any wasted words.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. The word \"crowded\" is used in a comparative, factual sense (six figures vs. four) rather than an emotional one, which is acceptable.\n*   **No Speculation:** The description is grounded entirely in what is visible, with no speculative phrases like \"it seems\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of what the instructions asked for. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows all stylistic and content guidelines. It masterfully describes both the static composition and the dynamic transition of the scene's spatial framing.",
