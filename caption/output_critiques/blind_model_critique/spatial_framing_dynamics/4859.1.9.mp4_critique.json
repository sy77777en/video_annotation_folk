    "pre_caption": "The video opens with an extreme close-up, bird's-eye view of items inside a shopping cart, which occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to a full, eye-level shot of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The red and blue shopping cart remains in the foreground, framing the bottom and sides of the final shot. In the background, a wall with murals is visible on the left, while trees are positioned on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a blurry close-up of some tomatoes before tilting up to a clearer, wide shot of a man with a light skin tone and a short beard who is dressed as an elderly woman. He is wearing a pastel-colored, diamond-patterned cardigan in shades of pink, yellow, and blue, along with matching light-colored plaid pants. He also wears a light-colored headscarf tied under his chin, with a grey wig visible beneath it, and a pair of glasses. He stands behind the red and blue shopping cart, holding its white handlebar with his left hand while using a cane with his right hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a bird's-eye view from within a red and blue shopping cart, transitioning to an eye-level perspective as the cart is pushed forward. The scene unfolds on a paved concrete area under a large architectural overhang during the daytime, with bright sunlight casting distinct shadows across the ground. In the background, a light-colored wall is adorned with graphic murals, and green trees are visible beyond the covered space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned above the subject when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively describes the camera's tilt and the general composition, some details could be refined for greater accuracy. The initial \"extreme close-up\" might be an overstatement; if several distinct items like a carton of juice and a bag of apples are visible together, \"close-up\" would be more appropriate. Similarly, \"bird's-eye view\" implies a perfect 90-degree overhead angle, whereas the shot might be a less severe \"high-angle shot\" looking down into the cart. The most significant potential inaccuracy is the description of the final shot as a \"full shot\" while also stating the cart frames the bottom. A full shot typically includes the subject's entire body from head to toe. If the shopping cart in the foreground obscures the man's feet and lower legs, the shot would more accurately be described as a \"medium full shot\" (or cowboy shot). Lastly, while the cart frames the bottom, stating it also frames the \"sides\" might be an exaggeration unless the cart's handle or structure significantly wraps around the lateral edges of the frame; it likely just occupies the bottom portion.",
