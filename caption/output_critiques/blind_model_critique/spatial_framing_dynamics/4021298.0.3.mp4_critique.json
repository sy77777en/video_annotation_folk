    "pre_caption": "In an initial full shot filmed at the subjects' level, a standing white camel occupies the left foreground, positioned in front of a stone wall in the middle ground. To its right, a dark brown camel stands in the middle ground, with a large rock formation in the background. The camera then pans to the right while tilting downward, causing the standing white camel to move out of the left side of the frame. This movement reveals a sitting white camel in the bottom left foreground and another sitting camel in the bottom right foreground. In the final composition, the dark brown camel is now in the center-left middle ground, and the rear of another camel is visible in the right middle ground, with the camera positioned above the sitting camels.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of saddled dromedary camels are gathered in a sandy area next to a stone wall. On the left, a white camel stands, wearing a bridle and a colorful saddle adorned with a red, white, and orange striped blanket and multicolored tassels. In the center, another white camel is sitting on the ground. It has a black, spiky decoration on its forehead and is also equipped with a saddle, which is partially covered by a red blanket. Behind the standing white camel, a dark brown camel is standing. To the right of the sitting camel, another sitting light brown camel is visible, and behind this camel, the rear of another camel is visible. The camera gradually pans from left to right, causing the camels to move in and out of the frame, although their relative positions to each other remain unchanged, and they are mostly stationary.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunny, outdoor setting at the base of a large, craggy rock formation, several camels are gathered near a rough stone wall. The ground is sandy and uneven. A white camel stands in the left foreground, outfitted with a decorative, striped saddle adorned with colorful tassels and a blue halter, but goes out of frame later as the camera moves. Nearby, other camels are sitting or standing, including another white one that is lying on the ground, all equipped with saddles and harnesses. The bright sunlight casts strong shadows across the scene as the view pans to show the group of animals.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively outlines the camera movement and the transition between subjects, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships in the final frame. For instance, the description of the dark brown camel's legs being in the \"top left corner\" seems unlikely given the camera pans right and tilts down; they would more plausibly be near the top center or have exited the frame entirely. The caption also fails to describe the final position of the stone wall, which was a prominent element in the initial shot; it likely remains visible in the middle ground behind the newly revealed sitting camels. Furthermore, the description of \"another sitting camel\" and \"the rear of another camel\" is vague; adding a simple color descriptor (e.g., \"a light brown sitting camel\") would provide more clarity without adding significant length. Finally, the term \"reveals\" is slightly passive; a more dynamic description, such as \"the downward tilt brings a sitting white camel into the left foreground,\" would better capture the effect of the camera's movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a full shot at the subjects' level, featuring a standing white camel in the left foreground in front of a stone wall in the middle ground. To its right, a dark brown camel stands in the middle ground, with a large rock formation in the background. As the camera pans to the right and tilts downward, the standing white camel exits the left side of the frame. This movement brings a sitting white camel into the bottom left foreground and reveals a light brown sitting camel in the bottom right foreground. In the final composition, the dark brown camel is positioned near the top center of the frame, while the rear of a light brown camel is visible in the right middle ground. The stone wall remains visible in the middle ground behind the newly revealed sitting camels, with the camera positioned above them.",
