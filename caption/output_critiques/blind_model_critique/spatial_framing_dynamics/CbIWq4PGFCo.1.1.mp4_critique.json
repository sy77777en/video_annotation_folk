    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a young man in the foreground. He is positioned in the middle of the frame, looking down and slightly to his left. Behind him, a blurry, barren landscape of light-brown earth occupies the background. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, fair-skinned man with short, wavy, dark brown hair is shown in a close-up. His hair appears slightly damp, and his face is smudged with dirt, with some light stubble on his chin and upper lip. He is wearing a dark, dirty t-shirt. He looks down and slightly to his left with a somber, contemplative expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a barren, outdoor landscape under the warm, soft light of either sunrise or sunset. The ground consists of uneven, light-brown sand or dry earth. In the background, a blurry, sloping hill of similar arid terrain is visible. A young man wearing a dark, dirt-stained t-shirt is positioned in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shot size as a close-up and notes the subject's central position, it includes the subjective and speculative phrase \"who appears to be pensive,\" which should be avoided. The description of the camera movement as a \"counterclockwise arc\" is a good start, but it lacks detail on the dynamic impact of this motion on the subject's framing. For example, it doesn't specify the starting and ending points of the arc (e.g., moving from a three-quarter view of his right side to his left) or clarify if he remains perfectly centered throughout the orbit. Furthermore, the caption omits the camera's height relative to the subject, a crucial element of spatial framing; based on the described shot, the camera is likely positioned at the man's eye level. Finally, while his initial pose is described, it is not confirmed whether he holds this position for the duration of the camera's movement, which is an important detail for understanding the scene's dynamics.",
