    "pre_caption": "In this wide shot, a herd of buffalo is positioned across the center of the frame in the middle ground. Tall grass occupies the foreground across the bottom of the frame. Trees and hills form the background, visible across the top portion of the frame. The shot remains static, with no changes in framing or significant subject movement. The camera is positioned at the height of the buffalo.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of buffalo standing in tall grass. The buffalo are dark in color, with prominent curved horns and sturdy builds. They are closely gathered, facing forward, in a natural environment with trees visible in the background, suggesting a savanna or grassland habitat. The buffalo are the primary subjects, collectively forming a cohesive group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a grassy savanna, surrounded by lush green trees. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as indicated by the clear visibility and natural light. A group of buffalo is prominently featured, standing amidst tall, dry grass that sways gently, suggesting a light breeze. The buffalo are dark in color, contrasting with the pale grass and vibrant greenery of the trees. The scene is calm and natural, with no visible human presence or structures, emphasizing the untouched wilderness.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main elements and their general placement, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. The description of the buffalo as a single entity in the \"lower one-fourth\" is too general; a more accurate description might note that the herd is spread horizontally across the lower third of the frame, with some individuals clustered in the center-left and others scattered toward the right. The statement \"no significant subject movement\" is likely an oversimplification; even in a static shot, there is probably subtle internal movement, such as some buffalo grazing with their heads down while others stand alert, and perhaps one or two individuals slowly walking a few steps within the group, which would be a key dynamic to capture. Furthermore, positioning the camera \"at the height of the buffalo\" seems inconsistent with a wide shot where they occupy the lower portion of the frame; it is more likely the camera is positioned at a slightly elevated height, looking across the landscape, which better explains the visible separation between the foreground grass and the middle-ground herd.",
