    "pre_caption": "This is a static, wide scenery shot of an attic bedroom, captured from a low camera height with a wide-angle lens, creating a broad and slightly distorted perspective. The sloped ceiling with a dark wooden beam occupies the top left of the frame, leading the eye toward a central skylight in the upper background. In the left background, a bed is partially visible. A wall of white closets is positioned in the center background. In the right middle ground, a wooden desk sits against the wall, with a chair placed in front of it. The scene is framed on the far right by a dark door in the foreground, which enhances the sense of depth, extending from the shadowed foreground to the more distant, illuminated elements of the room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit attic bedroom, characterized by its rustic and cozy atmosphere. The video lacks a main subject, as the static, wide-angle view is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural character of the space. The room features a sloped white ceiling with exposed dark wooden beams and a large, central skylight that provides the main source of natural light, revealing a glimpse of green foliage outside. To the left, a bed with a black metal frame is softly illuminated by a warm bedside lamp. In the background, a wall of simple white closet doors stands opposite a small wooden desk and chair in the right midground, creating a sense of a quiet, lived-in space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide shot captures an attic bedroom with a sloped, white ceiling supported by exposed wooden beams. In the center of the ceiling, a large skylight reveals a glimpse of green foliage against a bright sky. The room has light beige-colored carpeting and white walls. On the left, a bed with a black metal headboard and a small nightstand are slightly blurred. Against the back wall stand tall, white closet doors with simple wooden knobs. To the right, a small wooden desk and a matching chair with a green and yellow patterned cushion are positioned against the wall, next to a white radiator. The room is dimly lit, with a warm glow emanating from the left side, while the right side, including a dark wooden door, remains in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is excellent and serves as a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all stylistic and content requirements.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description is highly accurate in its spatial analysis. It correctly identifies the shot as a static wide shot and precisely maps out the key elements of the room. The observation about the wide-angle lens creating a \"broad and slightly distorted perspective\" is a sharp and accurate detail that directly impacts the spatial framing. Furthermore, the analysis of how the foreground door \"enhances the sense of depth\" is an excellent example of describing spatial dynamics, not just listing object positions.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully incorporates all the required components from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Clearly stated as a \"wide scenery shot.\"\n*   **Position:** It provides both the 2D position (e.g., \"top left,\" \"center,\" \"far right\") and the 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for multiple elements, including the ceiling, skylight, bed, closets, desk, and door.\n*   **Depth:** Depth is not only mentioned but explained by describing how the foreground and background elements interact to create it.\n*   **Camera Height:** Correctly identified as \"low camera height.\"\n*   **Changes:** The static nature of the shot is clearly noted, correctly addressing the instruction to describe any changes (or lack thereof).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect understanding of and adherence to the instructions.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"cozy\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Focus:** The entire description is focused squarely on \"spatial framing and dynamics,\" as requested. It avoids describing non-visible elements or making assumptions, instead detailing the composition and relationships of what is present in the frame. The description of the sloped ceiling \"leading the eye\" is an effective way to describe compositional lines without becoming overly subjective.",
