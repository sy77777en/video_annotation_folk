    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man positioned slightly to the right of the center in the frame, occupying the foreground. He is engaged in conversation, with visible hand gestures that emphasize his points. The camera is at the subject's eye level, maintaining a consistent perspective throughout the scene. In the background, another person is partially visible, positioned slightly to the left, adding depth to the composition. This person is in the middle ground, with their features less distinct. The setting includes warm lighting and a striped fabric pattern, contributing to the cozy atmosphere. The camera remains steady, focusing on the man's expressions and gestures, while subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium skin tone and a short, neatly trimmed beard. He is wearing a light-colored shirt with a dark pattern and has short hair. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation, as his facial expressions change from a slight grimace to a more focused look. He gestures with his hand, emphasizing his points. In the background, another person is partially visible, wearing a colorful, striped shirt, but their features are not clear. The setting suggests an indoor environment, possibly a restaurant or café.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an indoor setting, likely a cozy, dimly lit restaurant or bar, with an over-the-shoulder POV showing a character's upper body and the scene ahead. The environment features warm lighting, with a mix of red and green hues creating a relaxed atmosphere. The background includes a striped fabric pattern, possibly on a booth or seat, adding a touch of color and texture. The character is engaged in conversation, with visible gestures. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom, displaying dialogue in yellow text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the main subject's framing (medium close-up, right of center, foreground) and the camera's position (eye level, steady).\n*   However, it contains a significant contradiction. It first places the second person \"in the background\" and then in the next sentence states, \"This person is in the middle ground.\" This is a direct error that makes the spatial description confusing and inaccurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the required elements: shot size, 2D position (left/right/center), 3D depth (foreground/background/middle ground), camera height, and movement (or lack thereof).\n*   It effectively describes two subjects, correctly identifying the main subject and the secondary, partially visible one.\n*   It also includes other visible elements like subtitles and background patterns, describing their position as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violations:** The caption fails to adhere to the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The phrase \"contributing to the cozy atmosphere\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood. Similarly, \"warm lighting\" is a subjective quality; a more neutral description would be \"yellow-toned lighting.\" The phrase \"emphasize his points\" is an interpretation of the subject's intent rather than a neutral description of the action.\n*   **Strengths:** The caption correctly follows the instructions to be a single, concise paragraph in simple English. It successfully identifies and describes the spatial framing and dynamics for the key subjects and elements as requested. It avoids speculative language and correctly notes the static nature of the camera.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but has notable flaws. Its primary weaknesses are the factual contradiction regarding the second person's depth and the inclusion of subjective, emotional language, which directly violates the instructions. To be considered a good caption, it would need to resolve the contradiction and remove all subjective interpretations.",
