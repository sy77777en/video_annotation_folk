    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, capturing a man in the middle ground on the left side of the frame, seated at a desk. The desk, along with its electronic equipment, occupies the center and right portions of the frame, stretching from the middle ground into the foreground. A computer monitor is visible in the top right background. The shot then transitions, moving in to become a close-up that centers on the man's hands in the foreground as they manipulate a small, brightly glowing object. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. He is seated at a desk with electronic equipment, including a few keyboards and a mouse. The scene has a dark green color filter, suggesting a night vision effect. The video is blurry and low resolution. The man is engaged in manipulating the equipment, with a focus on his hands interacting with a glowing object, possibly a small device or control. His posture is slightly leaned forward, indicating concentration on the task at hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an indoor setting with a dimly lit, night-vision effect, highlighting a person seated at a desk surrounded by multiple keyboards and electronic equipment with illuminated buttons and screens. The person interacts with the devices and holds a glowing object, with the green hue providing the primary visibility.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption correctly uses and applies all the requested spatial terminology. It accurately identifies shot sizes (\"medium shot,\" \"close-up\"), 2D positions (\"left side,\" \"center and right,\" \"top right\"), 3D depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\"), and camera height (\"at the subject's level\").\n\n*   **Completeness:** It is comprehensive, covering all the required elements from the instructions. It describes the initial framing, the spatial relationship between multiple elements (man, desk, monitor), the dynamic change in the shot (\"moving in to become a close-up\"), and the final framing. It successfully describes both the static composition and the spatial dynamics.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Structure:** The caption follows the specified structure perfectly, starting with the shot size, describing the spatial positions of subjects and elements, detailing the transition, and noting the camera's height.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and clear. It provides a rich spatial description without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language, sticking to observable spatial facts as instructed. The phrase \"brightly glowing\" is an objective description of a visual property, not a subjective opinion.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It effectively translates a visual scene into a precise and informative spatial description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium shot featuring a man seated at a desk on the left side of the frame, with the desk and its electronic equipment extending from the center to the right, spanning the middle ground to the foreground. A computer monitor is visible in the top right background. The shot transitions into a close-up, focusing on the man's hands in the foreground as they handle a small, brightly glowing object. The camera maintains its position at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
