    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene landscape during sunset. The camera remains stationary throughout, capturing the expansive scenery. A prominent tree occupies the left side of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Its branches extend across the upper portion of the scene, partially silhouetted against the glowing sky. In the middle ground, a grassy field stretches horizontally, leading towards the horizon. A few scattered trees are visible in the background, positioned towards the right side of the frame. The sun is near the horizon, located slightly off-center to the right, casting warm light across the scene. The camera's height is level with the tree, providing a clear view of the landscape. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning of elements within the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, capturing the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene. The emphasis is on the overall mood created by the sunset, trees, and open field, rather than any specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene during sunset, featuring a serene landscape with a prominent tree in the foreground. The setting is a grassy field with a few scattered trees in the distance. The sky is painted with warm hues as the sun sets on the horizon, casting a gentle glow over the scene. The environment is calm, with no visible movement, emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the sun's rays filtering through the tree branches, creating a picturesque view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption contains a significant contradiction by stating there are \"no noticeable changes in... spatial positioning\" after correctly describing the foreground tree trunk moving across and exiting the frame. This camera pan would also cause other elements to shift; for example, the sun, which you place on the left, would also move toward the right of the frame as the pan progresses, a key dynamic that is omitted. The description also misses the opportunity to detail the visual effect of this movement, such as how the pan gradually reveals a winding river in the middle ground that was initially hidden behind the foreground tree. Furthermore, the description of the sky is incomplete; it fails to mention the dramatic, slow-moving clouds in the upper frame that drift from right to left, creating a compelling sense of contrary motion against the landscape. Lastly, the camera height description \"level with the tree\" is vague; a more accurate description would be that the camera is positioned at a low angle, looking slightly up at the tree trunk, which exaggerates its scale against the setting sun in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot of a serene landscape during sunset, featuring a prominent tree on the left side of the frame. The camera begins to pan slowly, causing the tree trunk to move across and eventually exit the frame, revealing a winding river in the middle ground that was initially hidden. As the camera pans, the sun, initially positioned slightly off-center to the right, shifts further right, casting warm light across the scene.
