    "pre_caption": "The video shows a wide shot of the scenery, maintaining a static frame focused on a red brick building's exterior. A black wrought iron fence with finials is prominent in the foreground, spanning the lower portion of the frame. In the middle ground, to the left, a green bush with red flowers is situated beside an arched wooden door, which is positioned slightly left of the center. A light-colored wall pillar is located in the bottom right, transitioning from the foreground to the middle ground. The red brick building itself occupies the background, featuring a black lantern-style light fixture mounted above the door in the center-left. To the right of the door, a tall, narrow arched window is visible, and a portion of another window with dark shutters can be seen in the top right. The camera is positioned at roughly the height of the fence, angled slightly upwards towards the building.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This architectural scenery shot highlights the exterior details of a red brick building, featuring an arched wooden door, a black wrought iron fence with fleur-de-lis finials, a green bush with red flowers, and a light-colored wall pillar in the lower right corner. The focus is on the texture, design elements, and the interplay of the built environment with the small patch of nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene focused on the entrance of a red brick building. In the foreground, a black metal fence with decorative finials and a white or light-colored stucco wall with a brick-capped top are visible. Behind the fence, a green bush with red flowers stands to the left of an arched wooden door, which has a small, dark window. Above the door, a black lantern-style light fixture is mounted on the brick wall. To the right of the entrance, a tall, narrow arched window is visible. Further right, another window with dark shutters is partially visible on the upper right of the building. The scene is captured during the day.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Your description accurately identifies the key architectural elements and their general placement, but it could be more precise about the shot's framing and the dynamics of the camera movement. While you label it a \"wide shot,\" the detailed focus on the door, windows, and fixtures suggests it's more of a medium-wide shot, as a true wide shot might include more of the surrounding street or sky. The description of the \"light-colored wall pillar\" is slightly confusing; in the video, this element appears to be a larger stone post anchoring the fence in the foreground, rather than an element that \"transitions\" between planes. Most importantly, while you note the camera is \"shaky and unsteady,\" you miss the opportunity to describe the *effect* of this movement on the composition. For instance, the shakiness causes the finials on the right side of the fence to intermittently clip out of the frame, and the top edge of the building's roofline bobs in and out of view at the top, making the framing feel unstable and constantly shifting rather than just statically composed. Clarifying these dynamic aspects would provide a more complete picture of the spatial experience.",
