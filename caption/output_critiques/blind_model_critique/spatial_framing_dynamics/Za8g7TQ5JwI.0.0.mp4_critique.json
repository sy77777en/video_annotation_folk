    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of the side of a black vehicle, with its front fender and wheel positioned on the left side of the frame and the door in the center. As the vehicle moves forward, the camera pulls back, transitioning to a medium shot that captures the vehicle's full side profile in the center of the frame. The vehicle is shown moving from the right side of the frame toward the left. The dusty ground occupies the foreground at the bottom, with sparse green foliage visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the vehicle's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black, modified off-road vehicle is shown from a side profile as it moves. The vehicle, a Mahindra Thar, features a hardtop, prominent external door hinges, and custom metal tube side steps. Its large, knobby tires are mounted on black rims that have a thin red accent line.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit, outdoor setting, a black off-road vehicle with a hardtop is parked on a dusty, unpaved path. The vehicle is equipped with large, knobby tires on black rims. Sparse green foliage is visible against a clear sky in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the core camera movement from a close-up to a medium shot, but its spatial descriptions could be more precise and less ambiguous. The initial description of the door being in the \"upper right\" of a close-up focused on the front fender seems unlikely; the door would more plausibly occupy the center-right of the frame. The most significant point of confusion is the phrase stating the vehicle \"initially appears in the middle of the scene and eventually is positioned in the center and upper right side of the frame.\" This conflates the 3D depth (\"middle of the scene,\" which should be \"middle ground\") with the 2D frame position. The vehicle remains in the middle ground throughout; it is its position *within the frame* that changes. The final position \"in the center and upper right\" is also contradictory; it would be clearer to state it occupies the \"upper-right quadrant\" or \"center-right area.\" Furthermore, the simple \"pulls back\" description might be incomplete; to achieve the final framing, the camera likely pulls back while also panning slightly right. Finally, the description could be enhanced by clarifying the environment, such as specifying if the \"roadway\" is paved or unpaved (given the \"dusty ground\") and mentioning if the sky becomes visible in the upper frame after the camera pulls back.",
