    "pre_caption": "A blue pencil sketch of a face is positioned in the center of the frame against a white background. The drawing, initially a simple outline of a hooded figure with closed eyes, animates in place. Through a stop-motion sequence, the sketch transforms: the hood becomes styled hair, the eyes open, and details such as a flower pin, a barrette, and a high-collared garment are added. The portrait remains fixed in its central position throughout this evolution, viewed from a consistent, overhead camera angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases the stop-motion animation of a blue pencil sketch of a woman on a white background. The drawing evolves from a dish to a detailed portrait. The completed sketch depicts a woman with dark hair styled in an updo, accessorized with a flower-like pin on one side and a barrette on the other. She has almond-shaped eyes, a neutral expression, and is wearing a high-collared garment with a traditional knot fastening at the neck.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a plain white background, a blue pencil sketch begins with a dish being presented. As the dish is turned over, it reveals a simple outline of a person with closed eyes wearing a hood. The drawing then undergoes a transformation, with the eyes opening and features becoming more defined. Additional details are added, including a styled haircut with a flower and a clip, and the high collar of a garment, completing the portrait.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central framing and the stop-motion evolution of the subject, it omits several key spatial details. It fails to mention the camera's height, which is a static top-down perspective looking directly onto the white paper. The description of the drawing beginning with a \"dish\" is ambiguous; the video actually shows a simple U-shaped curve being drawn first. Most importantly, the caption completely leaves out the artist's hand and blue pencil, which are crucial elements that repeatedly enter the frame from the right to add, blend, and erase lines, and then exit, driving the entire transformation. The description of the dish being \"flipped over\" is also inaccurate; the video shows the initial U-shape being erased and redrawn as the top of the hood, not a literal flip. Finally, the shot size could be more specific; it is a medium close-up, consistently framing the drawing with a small border of the white paper visible around it, rather than an extreme close-up on the lines themselves.",
