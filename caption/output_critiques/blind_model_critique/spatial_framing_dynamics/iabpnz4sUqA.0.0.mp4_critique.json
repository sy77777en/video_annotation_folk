    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a scenic landscape with no major subjects. Initially, the frame captures a forest in the middle ground, with a house in the bottom right and autumn-colored trees in the bottom left. A prominent double rainbow arches across the background sky, with the main arc stretching from the top left toward the center. From a high-angle position, the camera slowly ascends and moves forward, revealing more of the landscape behind the initial treeline. As the camera rises, the forest shifts to occupy the foreground and the lower portion of the frame. The final view shows a highway with moving cars stretching horizontally across the middle ground, with fields and distant buildings visible beyond it, all set beneath the expansive double rainbow in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a focus on the natural landscape, highlighting a rainbow and the expansive view of trees and fields, creating a sense of vastness and tranquility. In the latter portion, a highway with moving cars and several distant buildings come into view, adding a dynamic element to the serene scenery.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor setting transitioning from a residential area to a more open landscape. It is set during the day, with a stunning double rainbow arching across the sky, adding vibrant colors to the scene. The environment features a mix of dense evergreen and deciduous trees, with some displaying autumnal hues of red and orange. In the residential area, houses with sloped roofs are visible, nestled among the trees. As the scene transitions, the landscape opens up to reveal fields and a distant view of a road with vehicles, indicating a rural or suburban area. The sky is overcast, suggesting recent or impending rain, which enhances the visibility of the double rainbow. The overall atmosphere is serene, with natural elements like trees and fields dominating the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as an \"extreme wide shot\" of a landscape and precisely pinpoints the spatial locations of all key elements (forest, house, trees, double rainbow, highway, cars). The description of the camera movement (\"slowly ascends and moves forward\") and the resulting change in perspective (the forest shifting from middle ground to foreground) is spot-on.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally thorough. It addresses every component requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as an \"extreme wide shot.\"\n    *   **Position:** It provides both the 2D position (e.g., \"bottom right,\" \"top left\") and 3D depth (e.g., \"middle ground,\" \"background,\" \"foreground\") for all major elements.\n    *   **Height:** It correctly notes the \"high-angle position\" of the camera.\n    *   **Changes:** It clearly describes the camera's movement and how this dynamically reframes the scene, detailing both the initial and final compositions.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the negative and positive constraints perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or speculative words (\"scenic\" and \"prominent\" are used as objective descriptors of the view and the rainbow's visual weight).\n    *   It focuses exclusively on spatial framing and dynamics, as instructed.\n    *   It successfully describes a scenery shot with no major subjects by focusing on the landscape elements and their movement.",
