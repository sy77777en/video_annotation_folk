    "pre_caption": "This medium close-up shot features a young man positioned slightly left of center in the foreground.

In the background on the left, a whiteboard is partially visible. The camera is positioned at the main subject's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young man with fair skin, messy black hair, and wide blue eyes is shown from the chest up. He wears a white sleeveless sweatshirt with blue stripes over a long-sleeved black undershirt, with a white insignia on his left bicep. He is looking directly at the camera with his mouth open. Partially visible behind him is the back of another person wearing a red jersey with the number \"50\" in black.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene features a brightly lit setting. On the left, a white board displays the black text \"TEAM WHITE\" and \"TEAM RED\". To the right, a person wearing red clothing has the number \"50\" printed in black. A character is prominently featured in the shot.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption correctly identifies the subjects and their basic 2D positions but lacks the required detail for a video description. It completely omits the shot size, such as a medium shot, which is essential for understanding how much of the subjects and their environment are visible. The description is static, failing to capture any movement; for instance, it doesn't mention if the man in white gestures or walks from the center towards the whiteboard on the left, or if the camera pans to follow him. Furthermore, it lacks any sense of 3D depth, failing to specify if the subjects are in the middle ground with the whiteboard in the foreground, or if they are all on the same plane. The camera's height relative to the subjects, such as being at eye-level, is also a critical missing detail. The phrase \"partially visible\" is too vague and doesn't describe how the whiteboard is framed spatially, for example, if it's cut off by the left edge of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium close-up shot of a young man positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. He is wearing a white shirt and is at eye level with the camera. To his right and slightly behind him, another person in a red jersey is visible, occupying the right side of the frame. The scene captures a sense of depth, with both individuals in the middle ground. In the background on the left, a whiteboard is partially visible, cut off by the left edge of the frame. The young man gestures with his hands as he speaks, and at one point, he walks from the center towards the whiteboard. The camera smoothly pans to follow his movement, maintaining the eye-level perspective throughout the scene.",
