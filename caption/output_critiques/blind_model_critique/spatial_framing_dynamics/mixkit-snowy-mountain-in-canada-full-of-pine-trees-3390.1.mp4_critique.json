    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a snow-covered mountain landscape. A prominent mountain peak, covered in snow and trees, occupies the center-left of the frame, extending from the bottom left towards the center. A sea of white clouds fills the middle ground, positioned in the lower and right portions of the frame, partially obscuring the valley below. In the background, a distant, snow-capped mountain range is visible in the top right, rising above the clouds. The sky occupies the top portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking across and slightly down at the main peak. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly and subtly drifts to the right, causing a slight shift in the framing of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a majestic aerial landscape scenery shot of a snow-covered mountain range. A prominent peak, blanketed with dense, snow-dusted evergreen trees, rises sharply in the foreground, its steep face descending towards a vast sea of white clouds that fills the valleys below. In the far distance, another range of jagged, snow-capped mountains is visible above the clouds under a pale blue sky. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to capture the immense scale and serene, powerful atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the grandeur of the wilderness itself, rather than any single object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone provides a high-angle view of a snow-covered mountain peak during the day. The peak and its slopes are covered in white snow and dense, snow-laden evergreen trees. A thick sea of white clouds sits in the valleys below and around the mountain, with the peaks of a more distant, rugged mountain range visible in the background under a clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main elements and the general camera movement, it misses key dynamic and spatial details that would be prominent in such a video. The description of the camera's forward and rightward movement is too general; it should specify the resulting parallax effect, noting how the central peak appears to shift leftward against the distant background, gradually revealing more of the mountain range behind it. The caption also omits the likely movement of the \"sea of white clouds,\" which would probably be seen drifting slowly across the middle ground, adding another layer of motion. Furthermore, the spatial relationship between the main peak and the clouds is ambiguous; clarifying whether the peak is rising from within the cloud layer or stands in front of it would better define the scene's depth. Finally, the description could be improved by noting if any immediate foreground elements, such as a rocky outcrop or tree branches at the bottom edge of the frame, are present, as these would serve as an important visual anchor and enhance the perception of scale and depth.",
