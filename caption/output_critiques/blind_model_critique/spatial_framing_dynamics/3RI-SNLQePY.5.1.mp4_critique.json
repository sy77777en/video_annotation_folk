    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a character is positioned in the center of the middle ground, with the camera following from behind at the character's level. As the character runs forward down a street, it remains centrally framed in the middle ground. Dark, blocky buildings line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the middle ground into the background. In the middle ground to the right, a concrete wall is visible, with a green guard tower and lighter-colored buildings in the background behind it. A vibrant purple sky fills the upper background. As the character progresses, a purple A-frame sign appears in the middle ground on the right. The scene is framed by static user interface elements in the foreground: a status display in the top left, text in the top center and top right, a bar across the bottom, a circular icon in the bottom left, and a mini-map in the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a unique character with a large, round purple head, wearing a colorful, patterned shirt with vibrant hues and beige pants. The character has green limbs and is seen from a third-person perspective, akin to a video game, with the camera following it down a street. The character's head is adorned with a strap in white, black, and purple, and it has teal feet. The setting includes urban elements like buildings with a textured, artistic appearance and a bright pink sky, adding to the surreal atmosphere. A signboard with a similar color scheme becomes visible towards the end of the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video shows a character walking down a street in a stylized urban environment under a vibrant purple sky with white clouds. The street is flanked by dark, blocky buildings with numerous windows, some of which appear weathered. In the distance, lighter-colored buildings and a green guard tower are visible above a surrounding concrete wall. A purple A-frame sign stands on the sidewalk. The scene is presented with several overlay elements, including a dark metallic frame. A heads-up display shows \"Island XP: 206\" and \"So-Tep Items: Dirty Clothes\" in the top left, with green and yellow-green bars. In the top center, the text \"Reactionary\" is displayed in pink. At the bottom, a bar initially displays \"Current Pill: Viagra,\" then briefly changes to \"Current Pill: Adderall,\" and finally to \"Current Pill: THC Extract.\" A circular minimap is located in the bottom right corner. A circular icon in the bottom left starts with a blue geometric shape, then changes to a yellow pencil-like object, and finally to a brown teardrop-shaped object, with the text in the bottom bar and the circular icon changing simultaneously.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject and various environmental and UI elements, but it misinterprets the spatial dynamics of the main character and omits key camera details. It fails to specify the shot size, which is a medium long shot, and the camera's height, which is positioned slightly above and behind the character. The description of the character's movement is inaccurate; rather than \"staying in the foreground,\" the character is walking away from the camera, moving from the foreground deeper into the middle ground. This forward progression is not just a character movement but a camera movement as well, as the camera tracks the character from behind, which is a critical dynamic the caption misses. This tracking shot is what causes the purple A-frame sign to slide into the frame from the right, rather than just \"appearing.\" Additionally, the description of the buildings could be improved by noting that they create strong leading lines that converge in the background, enhancing the sense of depth as the character moves into the scene.",
