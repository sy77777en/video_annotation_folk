    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot of scenery featuring a lighthouse. Initially, the middle section of a dilapidated lighthouse is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame. A turbulent, green-hued sky occupies the background, while streaks of rain fall in the foreground across the entire scene. The camera, positioned at a low angle, slowly tilts upward, following the height of the tower to reveal its dark, caged lantern room at the top. Throughout this movement, the lighthouse remains stationary on the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a somber coastal scenery shot depicting the upper portion of a dilapidated lighthouse against a stormy sky. The tower, made of a pale, weathered material, shows signs of disrepair with boarded-up windows and crumbling sections. It is topped by a dark, caged lantern room. The focus of the scene is on the oppressive atmosphere rather than the structure itself, with heavy rain slanting across the frame and a turbulent, murky green sky creating a bleak and desolate mood. The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A weathered, light-gray lighthouse stands against a dark, turbulent sky during a heavy downpour, with rain falling in white streaks across the scene. The octagonal tower shows signs of disrepair, featuring boarded-up windows and broken sections of masonry. At its peak is a dark, caged lantern room. Behind the structure, the sky is a gloomy expanse of swirling green and gray clouds as the view moves upward along the height of the dilapidated tower. This scene is depicted in a 2D animation.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and effectively captures the spatial dynamics of the video according to the instructions. It is accurate, well-structured, and clear.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is factually accurate based on the elements it describes. It correctly identifies the main subject (lighthouse), its initial framing (middle section), its position (middle ground, right side), and other key elements like the sky (background) and rain (foreground).\n*   The description of the camera movement (\"slowly tilts upward\") and the result (\"reveal its dark, caged lantern room\") is precise and easy to visualize.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D & 3D):** Excellent. It clearly defines the 2D position (\"right side\") and 3D depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for multiple elements.\n*   **Height Relative to Camera:** Correctly identified as a \"low angle.\"\n*   **Changes/Movement:** The caption successfully describes the camera's upward tilt and notes that the subject remains stationary horizontally. It clearly explains the transition from viewing the middle of the lighthouse to its top.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Coherent Paragraph:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that flows logically from the initial state to the dynamic change.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear and avoids jargon.\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** The caption sticks to what is visible and avoids ambiguous or speculative phrases.\n*   **Avoids Emotional/Subjective Adjectives:** This is the only area with a minor deviation. The words \"dilapidated\" and \"turbulent\" are descriptive but lean towards subjective interpretation. While they effectively paint a picture, a stricter adherence to the rule would use more neutral, objective terms (e.g., \"weathered\" instead of \"dilapidated,\" or simply describing the sky's color and cloud movement instead of calling it \"turbulent\"). However, this is a very minor point, as the words are more descriptive than emotional.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is excellent. It meets nearly all the requirements of the prompt with a high degree of precision and clarity. The feedback on subjective adjectives is a fine-tuning suggestion rather than a significant flaw. The caption successfully fulfills its primary goal of describing the spatial framing and dynamics of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a wide shot of scenery featuring a lighthouse. Initially, the middle section of a weathered lighthouse is positioned in the middle ground on the right side of the frame.

The camera, positioned at a low angle, slowly tilts upward, following the height of the tower to reveal its dark, caged lantern room at the top.
