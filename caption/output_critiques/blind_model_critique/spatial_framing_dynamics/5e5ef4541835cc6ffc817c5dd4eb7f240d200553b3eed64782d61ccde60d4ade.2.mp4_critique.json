    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a wolf, capturing its entire body as it lies on a patch of grass. Initially, the wolf is positioned in the center of the frame, with its body oriented towards the left side. In the 2D plane, the wolf occupies the central-left portion of the frame, while in the 3D space, it is in the foreground. The surrounding trees form the middle ground and background, with some trees closer to the wolf and others further away. The camera is at the wolf's level, providing a direct side profile view. As the wolf stands up and moves out of the frame, it exits towards the left, leaving an empty space where it was initially positioned. After the wolf disappears, the shot remains static, focusing on the grassy area and the trees. The remaining scene includes the grass in the foreground, spanning across the bottom of the frame, and the trees in the middle ground and background, filling the rest of the frame. The camera maintains its position at the previous subject's level, continuing to capture the forest setting without any movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wolf with a thick, grayish-brown fur coat, lying on a patch of grass. The wolf is positioned in a forested area, surrounded by tall trees with green and yellow leaves. Its body is oriented to the left, with its head turned slightly in the same direction, giving a side profile view. The wolf appears calm and relaxed. As the video progresses, the wolf disappears from the frame, leaving only the grassy area and trees visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a serene outdoor forest setting during the daytime, characterized by tall trees with textured bark and a scattering of autumn leaves. The ground is covered with patches of green grass and fallen leaves, suggesting a natural, undisturbed environment. The lighting is soft, indicating a clear day with sunlight filtering through the trees, casting gentle shadows. The scene focuses on the forest floor and the surrounding trees, maintaining a tranquil and observational perspective throughout.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is good. It accurately and thoroughly describes the spatial framing and dynamics of the video, adhering to most of the core instructions. However, it could be improved in terms of conciseness and natural language.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the **shot size** (\"full shot\"), the subject's **2D position** (\"central-left portion\"), **3D depth** (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\"), and the **camera's height** (\"at the wolf's level\").\n*   The description of the wolf's movement (\"stands up and moves out of the frame... exits towards the left\") and the static nature of the camera and scene afterward is also correct.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It covers all required aspects: the initial framing of the wolf, the spatial relationship between the wolf and the surrounding trees/grass, the dynamic movement of the wolf exiting the frame, and the final static shot of the scenery.\n*   It successfully describes both the primary subject (the wolf) and the secondary elements (grass, trees) and their respective spatial positions.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Follows Core Task:** The caption focuses exclusively on spatial framing and dynamics as instructed.\n    *   **Avoids Prohibited Content:** It correctly avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and ambiguous language.\n    *   **Structure:** It correctly starts with the shot size and follows a logical progression from the initial state to the final state.\n    *   **Format:** It is presented as a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Natural Language:** The caption is slightly verbose and could be more concise. For example, \"leaving an empty space where it was initially positioned\" could be simplified to \"leaving the frame empty of the subject.\"\n    *   **Redundancy:** There is some minor redundancy. It first says the wolf is \"in the center\" and then clarifies it \"occupies the central-left portion.\" Sticking to the more precise \"central-left\" from the start would be more efficient.\n    *   **Formal Phrasing:** Phrases like \"In the 2D plane...\" and \"in the 3D space...\" are a bit formal and break the natural flow. These concepts can be integrated more smoothly. For instance, instead of \"In the 2D plane, the wolf occupies the central-left portion of the frame, while in the 3D space, it is in the foreground,\" you could write: \"The wolf is in the foreground, positioned in the central-left of the frame.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a strong and successful attempt that fulfills the prompt's requirements. The feedback above is aimed at refining an already good description to make it excellent by improving its conciseness and natural flow.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a full shot of a wolf lying on a patch of grass, positioned in the central-left of the frame and in the foreground. The camera is at the wolf's level, providing a direct side profile view. Surrounding trees form the middle ground and background, with varying distances from the wolf. As the wolf stands and exits the frame to the left, it leaves the frame empty of the subject. The camera remains static, focusing on the grassy area and trees, capturing the forest setting without any movement.",
