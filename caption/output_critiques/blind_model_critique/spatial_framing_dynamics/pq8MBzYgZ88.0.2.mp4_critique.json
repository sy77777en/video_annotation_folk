    "pre_caption": "This full shot opens with a woman pushing a medical cart, positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground of a hospital ward. In the background, a long bank of windows is on the left, and a deep hallway is visible on the right. The camera then pans and tracks to the left, following the woman as she moves across the room. This movement reveals a patient in a hospital bed, who comes to occupy the foreground from the left to the center of the frame. The woman and her cart arrive in the middle ground on the right side of the frame, stopping next to the patient's bed. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with dark, styled hair, wearing a white lab coat over a red dress and dark heels, pushes a wheeled medical cart with equipment on it. She approaches a young person with light brown hair who is lying propped up in a hospital bed. The patient, dressed in white, wears a neck brace and has both legs in casts elevated on pillows. The patient's right hand is in a cast, supported by a bandage around the neck and resting on the chest, while holding a magazine or book on their lap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set during the day inside a large, sparsely populated hospital ward. Bright light streams in through a wide bank of windows covered with white horizontal blinds. The room has light-colored linoleum flooring, white walls, and some sections of wood paneling. Several metal-framed hospital beds with white linens are positioned throughout the space. A woman with dark, styled hair, wearing a white lab coat over a red dress, pushes a tiered, wheeled metal cart carrying a piece of medical equipment. The camera follows her as she moves across the room toward a bed where a person with a neck brace is propped up on pillows, reading a magazine. Two dark-colored armchairs sit near the windows in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately describes the general camera and subject movement, it could be more precise in its spatial details. The initial \"full shot\" designation might be slightly inaccurate; as the camera tracks and the bed enters the foreground, the woman's lower legs and feet are likely obscured, making it closer to a medium-full shot. The description of the patient occupying the space \"from the left to the center\" is also ambiguous; it would be clearer to state that the hospital bed enters from the left to establish the foreground, with the patient positioned within it on the left side of the frame. Furthermore, the claim that the camera is \"at the subjects' level\" is an oversimplification. It is more likely at the standing woman's eye level, which would position it at a slight high angle relative to the patient lying in the bed, a detail that subtly alters the perceived relationship between the two. Finally, the description of the final composition could be enhanced by specifying that the woman stops on the far side of the bed, creating a balanced frame with the patient on the left and the caregiver on the right.",
