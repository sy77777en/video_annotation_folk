    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, two masked men run through a long hall. One man starts in the right foreground, moving toward the left, while a second man runs from the left middle ground toward the right. Other masked figures are visible in the background. As the shot progresses, the men move dynamically across the frame, with the man from the left running behind a teller counter located in the right middle ground. The hall is defined by pillars on the left and counters on the right, with sunlight from the left casting long shadows across the floor. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A group of men, all dressed in dark or dark blue suits, are running and robbing. Each man wears a white clown mask with painted details, such as red smiles or blue accents around the mouths. Some of the men are carrying black handguns, while others hold large bags.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds during the day inside a long, grand hallway of an institutional building, characterized by high ceilings and large, light-colored stone pillars. Sunlight streams through tall windows on the left, casting bright patches and long shadows across a polished, light-colored tiled floor. A row of rectangular, lantern-style light fixtures hangs from the ceiling, supplementing the natural light. Along the right side of the hall are dark wooden teller counters and desks. Several figures wearing suits and masks are sprinting through the space, suggesting they might be involved in a robbery.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the scene's basic composition, but it could be more precise about the subjects' movements and their relationship to the frame. The description of the first man \"moving toward the right\" is ambiguous; it would be clearer to state that he runs diagonally from the right foreground deeper into the scene toward the center middle ground. The caption also misses the dynamic interplay of the subjects, failing to mention that their paths converge as they run. While it notes the presence of long shadows, it neglects to describe how these shadows stretch and move across the floor in tandem with the men, a key visual element. Furthermore, the description of the final positions—\"one positioned in the center...the other on the right\"—could be improved by explicitly linking them to their starting positions, for instance, \"the man from the foreground reaches the center while the second man arrives on the right.\" Finally, the description of the \"other masked figures\" is too vague; specifying if they are stationary or also in motion would provide a more complete understanding of the spatial dynamics in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot, two masked men run dynamically through a long hall. The first man starts in the right foreground and runs diagonally deeper into the scene toward the center middle ground, while the second man begins in the left middle ground and moves toward the right.

The hall is defined by pillars on the left and counters on the right, with sunlight from the left casting long shadows that stretch and move across the floor in tandem with the men.
