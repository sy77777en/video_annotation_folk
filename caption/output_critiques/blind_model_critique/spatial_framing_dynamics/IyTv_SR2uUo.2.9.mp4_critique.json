    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot from a high-angle perspective, looking down a pole vaulting pole at a woman positioned directly below in the center foreground. A large red and white landing mat occupies the middle ground, with a red running track and green field visible in the background. As the woman leans backward, the camera, which is attached to the pole, tilts and rotates with her. This movement transitions the framing to a medium shot, revealing her face and torso as she remains in the center foreground. Concurrently, the entire background scene, including the field and track, rotates around the central axis of the pole, while the landing mat moves out of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with long, dark hair tied in a ponytail is seen from a fixed perspective as she holds a pole vaulting pole. She is wearing a red sports top and black shorts. The video captures her leaning backward with her hands gripping the pole. The pole has white tape wrapped around the grip area and a pink band with the white number \"45\" on it. As she leans back, her face and athletic torso come into full view, and the video ends when her body is approximately parallel to the ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot from a pole vaulting pole captures the action at an outdoor athletics field on a clear day. The camera is aimed down the length of the pole, which is marked with white tape and a pink sticker bearing the number \"45.\" As the athlete leans back during the vault, the pole and attached camera tilt with her, causing the view to rotate. This movement brings her face and torso into full view as her body transitions from a mostly upright position to one nearly parallel with the ground. The perspective spins, offering a rotating view of the green turf infield, the surrounding red running track, and the pole vault standards. In the background, various buildings and a fence line the perimeter of the facility. The video concludes while she is still in the air.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the unique point-of-view and the general rotation of the background, but it misrepresents the scale and dynamics of the action. The initial \"full shot\" is likely inaccurate; from the top of the pole, it would be a medium-long shot showing the woman's upper body and her hands gripping the pole, which itself is a dominant visual element extending down the center of the frame that the caption fails to mention. The description of the athlete's movement as \"leans backward\" is a significant oversimplification of the explosive action of a pole vault; the video shows her planting the pole after a run, causing the camera to swing violently upward in a wide arc, not just \"tilt.\" This arcing motion is the primary dynamic, not a simple rotation. Critically, the caption omits the vaulting bar, which would appear in the frame as the camera rises, and the moment the athlete clears it before descending toward the mat. The transition to a medium shot is correct, but it's a result of the athlete's body swinging up towards the camera, not just a simple camera movement.",
