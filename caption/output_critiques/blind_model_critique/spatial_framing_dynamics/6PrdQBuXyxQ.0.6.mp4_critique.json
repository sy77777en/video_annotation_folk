    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman is initially positioned in the right half of the frame, shown in profile as she looks toward the left. She occupies the foreground, set against a backdrop of mountains that fill the background of the frame. The camera is positioned at her level. She then turns her head to face more toward the center and looks upward, shifting her position to be more central within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with fair skin and blonde hair styled in a bun is shown from the chest up and at a level angle. She is wearing a white, translucent hooded jacket over a dark top, along with a black backpack featuring orange strings that go through the shoulder straps. A circular logo is visible on the left sleeve of her jacket. Throughout the video, she breathes deeply, looking upward and forward with a slight turn of her gaze and a focused expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a mountainous landscape at dawn or dusk, a woman with blonde hair tied in a bun stands against a backdrop of jagged, rocky peaks. The sky is pale. She wears a white, translucent hooded jacket and a black backpack with orange strings that go through the shoulder straps. A circular logo is visible on the left sleeve of her jacket.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the initial shot size, the subject's central position, and the basic camera and head movement. However, it omits key spatial details required by the instructions. It fails to describe the scene's depth; it should specify that the woman is in the middle ground with the mountains in the far background. The description of the camera's height relative to the subject is also missing; a more complete caption would note that the camera is positioned at the woman's eye level. Furthermore, the description of the movement's end state is imprecise. Instead of \"face more toward the right side of the frame,\" it would be clearer to state that the arc concludes with her in a three-quarter view, her gaze directed toward the top right. Finally, the caption could be improved by mentioning if the shot size changes during the camera arc, for instance, if the arc is also a subtle dolly-in, transitioning from a medium close-up to a tighter close-up by the end of the movement.",
