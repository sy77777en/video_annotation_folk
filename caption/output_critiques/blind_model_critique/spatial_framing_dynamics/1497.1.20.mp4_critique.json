    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a dark metal railing is positioned in the left foreground. In the middle ground, a man is initially seen in the center-left of the frame as a large window behind him shatters. A powerful torrent of water bursts from the window, violently pushing the man from his initial position backward and across the frame to the right. As the water floods the middle ground and rushes toward the foreground, the man is seen stumbling on the right side of the scene. A watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark hair, wearing a dark suit jacket over a light-colored shirt, is caught in a powerful surge of water. He is stumbling backward and to the right of the frame due to the force of the rushing water. His body is contorted as he struggles to maintain his balance amidst the violent, splashing water, which appears to be bursting through a shattering window behind him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera is positioned outside, looking into a large, dimly lit indoor space at ground level. In the middle ground, a man stumbles near a mostly shattered window, which breaks further as a powerful torrent of cyan-colored water surges through, flooding the area with great force. In the left foreground, a dark, ornate metal railing is partially visible. A white \"MOVIECLIPS.COM\" watermark is an overlay located in the bottom left corner of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the man's movement is contradictory; stating he is pushed \"across the frame to the right\" while also that he \"remains in the middle of the frame\" is confusing and should be resolved by specifying if the camera pans to follow his movement. The caption could also more vividly describe the spatial chaos by mentioning other objects in the middle ground, such as chairs or tables, and how they are displaced by the water along with the man. The use of \"backward\" to describe the man's movement suggests he is pushed further away from the camera, which would change the shot size from the initial \"full shot\" to a medium or long shot, a detail that is not addressed. Furthermore, the description of the water's movement could be more precise; instead of just \"rushes toward the foreground,\" it could specify if the water splashes against the camera lens or begins to submerge the foreground railing, adding more depth to the action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot filmed at the subject's level, a dark metal railing is positioned in the left foreground. In the middle ground, a man is initially seen in the center-left of the frame as a large window behind him shatters. A powerful torrent of water bursts from the window, forcefully pushing the man from his initial position across the frame to the right. The camera pans to follow his movement, maintaining him in the center of the frame. As the water floods the middle ground, chairs and tables are swept along with the man, adding to the chaos. The man stumbles on the right side of the scene, now in a medium shot. The water surges toward the foreground, splashing against the camera lens and beginning to submerge the railing. A watermark is present as an overlay in the bottom left corner.",
