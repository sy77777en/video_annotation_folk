    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, two human subjects are positioned in the center of the frame, with one in the foreground-left and the other in the middle ground-right, both standing on a checkered floor that occupies the bottom of the scene. Swirling orange light trails move through the foreground and middle ground around the subjects. The camera, initially at the subjects' eye level, cranes upward in a vertical arc around the frozen figures. This movement shifts the perspective to a high-angle view, causing the entire scene to rotate until the subjects appear upside down in the frame, with the checkered floor now positioned at the top.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A darker-skinned individual, wearing a white T-shirt and a green hat, holds a long piece of red fabric in his left hand while extending his right arm to grasp the shoulders of another lighter-skinned individual. The second person, dressed in a white T-shirt, black pants, and a black baseball cap, extends his hands forward, also holding a piece of the red fabric. Bright orange, swirling light trails resembling sparks move around the two individuals as they interact.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene features a black and white checkered floor and light-colored walls adorned with framed pictures. At the center, a black vertical railing stands prominently. Two individuals appear frozen in time, with one resting their right hand on the other's shoulder, both holding a long piece of flowing red fabric. The camera moves in an upward arc around them, enhancing the dynamic composition. The video has a grainy, vintage aesthetic and is presented within black letterbox framing, with bright orange, spark-like, squiggly lines flickering across the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera begins at the eye level of two frozen human subjects, then cranes upward to arc vertically around them, rising above their height before returning to the same level at an upside-down angle.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main camera movement and the final orientation of the scene, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and dynamics. The description of the subjects' positions as \"center of the frame, with one in the foreground-left and the other in the middle ground-right\" is slightly contradictory; it would be clearer to state they collectively occupy the center, with one positioned forward and to the left of the other. The caption also misses the change in shot size; as the camera cranes upward and arcs away, the initial full shot would likely transition into a long shot, making the subjects appear smaller in the frame by the end. Furthermore, describing the light trails as simply moving \"through\" the foreground and middle ground is vague; a more dynamic description, such as \"weaving from the foreground around the subjects into the middle ground,\" would better illustrate their three-dimensional path. Finally, the phrase \"causing the entire scene to rotate\" is an interpretation of the effect rather than a description of the cause; it's more likely that the camera itself rolls on its axis during the crane, which is a more precise way to describe the technical execution that results in the subjects appearing upside down.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a full shot, two human subjects collectively occupy the center of the frame, with one positioned forward and to the left of the other, both standing on a checkered floor that spans the bottom of the scene. Swirling orange light trails weave from the foreground around the subjects into the middle ground, creating a dynamic visual path. The camera, initially at the subjects' eye level, cranes upward in a vertical arc while rolling on its axis, transitioning the shot from a full shot to a long shot, making the subjects appear smaller in the frame. This movement shifts the perspective to a high-angle view, ultimately inverting the scene so the subjects appear upside down, with the checkered floor now positioned at the top.",
