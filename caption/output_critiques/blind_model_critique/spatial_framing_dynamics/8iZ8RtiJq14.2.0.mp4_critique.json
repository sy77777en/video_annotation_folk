    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a corkboard, which serves as the background. Initially, a light blue sticky note with the text \"UNCLE JERRY\" is positioned in the center-bottom of the frame. Directly above it, in the center, a red thumbtack holds multiple red strings that radiate outwards across the frame. A red sticky note, displaying the text \"JEROME JACOBSON,\" then slides into the frame from the right. It moves toward the center, passing underneath the red strings, and settles in the center-bottom of the frame, to the right of the blue note. The camera remains static throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a close-up of a brown, textured corkboard. Several red strings radiate from a central point on the board, held in place by a red, round-headed thumbtack. Pinned beneath the thumbtack is a small, square, light blue sticky note with the words \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in black, block capital letters. Subsequently, another small, square, red sticky note appears to the right of the light blue note, passes through the strings, and appears beneath them. This red note displays the text \"JEROME JACOBSON\" in black, block capital letters.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, featuring a corkboard with a textured, mottled surface. Red strings are pinned to the board, radiating from a central red pin. Two pieces of paper are attached to the board: one is light blue with \"UNCLE JERRY\" written in bold letters, and the other is red with \"JEROME JACOBSON\" inscribed. The strings connect these papers, suggesting a network or connection between them. In the second part of the video, the red sticky note passes through the strings and appears beneath them. The lighting is brighter in the center, highlighting the board's details and the vibrant color of the strings. There is an overlay in the bottom left that says \"[4,5].\"**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a close-up of a corkboard with red strings with several red strings crossing each other, meeting at a central point where a white card is fixed. The white card displays the text \"UNCLE JERRY.\" A red card then appears next to the white card, showing the text \"JEROME JACOBSON.\"\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: It’s unclear whether the corkboard is mounted on a wall or placed on a table, making it difficult to determine the camera’s height relative to it.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a close-up and the main elements: a corkboard, a blue sticky note, a red thumack, red strings, and a red sticky note. The description of the spatial relationships is precise, noting the blue note is at the center-bottom, the thumbtack is in the center above it, and the red note slides in from the right to settle next to the blue one. The detail about the red note passing \"underneath the red strings\" is a crucial and accurate observation of the scene's depth and layering.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and successfully covers all the required aspects of the instructions.\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"close-up shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively describes the 2D positions (center-bottom, center, right) and 3D depth (corkboard as \"background,\" red note moving \"underneath\" the strings).\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The movement of the red sticky note is described in excellent detail, including its entry point, path, and final resting position. It also correctly notes that the camera is static.\n*   **Camera Height:** While the caption doesn't explicitly state the camera's height, for a flat, head-on shot like this, it is implicitly understood to be at the subject's height, making its omission minor and not detrimental to the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n*   It begins with the shot size, then describes the spatial arrangement and concludes with the movement, following a logical structure.\n*   It focuses strictly on the visible spatial framing and dynamics without adding any extraneous information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of what the instructions requested. It is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly follows the stylistic and structural guidelines, resulting in a clear and concise description of the video's spatial composition and movement.",
