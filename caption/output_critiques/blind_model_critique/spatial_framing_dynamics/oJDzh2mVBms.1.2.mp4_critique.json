    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot focused on a winter landscape at night. In the foreground, a large bank of snow fills the bottom of the frame. A tall evergreen tree stands in the center of the frame in the middle ground, flanked by a dense forest of smaller trees that extends across the scene. The background is composed of the night sky, which occupies the upper portion of the frame. Throughout the shot, the green lights of the aurora borealis and clouds are seen moving and swirling across the sky in the background. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up towards the central tree and the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil, snow-covered forest at night. A tall, slender pine tree stands as a central focal point, its dark green needles lightly dusted with snow, anchoring the composition against a backdrop of a dense evergreen forest. The ground is covered in a thick, pristine blanket of white snow. Above, the dark, star-filled sky is dramatically illuminated by the vibrant green glow of the aurora borealis, which swirls and dances in wide bands behind wispy clouds. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on capturing the breathtaking atmosphere and the majestic scale of the natural world, where the celestial light show and the serene winter landscape combine to create a powerful environmental portrait.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor night scene is set in a snowy, forested landscape. The dark sky is illuminated by the vibrant green, shifting lights of the aurora borealis, which swirl above a dense stand of snow-dusted coniferous trees. Stars are visible in the sky between the clouds and the aurora. A tall evergreen tree stands prominently in the center of the scene, while the ground in the foreground is covered in a thick blanket of white snow.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundational structure but misses key dynamic and spatial details that would be prominent in the video. The description of the aurora's movement as \"moving and swirling\" is too generic; it should specify the nature of the motion, such as pulsating curtains of light or rapid vertical dancing, which would also imply the time-lapse nature of the shot. The spatial relationship of the forest is unclear—it doesn't state whether the \"dense forest\" forms a solid wall on the left and right or if it's a more scattered treeline, which significantly changes the composition. Furthermore, the caption oversimplifies the visual elements; the aurora might contain subtle pink or purple hues in addition to green, and the clouds' interaction with the light (e.g., being silhouetted or illuminated) is a critical detail that has been omitted. Finally, the description of the foreground snow lacks texture and form; it could be a smooth, curving drift that acts as a leading line toward the central tree, a compositional element that is currently ignored. The caption also doesn't specify the vertical placement of the central tree, such as whether its peak is contained within the frame or extends beyond the top edge.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a breathtaking winter landscape at night, featuring a dynamic interplay of natural elements. In the foreground, a smooth, curving drift of snow acts as a leading line, guiding the viewer's eye toward a tall evergreen tree that stands prominently in the center of the frame. This tree, whose peak extends just below the top edge of the frame, is surrounded by a dense forest that forms a solid wall on both the left and right sides, creating a sense of enclosure. Above, the night sky is alive with the aurora borealis, displaying pulsating curtains of green light interspersed with subtle pink and purple hues, dancing rapidly in a time-lapse effect. The clouds, silhouetted against the vibrant aurora, add depth and drama to the scene as they interact with the light. The camera's low angle enhances the grandeur of the central tree and the mesmerizing sky above.",
