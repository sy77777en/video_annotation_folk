    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a light-skinned woman positioned centrally in the frame, occupying the foreground. She is shown from the chest up, speaking directly to the camera, which is at her eye level. The background consists of an office environment with computer monitors and glass partitions, positioned in the middle ground and background. The woman initially speaks with her mouth open, then pauses, looking down and to the side, before returning her gaze to the camera. The red banner overlay with the 'BBC NEWS' logo and changing text is located at the bottom of the screen, remaining static throughout the video. The timestamp '15:18' is visible on the bottom right. The spatial composition remains consistent, with no significant changes in shot size or subject position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned woman with shoulder-length, straight, light brown hair and bangs is shown from the chest up, speaking directly to the camera. She is wearing an olive-green jacket over a dark top. Initially, her mouth is open as she speaks, but she then pauses, her expression shifting to one of frustration as she appears to forget her words. She briefly looks down and to the side, her mouth forming a tight line before she mouths a word in exasperation. She then looks back towards the camera with a neutral expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A television broadcast-style viewpoint captures an indoor office environment, likely a newsroom. The background is filled with typical office features, including computer monitors on desks, some displaying news footage. Glass partitions with frosted text, including 'NEWS NI' and 'S NI', separate different areas, and a white office printer is visible on the left. A prominent red banner overlay is positioned at the bottom of the screen, featuring the 'BBC NEWS' logo on the left. The text on this banner changes during the video, initially reading 'PSNI chief \"deeply sorry\" over data breach' and later switching to 'BREAKING'. Below this, 'bbc.co.uk/news' is displayed, and a timestamp '15:18' is visible on the right.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is that it overlooks key spatial dynamics and lacks specificity. While it correctly identifies the medium close-up and the woman's central position, it fails to mention the shallow depth of field that likely renders the middle-ground office environment soft-focused, a crucial technique for separating the subject from the background. The caption's claim that the \"spatial composition remains consistent\" is inaccurate, as it neglects to describe the subtle but constant movement of other office workers visible through the glass partitions in the background, whose blurred forms shift between the left and right sides of the frame. Furthermore, the description of the woman's movement is imprecise; she specifically looks down and to her left, suggesting she is glancing at notes, and her head tilt slightly alters her position within the frame. The caption also misses the dynamic nature of the 'BBC NEWS' banner, where the secondary text is not just \"changing\" but actively scrolling from right to left across the bottom of the screen. Finally, the description could create a clearer sense of depth by distinguishing the computer monitors as being in the immediate middle ground, while the glass partitions and the activity behind them occupy the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a light-skinned woman centrally positioned in the frame, occupying the foreground with a shallow depth of field that softly blurs the office environment in the background. She is shown from the chest up, speaking directly to the camera at eye level. The background includes computer monitors in the immediate middle ground and glass partitions with subtly moving office workers in the background, whose blurred forms shift across the frame. The woman initially speaks with her mouth open, then glances down and to her left, suggesting she is looking at notes, before returning her gaze to the camera, with a slight head tilt altering her position within the frame.
