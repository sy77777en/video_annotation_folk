    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a single man positioned in the center of the frame, viewed from eye level. The camera then pulls back and moves upward, transitioning into a high-angle full shot. In the final frame, a circular table is positioned in the center of the middle ground. The man from the initial shot stands at the top center of the table, while five other men are seated around it, completing the circle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several men rendered in a stylized, blue, particulate fashion against a black background, making them appear as if they are composed of countless tiny, glowing dots. Initially, a single bald man is shown from the chest up, looking forward with a serious expression. He wears a military-style uniform with a collared shirt, epaulets, and an armband on his right sleeve. The view then expands to show this man standing at the head of a dark, circular table, with five other men seated around it. All the men share the same blue, particulate visual style. The seated men are also in uniforms, and some wear glasses. They are depicted in various poses, some leaning forward with their hands on the table, creating the scene of a clandestine meeting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a stark black background, a scene unfolds around a large, circular table with a dark, granular surface. The view begins on a single figure and gradually pulls back and upwards to reveal a group of six humanoid figures seated around the table. Each figure is rendered in a uniform, glowing blue and appears to be constructed from a dense lattice of tiny particles, giving them a porous, digital texture. They are depicted wearing military-style uniforms, with some leaning forward in static poses.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It accurately captures the essential spatial dynamics of the video, follows the structural requirements, and adheres to the stylistic constraints of the instructions. It is clear, concise, and focuses correctly on framing and movement.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **High:** The description of the events is factually correct. The video does start with one man, and the camera pulls up and back to reveal five others around a table.\n*   **Minor Point of Precision:** The initial shot is described as a \"medium shot.\" While acceptable, it is more precisely a **medium close-up**, as the man is framed from the chest up. A standard medium shot typically frames from the waist up.\n*   **Minor Point of Precision:** The caption describes the table in the final frame as being in the \"middle ground.\" In a direct top-down shot (or bird's-eye view), the concept of foreground/middle ground/background becomes less relevant as all subjects are on a similar plane relative to the camera. Describing it as being in the \"center of the scene\" would be more precise for this specific angle.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Excellent:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Initial State:** It correctly identifies the initial shot size (\"medium shot\"), subject position (\"center\"), and camera height (\"eye level\").\n    *   **Transition:** It clearly describes the camera movement (\"pulls back and moves upward\") and the resulting change in shot size and angle (\"transitioning into a high-angle full shot\").\n    *   **Final State:** It details the final composition, including the position of the table (\"center\") and the relative positions of all six men (\"man...stands at the top center...five other men are seated around it\").\n*   **Potential for Improvement:** To be even more descriptive, the final angle could be specified as a **\"top-down\"** or **\"bird's-eye view\"** shot, which is more specific than the broader term \"high-angle.\"\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Excellent:** The caption strictly follows the provided guidelines.\n    *   It is a **single, coherent paragraph**.\n    *   It uses **simple, natural English**.\n    *   It **avoids emotional or subjective adjectives** (e.g., \"dramatic reveal,\" \"interesting composition\").\n    *   It **avoids speculation** and describes only what is visible.\n    *   It focuses entirely on **spatial framing and dynamics**, successfully describing shot size, position (2D and 3D), height, and movement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a high-quality response that meets all the core requirements of the prompt. The minor points on precision (medium close-up vs. medium shot; \"middle ground\" in a top-down view) are subtle and do not detract significantly from the overall quality and accuracy of the description.",
