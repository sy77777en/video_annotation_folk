    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of an anthropomorphic moon positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground, with a projectile lodged in its right eye. Dark, swirling clouds in the foreground frame the scene from the top, bottom, left, and right edges. The camera then zooms in, transitioning to a full shot where the moon and projectile remain centrally located in the middle ground but occupy a larger portion of the frame. The foreground clouds continue to frame the image from the edges. The camera is positioned at the subject's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The central subject is an anthropomorphic Moon, depicted in black and white with a textured, cratered surface that forms a human-like face. This face has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. A large, dark, cylindrical object, shaped like a bullet or a rocket ship, is lodged directly in the Moon's right eye, which is closed as if in reaction. The Moon's overall facial expression suggests discomfort.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a black and white, stylized scene, a large, textured moon with an anthropomorphic face is centered against a black background. The moon's surface is detailed with craters, and it features two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. A dark, cylindrical, projectile-like object is lodged in the moon's right eye. The entire scene is framed by dark, swirling, cloud-like shapes that encircle the central image.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the central subject and its main feature, but the shot size terminology is likely inaccurate for this subject matter; the initial shot is more of a medium shot, showing the moon with surrounding space, which then transitions to a close-up as the moon's face fills the frame, not a \"full shot.\" The description of the movement as \"appears to enlarge and move closer\" is vague; the video actually shows a clear, steady zoom-in, causing the moon to increase in scale and shift from the middle ground to the foreground. Additionally, the caption misses the dynamic spatial relationship between the moon and the clouds. The clouds are not just a static frame at the edges but are a swirling layer in the background. As the camera zooms in on the moon, the moon's form progressively obscures the clouds behind it, a key depth interaction that is not mentioned. Finally, the phrase \"where it occupies a larger portion of the frame\" is redundant, as this is the definition of the shot size changing to a closer view.",

Dark, swirling clouds form a dynamic background layer, framing the scene from all edges.

This zoom-in causes the moon to increase in scale, progressively obscuring the swirling clouds behind it, highlighting the depth interaction between the moon and the clouds. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout the sequence.",
