    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium-full shot of a blurry man lying on the ground in the center background. From a low, ground-level camera angle, a woman's feet in high-heeled sandals walk into the frame from off-screen, stopping in the foreground. The shot composition changes to a close-up of the feet, which are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right of the frame. The man remains out of focus in the center background, now framed between the woman's heels.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a blurry man with dark hair, wearing a dark tank top, lying on the ground in the middle ground, trying to defend himself with both hands after being compelled to the ground by another person. The focus then shifts to a woman stepping into the foreground, with only her feet and ankles visible in a close-up. She is wearing shiny, silver, high-heeled sandals with ankle straps and thick heels, and she appears to be standing to the side of the man.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a dimly lit indoor parking garage with a dark, concrete floor marked by a white painted line. From a level perspective, a pair of silver, metallic high-heeled sandals with thin ankle straps walks into the foreground and stops, framing a view of a blurred figure lying on the ground in the middle ground. The lighting is subdued, with some indistinct light sources visible further away.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium-full shot of a lying man who appears blurry. Soon after that, a woman’s feet come into the frame in the foreground, revealing a closeup shot, blocking part of the man’s body.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the key subjects and their initial and final positions, but it could be more precise about the dynamics of the transition. The term \"medium-full shot\" is slightly ambiguous for a subject lying down; specifying that the man's torso and head are visible would be clearer. The description of the woman's feet walking in is good, but lacks direction; imagining they enter from the top of the frame and walk towards the camera would add a layer of spatial detail. The most significant point for improvement is the phrase \"the shot composition changes to a close-up.\" This is too vague. A more dynamic description would specify *how* this change occurs. For instance, the video might use a rack focus, shifting the plane of focus from the blurry man in the middle ground to the woman's feet as they land sharply in the foreground. This could be combined with a subtle camera push-in that tightens the frame into the final close-up. Clarifying this transition from a medium shot to a close-up via a specific cinematic technique like a rack focus would more accurately capture the shift in visual attention and power within the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a shot of a blurry man lying on the ground, his torso and head visible in the center background. From a low, ground-level camera angle, a woman's feet in high-heeled sandals enter the frame from the top, walking towards the camera and stopping in the foreground. The focus then dynamically shifts through a rack focus technique, transitioning from the out-of-focus man to the sharply defined feet, now positioned at the bottom left and bottom right of the frame. This shift is accompanied by a subtle camera push-in, tightening the frame into a close-up, with the man remaining out of focus in the center background, framed between the woman's heels.",
