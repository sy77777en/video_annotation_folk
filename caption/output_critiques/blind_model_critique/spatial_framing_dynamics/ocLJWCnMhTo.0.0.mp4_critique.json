    "pre_caption": "Initially, the scene is captured in a full shot, with a man standing on a chair positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A thin vertical line bisects the entire frame from top to bottom. In the foreground, the arm of a seated person is visible in the bottom left, a round table is in the center, and several chairs are positioned around it. A stream of fire originates from the man in the middle ground and arcs down toward the table in the foreground. In the background, a door and a small mirror are visible on the left wall. The camera, initially at the subject's level, tilts downwards. This movement shifts the perspective to a high-angle view, causing the man's head to move out of the top of the frame, leaving only his torso and legs visible. Consequently, the black-and-white checkered floor in the foreground and middle ground becomes the dominant visual element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin stands in the center-right of the view, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt with a small, colorful graphic on the chest and light-colored, loose-fitting pants. He is performing an act of fire-making, with a stream of fire arcing from near his left hand downwards. As the video progresses, the camera cranes upward, causing the man's head to move out of the frame, leaving his torso and legs visible. Meanwhile, the arm and hand of a second person, who appears to be seated, are consistently visible in the bottom left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a room with white walls and a black-and-white checkered tile floor. The ceiling is a pale blue, and the space is sparsely furnished, featuring a round table with a reflective surface and a metallic frame, as well as some metal chairs with a simple, functional design. The lighting is even, and the environment has a clean, geometric appearance with sharp lines and right angles. A person is present, standing on a chair near the table, dressed in light-colored clothing that contrasts with the patterned floor. Another person is partially visible, sitting in another chair also near the table. There is a thin vertical line bisecting the view and a subtle orange spark-like visual near the center, which are part of the physical scene. The scene is framed on both sides by shaking black borders.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video initially shows a full shot of a person. As the camera moves, the person’s head gradually moves out of the frame, leaving the body below the chest visible, while part of another person’s body appears in the bottom left corner.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the sequence of events and the camera movement, but it could be more precise in its spatial terminology and detail. The term \"full shot\" might be inaccurate; if the man is standing on a chair, the shot is more likely a medium-long shot that frames him from head to just below his feet. The description of the camera movement resulting in a \"bird's-eye view\" is an overstatement; a crane movement from the subject's level would create a high-angle shot, not a direct 90-degree overhead perspective. Furthermore, describing the checkered floor as becoming the \"dominant visual element in the background\" is spatially confusing; the floor becomes the primary ground plane of the composition, while the actual background elements like the door and painting would become less visible or exit the frame entirely. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the \"thin vertical line\" more specifically; for instance, it appears to be a dark, textured support beam slightly to the left of the frame's center, not perfectly bisecting it. Lastly, the description of the action is incomplete, as it fails to mention that the stream of fire extinguishes just as the camera begins its upward crane, and the arm in the foreground simultaneously retracts and moves out of the bottom-left of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene opens with a medium-long shot of a man standing on a chair, positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. A dark, textured support beam, slightly left of center, runs vertically from top to bottom.

A stream of fire originates from the man and arcs down toward the table. In the background, a door and a small mirror are visible on the left wall. The camera, initially at the subject's level, tilts downward, transitioning to a high-angle view.
