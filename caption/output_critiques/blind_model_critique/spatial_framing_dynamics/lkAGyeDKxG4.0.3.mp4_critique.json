    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the foreground. The background is an out-of-focus, cool-toned landscape. Throughout the clip, the man's head moves slightly, turning from side to side and looking down, while the camera maintains a tight, centered framing on his face. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned man with brown hair, a mustache and stubble, and blue eyes is shown in a close-up. He wears a black high-collared jacket and a backpack with visible orange straps and a white reflective strip. Throughout the video, he appears to be breathing heavily with his mouth open, and his expression is strained as he looks around and briefly closes his eyes. He also brushes his hair back with his hand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor setting under overcast or foggy conditions, a man with brown hair and light facial hair is seen in a close-up. He is wearing a black jacket that has orange straps and reflective strips over the shoulders. The background is an out-of-focus, cool-toned wash of blue and grey. The man breathes with his mouth open.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the shot size and the subject's central position, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The term \"close-up\" is general; specifying it as a \"medium close-up\" would be more accurate if the man's shoulders are visible, which would better define how much of the foreground he occupies. The description of the background as \"cool-toned\" is subjective; instead, it would be more objective to describe the blurry elements spatially, such as \"out-of-focus trees in the background left and a hazy sky in the background right.\" Most importantly, the description of the man's head movement lacks spatial detail. Rather than just stating he turns his head, the caption should describe the resulting spatial shift—for instance, as he turns to the right, his left cheek moves forward, becoming the most prominent element in the foreground, and when he looks down, the top of his head angles toward the camera, occupying the upper-center of the frame. Finally, stating the camera \"maintains a tight, centered framing\" might overlook subtle movements; if the camera has a slight handheld drift, this should be noted as it creates a minor but constant re-framing of the subject within the center.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned centrally in the foreground, with his shoulders visible. The background features out-of-focus trees on the left and a hazy sky on the right.

When he looks down, the top of his head angles toward the camera, occupying the upper-center of the frame.
