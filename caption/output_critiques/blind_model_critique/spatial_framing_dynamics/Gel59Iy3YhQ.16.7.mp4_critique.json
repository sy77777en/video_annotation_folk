    "pre_caption": "This wide shot is framed with a large, multi-leveled purple structure occupying the middle ground on the right side of the scene. A small, white, bipedal character is positioned in the center-left, climbing a patch of green vines on the structure's face. Other small, white creatures are located on ledges above the main character in the middle ground. In the background, a smaller floating platform is visible in the top-left, all set against a dark, starry sky. As the main character climbs vertically up the vines, the camera pans upward to follow, revealing the upper sections of the main structure, a new floating platform with a chest in the top-left background, and another platform in the top-right background, while the lower levels move out of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, white, pixelated character with a round body and a rectangular head is depicted climbing a patch of green, pixelated vines. The character has three black dots on its face representing the eyes and mouth, and a red dot on top of its head. On ledges above this character, there are other small, white, pixelated creatures with a blocky, bird-like shape. These creatures are not entirely motionless; they exhibit subtle hopping movements. All the figures are rendered in a simple, two-dimensional, blocky art style.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a collection of floating, purple, block-like structures against a dark, starry night sky. These multi-leveled structures are made of purple blocks with some mossy green patches and are adorned with small tufts of grass along their flat tops. A large patch of green, pixelated vines runs vertically up the face of the main structure, and thin, vertical waterfalls cascade down its side. In the background, other smaller, disconnected platforms float in the dark expanse. A small, white, bipedal character climbs the vines, and the camera moves upward while tracking to the right to follow its movement, revealing more of the towering structure and a small, floating platform with a chest on it.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly aligns with all aspects of the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is factually correct in its description. It accurately identifies the shot size, the subjects (character, creatures), key elements (structure, platforms, vines), their specific 2D and 3D positions within the scene, and the camera's height relative to the subject. The description of the camera and subject movement is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It covers all the required components:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identifies the \"wide shot.\"\n    *   **Spatial Position:** Details the 2D (right, center-left, top-left) and 3D (middle ground, background) positions for all significant elements.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** Clearly explains the character's vertical climbing movement and the corresponding upward camera pan, detailing what new elements are revealed and what moves out of the frame.\n    *   **Camera Height:** Explicitly states that the camera remains at the subject's level.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption strictly follows the stylistic and content rules:\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n    *   It focuses entirely on spatial framing and dynamics, not on narrative or interpretation.\n    *   It successfully describes the initial static frame and then the dynamic changes as they occur, creating a clear picture of the video's visual flow.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This wide shot features a large, multi-leveled purple structure prominently in the middle ground on the right. A small, white, bipedal character is climbing green vines on the structure's face, positioned center-left. Above the main character, other small, white creatures are perched on ledges in the middle ground. In the background, a smaller floating platform is visible in the top-left, all set against a dark, starry sky. As the main character ascends the vines, the camera pans upward, revealing the upper sections of the main structure, a new floating platform with a chest in the top-left background, and another platform in the top-right background, while the lower levels move out of the frame. The camera consistently stays level with the subject throughout the shot.",
