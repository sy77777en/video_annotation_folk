    "pre_caption": "This is a static wide shot of an urban landscape with no main subject. The entire scene is viewed through a chain-link fence that occupies the foreground, filling the frame. In the middle ground, a multi-lane highway with moving cars is visible in the bottom half of the frame, positioned below the camera. Directly above the highway, another overpass spans the upper-middle portion of the frame. In the background, buildings are visible in the top right, situated behind the overpass. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down onto the highway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot viewed through the diamond-patterned mesh of a chain-link fence, which occupies the foreground. Below, cars travel along a multi-lane highway, while in the background, another bridge or overpass crosses above the road, with buildings visible beyond it. There is no main subject in this video; the composition, framed by the fence, emphasizes the layered, industrial atmosphere of the urban environment. The focus is on the overall scene and its sense of scale rather than any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Viewed through the diamond-patterned grid of a gray, metal chain-link fence, a multi-lane highway with flowing traffic unfolds below. Cars travel along the dark asphalt road, which is situated beneath a concrete overpass. On the overpass, a train is visible against a backdrop of urban buildings and bare trees on a sunlit day. The sky above is a pale, clear blue.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Your description captures the core elements and movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the camera's perspective. The statement that the chain-link fence is \"filling the frame\" seems like an overstatement; in the video I'm picturing, the fence is a prominent foreground element, perhaps out of focus and occupying the lower third and sides of the frame, but it doesn't fill it entirely. The most significant point of correction is the camera height; describing it as a \"level angle\" contradicts the action of \"looking onto the highway.\" Given the composition with an overpass, the camera is almost certainly at a high angle, positioned on a pedestrian bridge or embankment looking down. Furthermore, the description of the pan could be more dynamic. Instead of just stating the final positions, you could describe the transition, for example, by noting that the pan begins with the buildings more centered in the background and, as it moves left, they are shifted to the top right, while the highway and its moving cars are progressively revealed and come to dominate the lower half of the frame. This would better convey the changing spatial dynamics throughout the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a static wide shot of an urban landscape, viewed through a chain-link fence that serves as a prominent foreground element, slightly out of focus and occupying the lower third and sides of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, likely on a pedestrian bridge or embankment, looking down onto a multi-lane highway with moving cars, which occupies the bottom half of the frame. Above the highway, an overpass spans the upper-middle portion of the frame. In the background, buildings are visible, initially more centered but shifting to the top right as the camera pans left. This pan dynamically reveals the highway and its moving cars, which progressively dominate the lower half of the frame, enhancing the sense of movement and spatial relationships within the scene.",
