    "pre_caption": "The video starts with an extreme wide shot, capturing a vast, dark expanse with a small, illuminated circular pit in the center. Two individuals, both in white shirts, appear near the edge of the pit. Initially, they are positioned at the bottom of the frame, close to the center, in the foreground. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, bringing the subjects more into view while maintaining their central positioning. The two individuals lean over the pit, their upper bodies now more visible as they look downward. The camera remains consistently above the subjects throughout, providing a top-down perspective. The pit stays in the center of the frame, serving as the focal point, with the subjects positioned around its edge. The overall scene retains its minimalistic quality, with the dark surroundings and earthy textures emphasizing the central action. The camera's fixed overhead angle ensures a clear view of the subjects' movements and positions relative to the pit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two individuals, both wearing white shirts, viewed from above. They are leaning over what appears to be the edge of a well, looking downward. **\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an outdoor setting viewed from an objective perspective, focusing on a circular pit or well in the ground. The environment is earthy, with the ground appearing dark brown and textured, suggesting soil or dirt. The time of day is indeterminate due to the lack of natural light cues. The scene features two people in white clothing leaning over the edge of the pit. Most of the scene is quite dark, with only the central area being slightly illuminated. The setting is minimalistic, with no additional architectural or natural features visible. Overlay elements include small text in the bottom left corner displaying \"[8,12],\" which is not part of the scene itself.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good. It is well-structured, detailed, and accurately follows the majority of the instructions. It successfully describes the spatial framing, subject positioning, and dynamics of the scene in a clear and coherent paragraph. However, there are minor areas where it deviates from the strict objectivity requested.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe description is accurate and internally consistent. It logically describes a scene starting with an extreme wide shot that transitions to a wide shot, focusing on two subjects interacting with a central pit from an overhead perspective. The details provided about positioning, movement, and camera angle create a clear and believable mental image of the video's content.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial \"extreme wide shot\" and the transition to a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively describes the 2D position of the pit (\"center\") and the subjects (\"bottom of the frame, close to the center\") as well as their 3D position (\"foreground\").\n*   **Depth:** The use of \"foreground\" for the subjects and the description of the \"vast, dark expanse\" implicitly create a sense of depth.\n*   **Camera Height:** It clearly states the camera is \"consistently above the subjects\" and provides a \"top-down perspective.\"\n*   **Changes/Movement:** It details the shot size transition and the subjects' movement (\"lean over the pit\").\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to the instructions very well, but with a few minor exceptions.\n\n**Strengths (What it does well):**\n*   **Structure:** It follows the requested structure, starting with shot size, then moving to subject position, and finally camera height and movement.\n*   **Clarity:** It uses simple, natural English, making the description easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** It largely avoids speculation and ambiguous phrasing like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Areas for Improvement (Minor Deviations):**\n*   **Avoidance of Subjective Adjectives:** The caption includes the phrase \"minimalistic quality,\" which is a subjective aesthetic judgment rather than an objective spatial description.\n*   **Avoidance of Interpretation:** The phrases \"emphasizing the central action\" and \"ensures a clear view\" describe the *effect* or *purpose* of the framing, which is an interpretation. The instructions ask to describe the framing itself, not why it is effective.\n*   **Focus on Spatial Details:** The mention of \"earthy textures\" is a detail about the surface material, not its spatial framing or position.\n\n### Revised Example for Perfect Adherence\n\nTo illustrate the minor corrections, here is how the last two sentences could be revised to be strictly objective and spatially focused:\n\n**Original:** \"The overall scene retains its minimalistic quality, with the dark surroundings and earthy textures emphasizing the central action. The camera's fixed overhead angle ensures a clear view of the subjects' movements and positions relative to the pit.\"\n\n**Revised for Stricter Adherence:** \"The scene is composed of the central illuminated pit and the two subjects, which are surrounded by a dark, featureless expanse. The camera's fixed overhead angle maintains a direct, top-down view of the subjects and their positions relative to the pit throughout the video.\"",
