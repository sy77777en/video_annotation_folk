    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a climber positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, scaling a large rock face. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, follows the climber's movements, causing the framing to tighten into a medium shot that shows the climber from the waist up. Around the three-second mark, another person's head briefly enters the bottom right foreground. Shortly after, a pink-sleeved arm becomes visible in the same bottom right foreground position, gesturing toward the central climber. The shot ends as a medium shot with the main climber in the center middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with dark brown hair falling to the shoulder, held in place by the strap of a headlamp, is shown rock climbing in a dark, confined space. They are wearing a dark brown long-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and a headlamp that illuminates the rough, grey rock face directly in front of them. Seen from a low angle, the climber uses both hands to grip crevices in the rock, contorting their body as they navigate the climbing route. The headlamp creates a bright, focused circle of light, leaving the rest of the scene and the climber's features in deep shadow. Around the three-second mark, another man's head with red hair briefly appears in the bottom right corner of the frame, looking towards the climber. Additionally, around the four-second mark, a left arm in a pink-sleeved jacket is momentarily visible in the bottom right corner, gesturing towards the climber.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Inside a dark cave, a person is bouldering on a large, gray rock formation. The scene is illuminated by the climber's headlamp, which casts deep shadows and highlights the rough, granular texture of the rock face. The climber, wearing dark clothing, moves across the rock, their hands gripping crevices as the focused beam of light follows their path through the otherwise pitch-black surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the main climber's spatial depth is contradictory, stating they move from the foreground to the middle ground and back to the foreground without a clear corresponding camera or subject movement. It is more plausible that the climber remains consistently in the center foreground on the rock face, and the caption mistakenly reclassifies their depth when the pink-sleeved arm, another foreground element, appears. The phrase describing the arm's appearance \"in the same bottom right foreground position\" is also confusing, as the previously mentioned head was in the middle ground; it would be clearer to state the arm enters the bottom right foreground, distinct from the head in the bottom right middle ground. Additionally, the transition from a full to a medium shot could be more accurately attributed to a camera tilt upwards that follows the climber's ascent, naturally reframing them from the hip up. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the rock face, which likely dominates the frame and serves as the immediate middle ground and background for the entire scene.",
