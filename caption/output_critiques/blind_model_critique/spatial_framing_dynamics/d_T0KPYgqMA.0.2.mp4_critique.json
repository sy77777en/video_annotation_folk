    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot of a woman in a courtroom, capturing her from the chest up. Positioned in the foreground and slightly off-center to the right, she dominates the scene. Her 2D position is central-right, while in 3D space, she is in the foreground, clearly the focal point. Behind her, in the middle ground, several individuals are seated, forming a background audience. These figures occupy the upper-left portion of the frame, with their 2D positions spread across the left side. Their 3D placement is further back compared to the main subject. The camera remains steady throughout, maintaining a consistent shot size and angle. There are no noticeable changes in the spatial arrangement or camera movement between the beginning and end of the video. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, emphasizing her prominence in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman in a courtroom setting, wearing a traditional barrister's wig and black robe with white bands. She appears to be speaking, with a focused expression. In the background, there are several people seated, including a man in a suit and glasses, a woman with long hair, and another woman with blonde hair. The woman in the foreground is the primary subject, and her attire and position suggest she is addressing the court. The background figures are less distinct, serving as an audience to the proceedings.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a courtroom, characterized by wooden paneling and a formal atmosphere. The time of day is indeterminate due to the controlled lighting typical of indoor settings. The scene features a legal professional in traditional attire, including a wig and robe, likely addressing the court. In the background, several people are seated, possibly jurors or observers, adding to the formal and serious environment. The setting emphasizes the solemnity and focus of the courtroom proceedings, with the legal professional's speech and people in the background introducing some movement and activity.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully identifies and describes most of the required spatial elements, such as shot size, subject positions, and camera height. However, it fails to fully adhere to the instructions regarding conciseness and objectivity.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy & Completeness (Strengths):**\n\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as a \"medium close-up\" and accurately describes it as \"capturing her from the chest up.\" This fulfills the first requirement of the instructions.\n*   **Spatial Positions:** It correctly identifies the woman's 2D position (\"off-center to the right\") and 3D position (\"foreground\"). It also correctly places the secondary subjects in the \"middle ground\" and on the \"upper-left\" side of the frame.\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption accurately states that the camera is positioned at the \"subject's eye level.\"\n*   **Dynamics:** It correctly notes the lack of movement, stating that the \"camera remains steady\" and there are \"no noticeable changes.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions (Weaknesses):**\n\n*   **Conciseness and Redundancy:** The caption is not concise. It repeats information multiple times, which violates the instruction to create a \"concise\" and \"coherent paragraph.\"\n    *   **Example 1:** The woman's position is described twice in back-to-back sentences: \"Positioned in the foreground and slightly off-center to the right...\" is immediately followed by \"Her 2D position is central-right, while in 3D space, she is in the foreground...\"\n    *   **Example 2:** The static nature of the shot is also stated twice: \"The camera remains steady throughout...\" is followed by \"There are no noticeable changes in the spatial arrangement or camera movement...\" These could be combined into a single, more efficient statement.\n    *   **Example 3:** It states the background figures are in the \"middle ground\" and then adds, \"Their 3D placement is further back compared to the main subject,\" which is redundant.\n\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption includes subjective and interpretive language, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\").\n    *   **Example 1:** \"...she **dominates the scene**.\" This is an interpretation of her visual weight, not a neutral spatial description.\n    *   **Example 2:** \"...**clearly the focal point**.\" While true, this states the *effect* of the framing rather than just describing the framing itself.\n    *   **Example 3:** \"...**emphasizing her prominence in the scene**.\" This explains the director's intent or the shot's effect, which is speculative and subjective. The instruction is to describe *what* is there, not *why* it is framed that way or what it achieves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption demonstrates a good understanding of how to analyze spatial framing. However, to be fully compliant with the instructions, it needs to be revised to eliminate redundant sentences and remove all subjective or interpretive phrases. A better version would merge the repeated points and stick strictly to objective, descriptive language.",
