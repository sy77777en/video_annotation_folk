    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot focusing on the ballet dancer's feet. The feet, clad in well-worn pointe shoes, occupy the central area of the frame, positioned in the foreground. Initially, one foot is slightly ahead of the other, both en pointe. As the sequence progresses, the feet shift subtly, maintaining their central placement while adjusting their stance. The dancer's feet remain the primary focus throughout, with no significant change in their 2D position within the frame. The background is minimalistic and light-colored, providing a neutral backdrop that keeps attention on the feet. The camera is at the subject's level, capturing the detailed movements and positioning of the feet without any noticeable elevation changes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up of a ballet dancer's feet, showcasing the dancer wearing well-worn, light-colored pointe shoes. The shoes have visible scuffs and wear, indicating frequent use. The dancer's feet are positioned en pointe, demonstrating balance and precision. The dancer has a tanned or darker skin tone, visible through the openings of the shoes, and the crossed ribbons are tied securely around the ankles. The focus is on the technical skill and elegance of the dancer's footwork.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a dancer's feet in worn, beige pointe shoes, performing on a smooth, light-colored surface that resembles a stage or dance floor. The bright, even lighting and soft shadows suggest it could be midday, but the setting remains ambiguous, leaving it unclear whether the scene is indoors or outdoors. The shoes show signs of wear, with visible scuffs and frayed edges, highlighting their fabric material. The minimalist background emphasizes the dancer's movements and the texture of the shoes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the close-up shot and the low camera angle, it misrepresents the subject's movement as a \"subtle shift\" and incorrectly states that the feet \"maintain their central placement.\" The video actually features significant dynamic movement; the dancer's feet, initially centered, perform a series of rapid steps that travel horizontally from the left side of the frame to the right. This horizontal movement is a major spatial change that the caption completely misses. Additionally, the description fails to mention that after this travel, the dancer transitions into a turn on one foot, which remains in the center-foreground while the other foot lifts out of the frame entirely. The caption would be more accurate if it described this progression from a two-footed horizontal movement to a single-footed rotational movement, detailing how the spatial composition of the subject changes from a pair to a single point of focus.",
