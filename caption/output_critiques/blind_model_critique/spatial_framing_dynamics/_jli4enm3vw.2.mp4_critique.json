    "pre_caption": "This wide shot captures a human tower being constructed in the center-middle ground of a narrow street, framed by beige buildings in the background. The scene is viewed from the perspective of the crowd, with the back of a man in a pink shirt occupying the left foreground at the start. The viewpoint then shifts slightly, bringing the head and shoulder of a woman, also in a pink shirt, into the left foreground. The tower is surrounded by a large group of participants and spectators in the middle ground. A red and white circular sign is positioned in the right middle ground. The camera remains at the level of the crowd throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a group of people, primarily men, constructing a human tower on a street. These individuals wear a uniform consisting of blue long-sleeved shirts, white trousers, and a wide black sash tied around their waists. The tower is several levels high, with each person standing on the shoulders of the people below, and is topped by a small child also wearing a blue shirt. A large crowd of men and women surrounds the tower, with many wearing the same blue and white uniform, actively supporting the base or watching. In the foreground, a man with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a bright pink t-shirt, and a woman with blonde hair tied up, carrying a dark backpack, are seen from behind as they observe the performance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This daytime scene takes place on a narrow, crowded street lined with multi-story, beige-colored buildings featuring dark, wrought-iron balconies. In the center of the street, a group of people wearing blue shirts, white pants, and sashes forms a multi-level human tower. The surrounding crowd of spectators watches the event unfold. Storefronts are visible at street level, and a red and white circular \"No Entry\" sign is posted on a pole.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the wide shot and the general placement of the human tower, buildings, and foreground crowd, it misses the primary dynamic action of the scene. It states the tower is \"being constructed\" but fails to describe the visible upward movement of the climbers as they scale the structure, which is the central event. The description of the camera movement as a \"slight shift\" is vague; a more specific term like a slight pan or reframing to the right would better explain why the man in the pink shirt is replaced by the woman in the foreground. Furthermore, the caption doesn't fully capture the framing effect of the foreground crowd, which creates a sense of immersion and a frame-within-a-frame for the main subject. Finally, while the red and white sign is mentioned, its specific location on one of the background buildings could be specified to add more spatial clarity to the scene's composition.",
