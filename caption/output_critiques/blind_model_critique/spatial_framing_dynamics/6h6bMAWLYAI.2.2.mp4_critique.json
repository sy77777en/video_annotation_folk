    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up shot of a middle-aged man, centrally positioned in the frame, indicating he is the main subject. He is surrounded by microphones and cameras, which occupy the foreground, emphasizing the press event setting. The man is at the center, with his face and upper body visible, while other individuals are partially visible around him, including a person in a striped shirt on the left and another individual with dark hair on the right, both in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, maintaining focus on his face as he speaks. The scene remains tightly framed around the main subject throughout, with no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning. Overlays with text are present at the bottom and top right of the frame, providing context for the event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a slightly overweight, middle-aged Caucasian man with light skin and short, light-colored hair, who appears to be the main subject. He is speaking at a press event, surrounded by microphones and cameras, indicating a public setting. The man is wearing a black suit with a white shirt underneath and is positioned centrally, suggesting he is the focus of attention. Around him, several people are visible, including a person in a striped shirt holding a camera, and another individual with dark hair partially obscured by equipment. The scene is crowded, with the main subject addressing the media, highlighting a formal and possibly tense atmosphere.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a broadcast POV shot set up for television production, takes place indoors at a city hall setting. The environment is bustling with activity, featuring a crowd of people and numerous microphones positioned prominently in the foreground, indicating a press conference. The lighting is bright, typical of indoor artificial lighting used in such events. The scene is framed tightly around a central figure speaking, surrounded by journalists and cameras. Overlays include text at the bottom of the screen, providing context with phrases like \"Rob Ford Speaks at City Hall\" and \"Happening Now,\" along with a news ticker summarizing the event. In the upper right corner of the frame, there is an overlay logo text that reads \"LIVE.\" The overall atmosphere is dynamic, with the focus on the interaction between the speaker and the media.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central subject and the general composition, it overlooks several key spatial dynamics and details. The statement that there are \"no significant changes\" is inaccurate, as the camera executes a slow, continuous zoom-in throughout the video, transitioning the shot from a medium close-up to a tight close-up on the man's face, increasing the intensity of the moment. The caption also misses the subject's own movement; he is not static but leans forward and turns his head from left to right, with the camera performing subtle pans to keep his face centered. The description of depth could be more precise by mentioning the shallow depth of field, which blurs both the foreground microphones at the bottom of the frame and the two individuals in the background, who are positioned directly behind the man's shoulders rather than just generally to his left and right. This specific placement creates a triangular composition that is a key framing element. Finally, the caption should note that the cluster of microphones in the foreground partially obscures the podium and the lower part of the man's chest, acting as a distinct framing layer.",
