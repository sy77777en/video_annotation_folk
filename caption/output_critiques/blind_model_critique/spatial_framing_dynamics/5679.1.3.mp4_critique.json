    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Tall, light-green grass occupies the foreground, partially obscuring his lower body. In the background, there is dense green foliage, trees, and a wooden deck structure. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The shot then changes to a wide shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light-brown skin, long dark dreadlocks, a mustache, and a beard stands still facing the camera. He wears a bright orange, ribbed turtleneck sweater and blue pants. In his left arm, he carries a piece of firewood, and in his right hand, he holds a small axe with a wooden handle, pointing it forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a lush, green environment, likely a garden or forested area, with dense foliage and tall trees surrounding a wooden deck. The time of day appears to be daytime, with natural light illuminating the area. A person is standing still among tall grasses, wearing a bright orange sweater and blue pants, carrying a piece of wood and a tool, and gesturing with their right hand. The setting includes a rustic wooden structure, possibly a cabin, partially visible in the background, blending with the natural surroundings. The overall atmosphere is serene and natural, with the greenery and wooden elements creating a harmonious blend with the environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation but misses key details about the spatial transition and the composition of the second shot. The phrase \"The shot then changes\" is ambiguous; it should specify if this is a hard cut or a continuous camera movement, such as a zoom-out. If it is a zoom, the description should note this dynamic. The critique of the second shot is incomplete, only stating it becomes a \"wide shot.\" It should describe the man's new position within this wider frame—for example, he might now occupy the bottom center—and detail the additional scenery that the wider perspective reveals, such as the full height of the trees in the background or a stone path in the foreground that was previously out of frame. Additionally, the initial description of the background could be more specific by assigning 2D positions to the elements, such as placing the \"wooden deck structure\" in the right background to give a clearer sense of the scene's layout from the start.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium full shot of a man standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Tall, light-green grass occupies the foreground, partially obscuring his lower body. In the background, dense green foliage and trees are visible, with a wooden deck structure positioned in the right background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The shot then transitions with a smooth zoom-out to a wide shot, revealing the man now occupying the bottom center of the frame. This wider perspective unveils the full height of the trees in the background and a stone path in the foreground that was previously out of frame, enhancing the scene's depth and context.",
