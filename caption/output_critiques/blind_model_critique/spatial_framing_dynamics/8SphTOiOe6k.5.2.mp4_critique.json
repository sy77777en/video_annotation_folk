    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot capturing a bustling street scene. In the foreground, a group of schoolchildren in dark uniforms with backpacks is positioned near the bottom center, close to a shop entrance, occupying the middle ground. They are framed collectively, with the shop's decorative elements like hanging ornaments visible above them. In the background, several adults walk along the street, positioned towards the left and right, dressed in casual attire. Some wear face masks, and they are spread across the middle ground and background, contributing to the lively atmosphere. The camera is at the subjects' height, providing a first-person perspective. As the scene transitions, the camera pans slightly to the right, maintaining the wide shot. The schoolchildren remain in the foreground, while the adults continue to move along the street, with some entering the frame from the right. The traditional Japanese architecture and decorative elements remain constant in the background, enhancing the urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a bustling street scene with multiple people engaged in various activities. In the foreground, a group of schoolchildren wearing matching dark uniforms with backpacks gather near a shop entrance. Nearby, several adults walk along the street, dressed in casual attire, including jackets and sweaters. Some individuals wear face masks. The scene includes a mix of men and women, with diverse clothing styles and colors. The setting suggests a lively, public area with shops and pedestrians moving about.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot, capturing an outdoor setting in a bustling street lined with traditional Japanese architecture. The time of day is likely midday, with clear skies and scattered clouds. The environment features a mix of wooden and tiled structures, with one building displaying a sign adorned with Japanese characters. The street is lively, with groups of people, some in uniform, gathered near a shop entrance, and others strolling along the pathway. The ground is paved with stone, and there are decorative elements like hanging ornaments and a display stand with stickers. Trees with autumn foliage add a touch of color to the scene, and overhead power lines stretch across the sky, contributing to the urban atmosphere.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Spatial Positioning:** The caption contains a significant contradiction. It initially states the schoolchildren are \"in the foreground\" and also \"occupying the middle ground\" in the same sentence. A subject cannot be in two different depth planes simultaneously. It later states they \"remain in the foreground,\" which adds to the confusion. This is a critical error in describing spatial depth.\n*   **Interpretive vs. Factual Description:** The phrase \"traditional Japanese architecture\" is an interpretation. The instruction is to describe what is visible (e.g., \"buildings with tiled roofs and wooden lattices\") rather than classifying it. Similarly, \"providing a first-person perspective\" is an interpretation of the camera angle's effect, not a direct description of its spatial relationship to the subjects.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   **Good Coverage:** The caption successfully attempts to cover all the required elements: shot size (wide shot), 2D position (bottom center, left, right), 3D position (foreground, middle ground, background), camera height (at the subjects' height), and movement (camera pan, subjects walking).\n*   **Multiple Subjects:** It effectively describes the primary subjects (schoolchildren) and secondary subjects (adults), as well as background elements.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption fails to follow this rule. It uses several subjective words, including \"bustling,\" \"decorative\" (used twice), and \"lively.\" These words describe a feeling or quality rather than an objective spatial reality.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The caption includes interpretive phrases like \"contributing to the lively atmosphere\" and \"enhancing the urban setting.\" These statements analyze the scene's mood or composition, which goes against the instruction to describe only what is visible and its spatial framing.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While written as a single paragraph, the inclusion of subjective language and the positional contradiction make it less clear and concise than it should be. Removing the forbidden elements would improve its focus and adherence to the core task of describing spatial dynamics.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but fails on several key instructions. Its primary weaknesses are the use of subjective and interpretive language and a critical inaccuracy in describing the subjects' depth position. While it correctly identifies the types of information to include (shot size, position, movement), its execution does not fully align with the strict, objective style required by the prompt.",
