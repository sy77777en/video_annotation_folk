    "pre_caption": "The scene is framed from a central, eye-level perspective looking down a tunnel composed of concentric rings. Initially, the rings are positioned concentrically around the center of the frame, creating depth from the textured foreground rings to the smooth background rings. A small, white circle is visible in the center of the frame, positioned in the background at the end of the tunnel, while silver pentagons are embedded on the middle-ground rings. The camera then moves forward along the tunnel's central axis. This movement causes the white circle in the background to expand from the center until it fills most of the frame. Simultaneously, the concentric rings expand radially outwards, with the foreground and middle-ground elements moving past the camera and out of view, leaving the innermost ring to frame the enlarged white circle by the end of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A view of a tunnel-like structure reveals a series of nested concentric rings. The rings with a dark, metallic material and a textured diamond plate pattern, studded with small silver-colored metallic pentagons, are not the outermost ones. Closer to the center, the rings are smooth, black, and glossy. At the center of the composition is a bright, solid white circle that contrasts with the surrounding dark structure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene depicts an installation of a dark, abstract tunnel composed of multiple rotating, concentric rings. The outermost rings feature a dark grey, textured diamond plate pattern, while the inner rings are smoother and black with a slight sheen. Small, silver, pentagonal objects are embedded at intervals along some of the rings. At the center of the tunnel is a bright, white, circular void that gradually expands, framed by the innermost black ring, creating a dynamic visual experience as the viewer's perspective shifts toward the light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a highly accurate, detailed, and well-written description that masterfully adheres to the specific and complex instructions provided. It successfully translates the abstract visual motion into a clear and objective textual description.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key elements (concentric rings, white circle, silver pentagons) and their visual properties (textured vs. smooth). The description of the camera's forward movement and the resulting effect on the elements—the rings expanding radially and moving out of view while the central circle grows to fill the frame—is a precise representation of the video's content.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough and addresses all the required components of the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** While it doesn't use a formal term like \"wide shot,\" it effectively describes the initial framing as \"looking down a tunnel\" and the final state as the circle \"fill[ing] most of the frame.\" This implicitly covers the transition from a wide perspective of the tunnel's interior to an extreme close-up on the light, which fully satisfies the instruction's intent.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** The caption excels here. It clearly defines the 2D position of elements (\"center of the frame\") and their 3D depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle-ground,\" \"background\").\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly identifies the camera's position as a \"central, eye-level perspective.\"\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** The description of movement is a key strength. It clearly separates the camera's movement (\"moves forward along the tunnel's central axis\") from the apparent movement of the scene's elements (\"rings expand radially outwards,\" \"circle... to expand from the center\"), which is a sophisticated and accurate way to describe the dynamic.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption strictly follows all stylistic and content constraints:\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and objective (e.g., \"textured,\" \"smooth,\" \"silver\" are descriptive, not subjective).\n    *   It completely avoids speculation, ambiguity, and emotional language.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the specified task of describing spatial framing and dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, comprehensive, and well-structured, providing a clear and objective analysis of the video's spatial composition and movement. No improvements are necessary.",
