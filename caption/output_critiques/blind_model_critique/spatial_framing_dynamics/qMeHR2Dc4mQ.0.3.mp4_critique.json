    "pre_caption": "The video is a close-up shot of an elderly man whose face is centrally positioned in the foreground of the frame. Initially, his head is bowed with his eyes closed, causing his forehead and the upper part of his face to be the most prominent features within this central framing. He then slowly lifts his head a small amount, opening his eyes. This movement brings his eyes and more of his lower face into direct view as his gaze shifts from looking slightly upwards to a forward direction, while his face remains the central element in the foreground. The background, located behind him, is an out-of-focus, dimly lit surface. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a close-up shot of an elderly man with light skin and short, gray hair. His face is characterized by prominent wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes. He is wearing a dark green collared shirt. Initially, his eyes are closed, but he opens them, revealing light-colored eyes, and looks slightly upwards before his gaze shifts to a more direct, focused look.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a close-up of an elderly man's face in a dimly lit indoor setting. The background is out of focus, but with adjusted lighting, it reveals a plain wall in a deep, earthy tone, suggesting a simple interior. The lighting is warm and soft, casting subtle shadows on the man's features. The overall color palette is muted, dominated by earthy tones. The man's head is bowed, and he slowly lifts his gaze.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the gaze shifting \"from looking slightly upwards to a forward direction\" feels inaccurate, as lifting a bowed head would logically involve the gaze moving from a downward to a forward position; in the video, his eyes appear to be looking down while closed, and upon opening, they settle directly forward at the camera. The caption could also be more specific about the framing, which appears to be a tight close-up where the top of his head is slightly cropped out of the frame throughout the shot. The \"dark object in the lower left corner\" is not in the background but is clearly the man's own shoulder in the foreground, creating a framing element. Furthermore, the description misses the dynamic role of lighting in defining the spatial presence; a distinct key light from the upper right illuminates his forehead initially, and as he lifts his head, this light travels down, catching the bridge of his nose and right cheekbone, which is a more significant spatial event than the simple description of his face becoming more visible.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a tight close-up shot of an elderly man, with his face centrally positioned in the foreground. His head is initially bowed, eyes closed, and his gaze directed downward. As he slowly lifts his head, he opens his eyes, directing his gaze forward at the camera. The top of his head is slightly cropped out of the frame, emphasizing the close-up nature of the shot. A dark object, identified as his shoulder, is visible in the lower left corner, adding to the framing. The lighting plays a dynamic role, with a key light from the upper right initially illuminating his forehead. As he raises his head, the light travels down, highlighting the bridge of his nose and right cheekbone, enhancing the spatial presence of his face. The background remains an out-of-focus, dimly lit surface, while the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
