    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a man and a woman in the foreground, captured from their level. The man is positioned in the center-left of the frame, and the woman is to his right. In the background, a tall waterfall is centered, with a rocky stream in the foreground and middle ground at the bottom of the frame. Green foliage occupies the left side of the scene, and two other people stand in the middle ground on the right. The shot then transitions to a medium shot as the camera moves to a position above the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are positioned in the foreground. The man, holding the camera for a selfie, has dark hair and wears a light gray short-sleeved t-shirt with a chest pocket, a black face mask, and a black baseball cap with sunglasses resting on top. The woman standing next to him has blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail and is wearing a dark green tank top with a black bag strap over her shoulder and a blue face mask. She initially turns slightly toward the man, then faces the camera. In the middle ground on the right, another man stands near a small child who is wearing a blue shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A selfie POV shot captures a scene at the base of a tall, slender waterfall during the daytime. The white water cascades down a dark, textured rock face into a rocky stream below. The surrounding gorge is covered in green moss and other foliage, with bright green and yellow leaves visible at the top and left of the frame in the initial part of the video. In the foreground, a man in a grey shirt and a woman in a green tank top, both wearing face masks, are positioned for the shot. Other people are faintly visible in the shaded middle ground or background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the initial medium close-up and the positions of the main subjects and background elements. However, it lacks specificity regarding the camera movement, failing to clarify if the transition is a continuous motion, like a drone pulling up and away, or a hard cut. The description of the final framing is incomplete; while it notes the change to a medium shot from a higher angle, it neglects to describe the new spatial arrangement of the subjects and scenery. For instance, it omits that as the camera moves, the man and woman shift to the bottom-center of the frame and become part of the middle ground, with the waterfall now more centrally framed behind them. Furthermore, the final shot appears closer to a medium-long shot, as it reveals the subjects from the knees up, emphasizing their relationship to the expansive environment. The caption also misses the compositional role of the stream, which acts as a strong leading line from the foreground to the background, and it could provide more detail on the two people in the middle ground, such as them being smaller in scale and slightly out of focus, which would better establish the scene's depth.",
