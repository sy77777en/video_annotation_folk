    "pre_caption": "From a head-mounted camera perspective, the video begins with a full shot of the skier positioned in the center of the frame, with their skis and the snow directly below them in the foreground. As the skier launches from a large white ramp in the foreground, the camera's viewpoint rapidly inverts. The skier remains centered but is now upside down, with the vast blue sky filling the background. The camera continues its 360-degree rotation with the skier, causing the snowy terrain park below, which includes other ramps and distant ski lifts, to reappear at the top of the frame and move downward as the skier rights themselves for the landing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with long, dark brown hair is shown skiing from a helmet-mounted camera, providing a first-person perspective of the experience. She wears a black ski helmet, large ski goggles with reflective blue lenses, and a black neck gaiter. Her attire includes a red and grey varsity-style jacket with a white letter \"C\" on the chest and black ski pants. She uses yellow ski poles and is on red and black skis. The video captures her performing an aerial maneuver, showing her upside down against a clear blue sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, keeps the perspective fixed as a skier approaches a large jump in a snowy terrain park. The scene is set on a sunny day under a clear blue sky, with distant snow-capped mountains and ski lifts visible across the landscape. As the skier launches into the air from a large, white snow ramp, the world dramatically rotates around the fixed viewpoint, revealing the blue sky and then the ground below. The ramp, marked with an \"O'NEILL\" logo, and other snow features with \"MARKER\" and \"LIVIGNO\" branding, become visible as the perspective inverts and then rights itself before landing. The groomed white snow covers the entire area, with other people visible on the slopes in the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The height of the head-mounted camera varies as the subject performs a 360-degree flip in the air. During the motion, the camera height shifts between being at the subject, below the subject, and above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the shot size as a \"full shot of the skier,\" which is impossible from a head-mounted camera perspective; what is likely visible are the skier's skis in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, not the entire skier. The description of the snow and skis as \"background\" is also inaccurate, as they would be the most prominent foreground and middle-ground elements from this point of view. While the caption correctly identifies the inversion, it oversimplifies the dynamics; as the skier launches, their skis would likely rise from the bottom to occupy the center of the frame against the sky. Furthermore, the description of the terrain park \"reappearing at the bottom\" is imprecise. During the 360-degree rotation of a flip, the ground would first appear inverted at the top of the frame before rotating down to the bottom as the skier orients for landing. The caption also omits the likely presence of the skier's hands and poles on the left and right sides of the frame and fails to describe the final moment of landing, where the skis reconnect with the snow in the middle ground.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a head-mounted camera perspective, the video begins with a view of the skier's skis prominently in the foreground, with the snow beneath them. As the skier launches from a large white ramp, the camera's viewpoint rapidly inverts, capturing the skis rising to the center of the frame against the vast blue sky. The skier's hands and poles are visible on the sides of the frame. During the 360-degree rotation, the snowy terrain park, including other ramps and distant ski lifts, first appears inverted at the top of the frame before rotating downwards as the skier reorients for landing. The video concludes with the skier's skis reconnecting with the snow in the middle ground.",
