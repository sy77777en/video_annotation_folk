    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a static shot from inside a car trunk, facing outward toward a large frosted window that fills most of the upper center of the frame, with the camera at the subject’s height. In the foreground, a blue storage bin with various items is positioned at the bottom left, and a brown rounded object is at the bottom right. A stack of black containers sits in the center foreground, just below the window. Initially, the person’s face is faintly visible through the left side of the frosted window, placing them in the background and top left of the frame. As the trunk opens, the person’s upper body moves into a medium shot, occupying the center and left middle ground, while the blue bin and brown object remain in the lower corners. The person places a bag into the trunk, with the bag briefly appearing in the center foreground. As the trunk closes, the person’s hand is visible at the top center foreground, pushing the lid down, while the rest of their body moves out of view. Throughout, the camera remains stationary, and the spatial arrangement shifts mainly due to the trunk opening and closing, which changes the visibility and prominence of the person and their hand within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light skin and short, dark brown hair appears outside the car, initially visible only as a faint face through the left window. The person then opens the trunk, revealing more of their upper body in a medium shot. They are wearing a dark jacket and a yellow scarf, and their expression is neutral. The person places a dark-colored bag inside the trunk, then attempts to close it. As the trunk closes, only their hand, which is light-skinned and unadorned, remains visible as it pushes the trunk lid down.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors, looking toward a large frosted window that diffuses the daylight and obscures the view outside. The setting appears to be a small, enclosed space with light-colored walls and a door or window frame that is rectangular and made of metal or painted wood. On the left side, a blue plastic storage bin holds various items, including a red and white object and a brush with dark bristles. On the right, a brown, rounded object rests near the floor, and in the center, a stack of black containers or cases is visible. The lighting is soft and cool, with the natural light from outside creating a muted, subdued atmosphere. This enclosed indoor space is possibly a truck cargo bed. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video appears to be filmed from inside a car's trunk. Initially, the character's face is faintly visible through the car's left window. They then open the trunk, revealing a medium shot of themself, place a bag inside, and attempt to close the trunk. In the final frame, only their hand closing the trunk remains visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the camera being at the \"subject's height\" is inaccurate; since the camera is fixed inside the trunk looking up and out, it maintains a consistent low-angle perspective relative to the person standing outside. The description also misses the significant framing role of the trunk lid itself, which initially occupies the entire frame before lifting upward and out of view, creating a reveal of the person and the outside environment, and then returns to close off the shot. The movement of the person could be described more dynamically; instead of just moving into a medium shot, they likely lean forward from the background into the middle ground as they place the bag, a continuous motion that the caption separates into distinct events. Furthermore, the description of the \"brown rounded object\" is vague; if it is an identifiable object like a spare tire, naming it would improve precision. Finally, the bag's appearance in the \"center foreground\" could be detailed further by describing its placement in relation to the other foreground objects, for instance, if it is set down between the bin and the brown object, which would provide a more complete picture of the changing spatial composition within the trunk.",
