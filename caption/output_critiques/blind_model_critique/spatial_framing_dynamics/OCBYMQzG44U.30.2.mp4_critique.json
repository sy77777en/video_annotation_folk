    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide scenery shot, using a first-person perspective to navigate the environment. The sequence begins with a high-angle shot looking down into the entrance of a red water slide, which is positioned in the center foreground of a white-tiled room. The camera then moves forward and down, entering the slide, and the frame transitions to a tight shot from within the dark, red, tubular structure. A bright light appears in the center distance, creating depth as the camera travels toward it. The perspective emerges into a low-angle, water-level wide shot of a long, flooded hallway. The murky water occupies the foreground, with colorful pool floats scattered across the surface from the foreground to the middle ground. The hallway's white-tiled walls line the left and right sides of the frame, receding into the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a surreal indoor scenery shot, capturing a disorienting journey through a liminal space. The sequence begins in a sterile, green-lit room with white tiled walls, looking down the mouth of a vibrant red water slide. The perspective then plunges into the dark, enclosed tube of the slide, a tight, reddish-brown tunnel that opens toward a bright light. The camera emerges at water level into a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles and small, high windows. The murky green water is populated by several colorful, abandoned-looking pool floats, including a yellow, purple, cyan, and two orange rings. The video lacks a main subject, instead using the first-person perspective to immerse the viewer in the strange and unsettling atmosphere of the environment itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, begins by looking down the entrance of a red, enclosed water slide situated in a room with white tiled walls and floors. The perspective travels down the dark red, tubular slide, emerging from the end into a body of water. The view is now at water level in a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles, featuring a large ceiling light. Small windows are visible high up on the walls, and several colorful inflatable pool floats—including a yellow ring, a purple tube, and an orange animal shape—drift on the surface of the murky green water.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the sequence of events: starting at the entrance of a red water slide, moving through it, and emerging into a flooded hallway with pool floats. All described elements (white tiles, red tube, bright light, murky water, colorful floats) are present in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption covers the entire video from start to finish. It describes the initial scene, the transition through the slide, and the final scene in the hallway. It successfully captures all the key visual and spatial information required.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Spatial Framing and Dynamics:** The caption excels here. It consistently and correctly uses the specified terminology:\n        *   **Shot Size:** It identifies the \"wide scenery shot,\" \"tight shot,\" and \"wide shot\" at the appropriate moments.\n        *   **Position (2D/3D):** It precisely locates elements, such as the slide in the \"center foreground,\" the light in the \"center distance,\" the water in the \"foreground,\" the floats from \"foreground to the middle ground,\" and the walls on the \"left and right sides\" receding into the \"background.\"\n        *   **Height:** It correctly notes the initial \"high-angle shot\" and the final \"low-angle, water-level\" perspective.\n        *   **Movement/Changes:** It clearly describes the camera's movement (\"moves forward and down,\" \"travels toward it\") and the transitions between different shots and environments (\"the frame transitions to a tight shot,\" \"The perspective emerges into...\").\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is written in a single, coherent paragraph using simple, natural English. It is informative without being overly wordy.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. Words like \"murky\" and \"colorful\" are used as objective descriptors. It strictly adheres to what is visible in the video.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and technically precise in its description of the video's spatial composition and dynamics. No changes are needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video offers a comprehensive view using a first-person perspective to explore the environment. It begins with a high-angle shot looking down at the entrance of a red water slide, centrally positioned in a white-tiled room. The camera advances forward and descends into the slide, transitioning to a close-up within the dark, red tube. A bright light appears ahead, adding depth as the camera approaches it. Emerging into a low-angle, water-level wide shot, the scene reveals a long, flooded hallway. Murky water fills the foreground, with colorful pool floats scattered from the foreground to the middle ground. The hallway's white-tiled walls frame the left and right sides, extending into the background.",
