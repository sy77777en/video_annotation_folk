    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a man is positioned in the left-center of the frame, sitting in the foreground on a rocky mountaintop. A large piece of yellow and blue fabric is spread out around him, occupying the bottom-center and right foreground, while a black backpack sits in the bottom-left. The immediate foreground and middle ground consist of rocky terrain, with a cliff formation visible in the left middle ground. A vast mountain range extends across the entire background, situated beneath a cloudy sky that fills the top half of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with long, blond hair tied back and some facial stubble sits on a rocky surface. He is wearing a short-sleeved green t-shirt, dark gray shorts, and yellow and black shoes with red laces. He is focused on putting on a piece of equipment, pulling a large, bright yellow and blue fabric, which appears to be a paraglider or wingsuit, over his leg and adjusting its straps. A black backpack with the word \"Apex\" on it sits on the ground beside him.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A man with long blonde hair sits on a rocky, scree-covered mountaintop, preparing his gear. He is dressed in a green t-shirt and grey shorts and is focused on adjusting something on his leg while sitting on a large piece of yellow and blue fabric spread across the ground. The immediate area is barren and rocky, with a few patches of snow visible near a cliff edge. In the background, a vast mountain range stretches into the distance, with green valleys below and other peaks visible under a sky filled with large, white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but misses key dynamic details and could be more precise in its spatial descriptions. While the shot is correctly identified as static, the description fails to mention any movement within the frame, such as the yellow and blue fabric, likely a paraglider wing, fluttering in the wind, or the man making subtle movements like turning his head to survey the landscape. The term \"full shot\" may be imprecise if the man is sitting and his lower body is obscured by the rocky foreground; a \"medium long shot\" might be more accurate. The description of the man's position is also incomplete, as it omits his orientation; specifying that he sits in profile, facing towards the right of the frame, would add significant spatial context. Additionally, the relationship between the elements could be clearer; for example, the cliff formation in the left middle ground could be described as rising just behind the man, creating a framing element on the left side of the scene and enhancing the sense of depth.",
