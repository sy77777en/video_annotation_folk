    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a glass centered in the middle ground, with its lower portion obscured by a dark surface in the foreground. The scene is framed by two blurry, dark structures on the left and right sides of the foreground. As the shot progresses, the foreground surface moves down and out of view, revealing the entire glass and its clear reflection on the shiny surface below. The glass and its reflection remain stationary in the center of the frame, while the camera stays at the subject's level. A small text overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single, clear, colorless drinking glass is centered in the frame, standing upright on a dark, reflective surface. The glass has a tumbler-like shape, slightly tapered so that it is wider at the rim than at its thick, rounded base. Initially, the lower portion of the glass is obscured by the surface it rests on, but the full object is later revealed, along with its clear reflection on the shiny surface beneath it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, monochromatic setting, a single, transparent glass with a slightly tapered shape is centered on a highly reflective surface, creating a clear mirror image directly beneath it. At the beginning of the video, an object in the foreground partially obstructs the lower part of the glass. The background is a solid, deep black, framed by two out-of-focus dark structures on either side. The lighting is minimal and focused, highlighting the contours of the empty glass. A small, white text overlay reading \"[DE]\" is visible in the bottom-left corner.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of glassware on a conveyor belt. In the first half, the lower base of the glass is obscured by the belt, but it becomes fully visible in the latter half.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The use of \"full shot\" is slightly ambiguous for an object; \"medium shot\" might be more precise if the glass and its immediate surroundings fill the frame. The description of the \"dark surface\" is good, but it could be more specific about its texture or form—for instance, if it's a hand moving away or a piece of cloth being pulled, this action would add to the spatial dynamics. The caption successfully notes the reveal of the glass's reflection, but it misses an opportunity to describe the contents of the glass itself, such as a large, clear ice cube and a golden liquid, which are central elements of the subject. Furthermore, while the glass is described as stationary, the caption doesn't account for a potential subtle camera movement, like a very slow push-in that occurs after the foreground element is removed, which would gradually tighten the framing and shift the shot from a medium shot to a medium close-up, enhancing the focus on the subject. Finally, describing the \"blurry, dark structures\" is a good detail, but their identity, if discernible (e.g., the silhouettes of other bottles in the background), would provide a richer understanding of the scene's depth.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a glass centered in the middle ground, partially obscured by a dark surface in the foreground, which appears to be a piece of cloth being pulled away. As the cloth moves down and out of view, it reveals the entire glass, showcasing a large, clear ice cube and a golden liquid inside, along with its clear reflection on the shiny surface below. The glass and its reflection remain stationary in the center of the frame, while the camera subtly pushes in, gradually transitioning the shot to a medium close-up, enhancing the focus on the subject. The scene is framed by the silhouettes of other bottles in the background, adding depth to the composition. A small text overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner.",
