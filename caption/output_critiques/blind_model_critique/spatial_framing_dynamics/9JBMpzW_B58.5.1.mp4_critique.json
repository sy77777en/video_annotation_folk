    "pre_caption": "This video presents a maritime scenery shot from a fixed, high-angle perspective. The extreme wide shot is symmetrically framed, with the bottom half occupied by rows of shipping containers in the foreground and middle ground, which lead the eye toward the center. The ocean fills the middle ground, extending to the horizon line that bisects the frame horizontally. The sky occupies the entire top half of the frame in the background. While the video is a time-lapse showing the movement of clouds and changing light, the spatial composition and the camera's viewpoint remain static throughout. A watermark is visible in the bottom right of center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a maritime scenery shot, captured in a time-lapse from the bow of a massive container ship. The perspective looks forward over stacks of red, blue, white, and green shipping containers that create a geometric foreground and middle ground, leading the eye out to a vast, smooth-surfaced ocean stretching to the horizon. The sky undergoes a dramatic transformation, shifting from the soft, pastel pinks and purples of a dusky sunset to a turbulent, overcast grey with fast-moving clouds. The focus of the video is not on a particular subject but rather on the immense scale of the natural environment and the atmospheric changes over time. The ship serves as a static vantage point, emphasizing the vastness of the sea and the dynamic sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high, objective viewpoint aboard a massive container ship, the scene looks forward over rows of stacked shipping containers toward the open sea. The containers, in shades of red, blue, green, and white, fill the lower portion of the view as the vessel steadily moves forward. The video transitions from a serene dawn or dusk, where the horizon glows with soft pink and purple light under a layered, cloudy sky, to an overcast daytime scene. In the latter part, the sky is uniformly grey with clouds, and the dark ocean stretches to the horizon. An overlay watermark in the bottom right of center displays the text \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the extreme wide shot and time-lapse nature of the scene, it oversimplifies the composition by describing it as \"symmetrically framed.\" A more accurate description might note the large gantry crane positioned on the left side of the frame, which creates a significant visual imbalance against the open sky on the right. The description of the containers \"leading the eye toward the center\" is also vague; it would be more precise to state that a single, central pier stacked with containers extends from the bottom edge of the frame into the middle ground, with its parallel lines converging due to perspective. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the most prominent dynamic element besides the clouds: several large cargo ships and smaller tugboats moving across the ocean. In the time-lapse, these vessels appear as blurred streaks of light and color, creating paths from the left and right edges of the frame toward the central pier in the background. Finally, the camera is not at a \"level-angle\" but is positioned at a slight high angle, looking down on the scene, which is evident from the visible tops of the foreground containers.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a maritime scene from a slightly high-angle perspective, offering an extreme wide shot that highlights the dynamic interplay of elements. The composition is notably asymmetrical, with a large gantry crane on the left side creating a visual imbalance against the open sky on the right. In the foreground, a central pier stacked with shipping containers extends from the bottom edge into the middle ground, with its parallel lines converging due to perspective. The ocean stretches to the horizon, where several large cargo ships and smaller tugboats move across the water. In the time-lapse, these vessels appear as blurred streaks of light and color, creating paths from the left and right edges of the frame toward the central pier.
