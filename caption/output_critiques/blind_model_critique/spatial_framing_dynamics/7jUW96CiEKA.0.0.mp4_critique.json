    "pre_caption": "This is a medium shot focusing on a large, leafless tree, viewed from a low angle looking upwards. The thick trunk occupies the bottom right foreground and extends towards the center. Numerous bare branches spread out from the trunk, filling the center, top left, and top right portions of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The clear blue sky serves as the background, visible between the intricate network of branches, particularly in the top left and top center. A point of bright sunlight creates a lens flare near a branch in the top left middle ground. The framing remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a large, leafless tree with a thick, textured trunk and numerous sprawling branches extending outward. The bark is rough and gray, with visible patterns and knots. The branches are bare, showcasing a network of smaller twigs against the sky. The tree's imposing structure and intricate details are highlighted, emphasizing its size and natural complexity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene featuring a large, leafless tree with thick, textured branches extending outward against a clear blue sky. The tree's bark is rough and gray, with distinctive markings and a robust trunk. Sunlight filters through the branches, creating lens flares and subtle shadows on the tree's surface. The setting is serene and natural, with no visible human-made structures or movement, emphasizing the tree's grandeur and the open sky. The time of day appears to be midday, as indicated by the bright, direct sunlight illuminating the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene's elements and their spatial relationships. The identification of the trunk in the \"bottom right foreground,\" the branches in the \"foreground and middle ground,\" and the sky as the \"background\" is precise. The description of the camera's perspective as a \"low angle looking upwards\" is also correct. The only point of potential inaccuracy is the term \"medium shot.\" In standard cinematography, a medium shot typically frames a human subject from the waist up. For a large, non-human subject like a tree, this term can be ambiguous. A \"wide shot\" or \"medium-long shot\" might be more appropriate, as the frame captures a significant portion of the tree and its environment. However, the rest of the description is so detailed that it clarifies what is visible, mitigating the ambiguity of the shot size term.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and successfully covers all the required aspects from the instructions. It details the shot size, the 2D position (bottom right, center, top left), the 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and the camera's height/angle (low angle). It also correctly notes the absence of movement by stating, \"The framing remains static.\" It even includes and correctly places a minor detail like the lens flare, demonstrating a thorough analysis of the visual information.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the given instructions.\n*   It provides a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"majestic\").\n*   It avoids speculative language (\"appears to be,\" \"might be\").\n*   It focuses strictly on the spatial framing and dynamics, precisely describing the position, depth, and relative height of all key elements as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a well-written, detailed, and objective description that perfectly aligns with the provided instructions. The only minor area for improvement would be to use a more conventional term for the shot size when describing a large object like a tree.",
