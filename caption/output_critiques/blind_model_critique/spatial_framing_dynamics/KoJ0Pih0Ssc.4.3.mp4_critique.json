    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a low-angle close-up, where a spiked metal grid occupies the foreground, stretching from the bottom of the frame into the middle ground. A tall concrete wall runs along the right side, and anti-tank obstacles are positioned in the background on the left. The camera then pulls back and tilts upward, transitioning to a wider shot. In the final frame, the spiked grid is in the bottom right foreground, while a chain-link fence extends from the left foreground into the distance. The anti-tank obstacles are now in the middle ground, left of center, with a guard tower and city buildings visible in the background. The shot settles on a low-angle perspective looking up toward the sky, as a text overlay reading \"SIGNAL FENCE\" appears in the lower center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a heavily fortified border area, beginning with a close-up of a long, rectangular metal grid laid on reddish-brown, sandy ground. Numerous sharp, nail-like spikes protrude vertically from this grid. To the right is a tall, grey concrete wall featuring large grid-like lines running across it. As the perspective widens, the full extent of the fortifications is revealed, including a line of dark, metallic, X-shaped Czech hedgehog anti-tank obstacles beyond the chain-link fence with metal posts, which is identified by the on-screen text \"SIGNAL FENCE\" in a blue box. In the distant background, a guard tower and several multi-story urban buildings are visible under a bright, cloudy sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This outdoor daytime scene is set along a high, grey concrete wall on sandy ground. In the foreground, a long strip of wire mesh with upward-pointing spikes is laid on the ground. Parallel to this, a line of dark, metallic Czech hedgehog obstacles and a chain-link fence extend into the distance, where city buildings and a guard tower are visible under a bright, partly cloudy sky. As the view tilts upward, a blue rectangular overlay with the white text \"SIGNAL FENCE\" appears in the lower portion of the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video transitions from a close-up of a grid-like structure with spikes on the ground to a wider shot revealing a fenced-off area labeled \"Signal Fence,\" set against an urban backdrop with buildings and a clear sky.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its spatial description. It correctly identifies the initial shot as a \"low-angle close-up\" and the final shot as a \"wider shot\" from a \"low-angle perspective.\" The description of the camera movement—\"pulls back and tilts upward\"—precisely explains how the framing changes. The placement of all elements (spiked grid, wall, obstacles, fence, tower) is described correctly in both the initial and final compositions.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It successfully covers all the required aspects:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It clearly states the initial \"close-up\" and the transition to a \"wider shot.\"\n    *   **Position:** It provides both the 2D (e.g., \"bottom right,\" \"left of center\") and 3D (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") positions for all key elements.\n    *   **Depth:** It effectively conveys depth by using terms like \"foreground,\" \"background,\" and \"extends... into the distance.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly identifies the \"low-angle\" perspective at both the beginning and end.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It explicitly describes the camera movement (\"pulls back and tilts upward\") and how this movement reframes the scene's elements, including the appearance of the text overlay.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption strictly follows all stylistic and content rules:\n    *   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or subjective adjectives.\n    *   It avoids speculation and ambiguity, describing only what is visible.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the \"spatial framing and dynamics\" as requested.",
