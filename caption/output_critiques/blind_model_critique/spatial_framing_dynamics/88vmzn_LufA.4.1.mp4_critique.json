    "pre_caption": "A full shot of a black Cadillac limousine is presented in the center of the frame and the middle ground, angled towards the left against a solid gray background. The camera smoothly pans from left to right, arcing around the vehicle. This movement transitions the view from a front three-quarter perspective to a side profile, and finally to a rear three-quarter perspective, showcasing the car's full length. Throughout the pan, the limousine remains centered in the frame and in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a black Cadillac presidential limousine from multiple angles against a neutral gray background. The long, armored vehicle has a glossy black body and features the American flag on the front passenger-side fender and the blue Presidential Seal flag on the driver-side fender. A circular Presidential Seal emblem is also present on the rear passenger door. The car is equipped with large, multi-spoke silver wheels, a prominent front grille with the Cadillac crest, and two antennas on the rear of the roof. The view pans around the vehicle, revealing its full length and the design of its rear, which includes vertical taillights and another Cadillac crest on the trunk.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a studio setting with a solid dark gray background, a long, black armored limousine is showcased. The glossy vehicle, a modern Cadillac design, features tinted windows, large silver multi-spoke wheels, and two flags mounted on the front fenders: the American flag and a blue presidential flag. A circular seal is also present on the rear passenger door. The perspective smoothly arcs around the car, starting from a front three-quarter view and moving to reveal its side and rear profiles. At the beginning of the video, an overlay of blue text on a white background briefly appears, displaying 'CADILLAC \"THE BEAST\"'.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the camera's counterclockwise arc and the resulting change in the car's perspective. However, the statement that the limousine \"moves into the foreground\" as the camera circles to the rear is likely inaccurate. In a smooth arcing shot where the camera maintains a consistent distance, the subject would remain in the same plane of depth—likely the middle ground—throughout the entire movement, not transition from middle ground to foreground. A more precise description would state that the car remains in the middle ground while the camera orbits it. Additionally, the description of a \"solid gray background\" is too simplistic; the video likely shows a glossy, reflective floor beneath the limousine, which mirrors parts of the vehicle and adds depth to the scene. Finally, while the camera might be at the subject's level, it's more probable that it is positioned at a slightly low angle, looking up at the limousine to give it a more imposing and prominent presence in the frame.",
