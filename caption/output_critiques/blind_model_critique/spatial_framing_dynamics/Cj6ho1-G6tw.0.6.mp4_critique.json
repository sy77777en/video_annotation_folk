    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a high-angle wide shot, featuring a distant cityscape in the background and a large stone parapet dominating the foreground. A bicycle wheel enters from the bottom right foreground, followed by a man on a bicycle who rides along the top of the parapet, moving from the right side of the frame toward the center. Initially, the camera is positioned at the subject's height on the foreground railing. The man then leaps off the railing, dropping into the middle ground onto a grassy slope below. As he descends, the camera's perspective becomes high-angle, looking down on the subject, who is now smaller in the frame and positioned in the center as he moves down the slope.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man wearing a red t-shirt, black pants, black and red gloves, and a blue, white, and yellow helmet appears riding an orange bicycle. The bike's wheels are black with a green and white stripe on the rims. The man jumps his bicycle onto a wide stone railing and then leaps off it, landing on a grassy slope below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high vantage point atop a wide, wet stone parapet, a sprawling city is visible under a uniformly grey and overcast sky. The ancient-looking stone wall in the foreground is dark and damp, overlooking a steep, green grassy embankment that descends to a lower elevation. The city in the background is a dense collection of buildings situated next to a green area with trees. A person on an orange bicycle with green-rimmed wheels rides along the top of the stone wall before descending the grassy slope.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video is filmed from a high vantage point on a building. The background features a distant cityscape, while the foreground includes parts of the building. As the camera ascends, a man in orange enters from the bottom right, riding a bicycle. He jumps onto a stone railing and then lands on the grass below.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera height relative to the subject shifts to at the subject, then transitions to above the subject as they move downward.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly follows the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the spatial elements and their dynamics.\n*   It correctly identifies the initial framing as a \"high-angle wide shot\" (relative to the overall scene) while also accurately noting that the camera is \"at the subject's height\" (relative to the man on the foreground parapet). This is a sophisticated and correct distinction, not a contradiction.\n*   The description of the subject's movement from the right foreground toward the center, and then dropping into the middle ground, is precise.\n*   The change in camera perspective to a more pronounced high-angle as the subject descends is also accurately captured.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete and addresses all the required components of the instructions.\n*   **Shot Size:** It specifies the \"wide shot\" and implies the subject becoming smaller, which indicates a change to a longer shot.\n*   **Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively uses terms like \"background,\" \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"bottom right,\" \"right side,\" and \"center\" to map out the scene.\n*   **Depth & Height:** It clearly describes the subject's movement through different depth planes (foreground to middle ground) and the corresponding change in the camera's relative height (from subject's height to high-angle).\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The description of the man riding, leaping, and descending, along with the shift in camera perspective, is detailed and thorough.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption successfully creates a concise, single-paragraph description using simple, natural English.\n*   It strictly avoids emotional adjectives, subjective language, and speculative statements.\n*   It focuses entirely on the visible spatial framing and dynamics as instructed, providing a clear and objective analysis of the shot.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and adheres to all stylistic and content requirements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot showcasing a distant cityscape in the background and a prominent stone parapet in the foreground. A bicycle wheel appears from the bottom right, followed by a man riding a bicycle along the top of the parapet, moving from the right side toward the center of the frame. Initially, the camera is aligned with the man's height on the foreground railing. The man then jumps off the railing, landing on a grassy slope in the middle ground. As he descends, the camera shifts to a high-angle view, looking down on the now smaller figure centered in the frame as he moves down the slope.",
