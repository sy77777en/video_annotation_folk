    "pre_caption": "In a wide, high-angle shot, a small figure in a yellow raincoat is initially positioned in the center-middle ground. A large, black, amorphous shape occupies the left foreground, while several smaller black shapes are scattered on the floor in the middle ground around the figure. The figure runs from the center toward the right side of the frame, staying in the middle ground. The light it carries moves with it, illuminating a wet patch in the center and briefly revealing a can-like object in the bottom right middle ground as it moves past. The camera remains static throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark environment, a small, child-like figure is illuminated by a light source it appears to hold. The figure is clad in a bright yellow raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that completely obscures its face and head. Scattered on the floor around this figure are several black, amorphous shapes that resemble puddles of a thick, dark liquid or small, shadowy creatures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person 3D game video captures a small figure in a bright yellow raincoat running through a pitch-black indoor space. The figure is the sole source of light, casting a moving circle of illumination onto a dark, planked floor. This light reveals wet patches and amorphous dark shapes on the ground, while the rest of the environment remains in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"wide, high-angle shot\" and precisely maps out the spatial arrangement. The initial position of the figure (\"center-middle ground\"), the placement of the large shape (\"left foreground\"), and the scattered smaller shapes (\"middle ground\") are all correct. The description of the figure's movement (\"runs from the center toward the right side... staying in the middle ground\") is also a precise account of the action.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive and covers all required elements. It begins with the shot size and camera height, describes the 2D and 3D positions of the main subject and key environmental elements, details the subject's movement, and notes the static camera. It even includes finer details, like the moving light revealing a wet patch and a \"can-like object,\" which adds to the richness of the spatial description without becoming speculative.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective English. Terms like \"amorphous shape\" and \"can-like object\" are descriptive of form without being speculative or emotional.\n    *   **Focus:** The entire caption is dedicated to describing spatial framing and dynamics, successfully avoiding narrative interpretation or emotional language.\n    *   **Constraints:** It correctly avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and provides a definitive description of what is visible.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of following the instructions. It is clear, detailed, and strictly focused on the spatial and dynamic aspects of the scene.",
