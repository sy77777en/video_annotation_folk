    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot, the camera positioned at the subjects' level, showing four figures from behind in the middle ground. A tall man stands in the center, flanked by a blonde woman to his left and two other figures to his right. A red, U-shaped neon structure is visible in the center background. The camera then shifts to an overhead position, looking down on the subjects as they appear to descend. Concurrently, the U-shaped neon structure in the background vanishes, and the surroundings darken, with faint, thin, vertical red lines becoming visible at the top of the frame, while the figures remain centrally positioned in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows four figures standing from behind in a dark environment dominated by intense red lighting originating from the front. The main subject is a tall man positioned centrally, wearing a dark coat and facing away from the viewer. To his left stands a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a white and dark suit featuring a distinct symbol on the back. To the right of the central man are two other figures, also facing away: one with dark, voluminous hair and another wearing a dark hooded jacket with short dark hair. All figures are silhouetted against the red light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, bathed in a strong red light, possibly inside an elevator. In the background, a prominent, glowing red, U-shaped neon structure, resembling a spider icon, illuminates the space. Silhouettes of four figures are visible, facing away from the viewer towards this light. As the video progresses, the figures appear to descend, the spider-like icon disappears, and the surroundings become dark, with some faint, thin, vertical red lines visible in the darkness above them.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the initial subject placement is confusing; stating a woman is to the man's right and then that \"two other figures\" are also to his right makes it unclear if there are two or three people on that side. A more precise description, such as \"flanked by a blonde woman to his left and two figures to his right,\" would resolve this. The description of the woman with short hair being in the \"foreground\" is also spatially odd if the group is standing together; it would be more accurate to say she is positioned slightly closer to the camera. The phrase \"possibly symbolizing a spider icon\" is speculative and should be omitted. The transition could be described more dynamically; instead of the camera \"shifting,\" a more vivid description would be \"the camera cranes up and tilts down,\" and rather than the subjects \"appearing to descend,\" it would be clearer to state they \"are lowered.\" Finally, in the overhead shot, calling the subjects \"middle ground\" is spatially inaccurate; it is better to describe them as being \"centrally framed as they move further from the camera,\" and specifying how the neon structure vanishes (e.g., \"it abruptly turns off\") would add valuable detail.",
