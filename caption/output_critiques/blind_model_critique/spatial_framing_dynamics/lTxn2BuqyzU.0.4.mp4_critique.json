    "pre_caption": "This abstract video opens with a central, vertical, curving red tube. A small, dark, teardrop-shaped object is positioned on the upper-right side of this tube and moves downwards. The scene then cuts to a wider view of a red, cavernous space, where a pool of yellow liquid fills the bottom of the frame. An unseen object strikes the liquid from the top center, causing several light-yellow fragments to splash upwards into the middle of the frame before they descend back into the pool. The camera remains stationary and at a straight-on angle in both views.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This animated video presents an abstract depiction of a process within a red, organic-looking environment. A small, dark brown, teardrop-shaped object is shown moving through a smooth, curving red tube. The scene then shifts to the interior of a larger, cavernous red space, which contains a pool of opaque, yellowish-tan liquid at the bottom. Initially, the surface of the liquid is undisturbed. The teardrop-shaped object strikes the liquid, causing droplets to splash upwards, forming several small, light-yellow fragments, including two crescent shapes and a tiny dot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, animated environment with deep red, curved, and organic walls, a small, dark, teardrop-shaped object moves down a narrow, vertical passage. The scene then shifts to a wider, cavernous space, where the bottom is filled with a pool of a textured, yellowish substance. As the teardrop-shaped object strikes the pool, it creates several small, light-yellow, crescent-shaped splashes that settle into the yellow pool below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the sequence of events, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and transitions. The initial description of the teardrop object being \"on the upper-right side of this tube\" is ambiguous; it's unclear if the object is adjacent to the tube in the 2D frame or physically resting on its surface in the 3D space. The most significant issue is the spatial discontinuity between the two shots. The object is descending from the \"upper-right\" in the first shot, but after the cut, it strikes from the \"top center.\" The caption doesn't account for this change in trajectory, which feels like a jump in the action. A more accurate description might note that the object's path curves toward the center before the cut, or that the framing shifts to recenter the object after the cut. Additionally, specifying the initial shot size, such as a \"close-up,\" would provide a clearer reference point for the subsequent \"wider view.\" Finally, the description of the second scene could better establish depth by placing the cavern walls in the background, the splash in the middle ground, and the pool occupying the foreground at the bottom of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up of a central, vertical, curving red tube. A small, dark, teardrop-shaped object appears adjacent to the tube in the upper-right area of the frame, moving downward. As the object descends, its path curves toward the center. The scene then transitions to a wider view, revealing a red, cavernous space. In this shot, the cavern walls form the background, while a pool of yellow liquid occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The object, now striking from the top center, hits the liquid, causing several light-yellow fragments to splash upwards into the middle ground before descending back into the pool. The camera remains stationary and at a straight-on angle in both views.",
