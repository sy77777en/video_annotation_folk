    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a person stands in the center of the frame and in the middle ground of a dark forest at night. The individual is framed by two prominent trees in the foreground, positioned on the left and right sides of the screen. Additional trees are visible in the middle ground with the person, while the ground in the foreground and middle ground is covered in leaves and tangled branches. The background is completely dark. The camera remains stationary at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark forest at night, a person stands still between several trees. The individual wears a white cap, a light-colored hooded jacket with a dark blue hood, and dark pants. They are seen from behind, facing away from the viewer and looking deeper into the woods.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a scene unfolds within a dark forest. The ground is covered with a thick layer of leaves and fallen, tangled branches. Several tall, slender trees with light-colored bark are visible from the foreground to the background. In a dimly lit central area, a person wearing a light-colored hooded jacket and dark pants stands still with their back to the viewer. The surrounding woods are enveloped in complete darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the basic composition, noting the full shot and the person's central position in the middle ground, framed by foreground trees. However, it misses several key spatial dynamics. It fails to mention the camera's low angle, which makes the person and trees appear more imposing. The description of the person is incomplete; it should specify that they are initially facing away from the camera and then slowly turn their head to the right, a crucial movement that reorients their relationship with the viewer and the space. Furthermore, the caption omits the subtle, slow push-in of the camera, which gradually tightens the frame and increases focus on the subject. Finally, while it mentions the darkness, it doesn't describe the single, harsh light source originating from the front-left, which is essential for defining the scene's depth by casting long shadows and selectively illuminating the person and surrounding trees.",

They are framed by two prominent trees in the foreground, positioned on the left and right sides of the screen.
