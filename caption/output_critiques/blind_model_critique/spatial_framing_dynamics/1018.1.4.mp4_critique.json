    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of two men in a compact kitchen area on a train, with the camera positioned at their eye level. Initially, the main subject, a man in a white shirt, dark vest, and green cap, stands in the foreground on the right side of the frame. The secondary subject, a man in a dark suit and Santa hat holding a bag and an umbrella, is positioned slightly behind and to the left. As the video progresses, the main subject moves closer to the center of the frame while taking the umbrella from the secondary subject, who then turns away and exits towards the left background. The kitchen setting remains consistent throughout, with muted green walls, metal cabinets, and a window on the right side allowing natural light to enter. The countertop with kitchen items occupies the middle ground, maintaining its position relative to the subjects. The camera captures the interaction without noticeable changes in angle or zoom, focusing on the exchange between the two men.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two men in a room. The main subject is a man wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark vest with gold buttons, and a green cap with red text. He has a mustache, and is wearing a watch on his left hand. The secondary subject is a man in a dark suit with a white shirt and tie, wearing a red Santa hat. He holds a large bag and an umbrella. The main subject then takes the umbrella from him. The two men are positioned close to each other, with the main subject in the foreground and the secondary subject slightly behind him. The interaction suggests a dynamic between them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a compact, utilitarian kitchen area on a train, with muted green walls and metal cabinets. Natural daylight streams in through a window on the right side, indicating it is daytime, and the subtle changes in lighting suggest the train is in motion. The environment includes a countertop with various kitchen items like plates and a kettle, indicating a functional space. The scene features two individuals, one wearing a Santa hat, adding a festive touch. The other person is dressed in a uniform with a vest and tie, suggesting a formal or professional context. The overall atmosphere is calm, with no visible movement or changes in the setting aside from the gentle motion of the train.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed instructions. It successfully translates the visual information into a concise, objective description of spatial framing and dynamics.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **High Accuracy:** The caption accurately identifies the shot size as a **medium shot**, the camera height as **eye level**, and the initial and final positions of the subjects.\n*   **Correct Spatial Terms:** It correctly uses terms like \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"right side,\" \"left,\" and \"center\" to describe both the 2D and 3D placement of the subjects and background elements.\n*   **Movement Description:** The description of the main subject moving toward the center and the secondary subject exiting to the left background is precise and captures the core dynamic of the scene.\n*   **Minor Point of Inference:** The phrase \"on a train\" is an interpretation of the setting. While the compact space and window might strongly suggest a train, the instruction is to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" A stricter adherence would describe it as a \"compact kitchen\" without specifying the vehicle, unless the vehicle type is explicitly visible. However, this is a very minor point in an otherwise highly accurate description.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions: shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and spatial changes.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly identifies a main and secondary subject, detailing the main subject's actions more centrally while still fully describing the secondary subject's spatial journey.\n*   **Background Elements:** It effectively includes key background elements (kitchen, countertop, window) and situates them spatially (\"middle ground,\" \"right side\"), adding depth to the description without losing focus on the subjects.\n*   **Camera Dynamics:** It explicitly notes the lack of camera movement (\"without noticeable changes in angle or zoom\"), which is a crucial part of describing the shot's dynamics.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The caption follows the logical structure requested: it begins with the overall shot size and camera height, describes the initial static composition, and then details the movements and changes. This creates a clear and easy-to-follow narrative of the scene's spatial properties.\n*   **Language and Tone:** The language is simple, natural, and objective, perfectly aligning with the instructions. It avoids emotional adjectives (\"happy,\" \"sad\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems,\" \"perhaps\").\n*   **Conciseness:** Despite including a high level of detail, the paragraph remains concise and coherent. It highlights the most essential spatial information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a model caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. Its description of spatial relationships and movements is clear, detailed, and objective. The only potential improvement would be to slightly reduce inference (like \"on a train\") to adhere with absolute strictness to the \"describe only what is visible\" rule.",
