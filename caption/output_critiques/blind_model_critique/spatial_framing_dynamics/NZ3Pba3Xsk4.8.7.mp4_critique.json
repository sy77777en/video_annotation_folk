    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot, capturing the entire zoo enclosure and its surroundings. Several deer are distributed across the frame: one deer stands near the bottom center in the foreground, facing the camera, while other deer are positioned in the middle ground and background, with some near the left and right edges and others partially obscured by the shelter structure at the center. The shelter, made of metal bars and a flat roof, occupies the central middle ground, with a rocky wall and two rectangular doorways in the background, spanning the width of the frame. Trees with dense green foliage extend from the top left to the top right, casting shade over the scene. The camera is positioned at approximately the same height as the deer, providing a level perspective across the enclosure. There are no significant movements or changes in shot size or spatial arrangement during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows several deer with slender bodies, light brown fur, and white markings on their backs and tails. Some of the deer have short, straight antlers, while others do not, suggesting a mix of males and females. The deer are standing or walking in different areas, with one deer facing forward in the lower right corner and others positioned farther back or to the sides. The group appears calm and alert, with their heads raised and ears pointed forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor zoo enclosure surrounded by lush green trees with dense foliage, casting dappled shade over the sandy ground. The enclosure is bordered by metal railings and fencing, with a simple shelter structure made of metal bars and a flat roof at the center. Behind the shelter, a rocky wall with dark, uneven surfaces and two rectangular doorways is visible, suggesting access points for animals or staff. Scattered branches and logs lie on the ground, adding texture to the otherwise smooth, light brown sand. Several deer with light brown coats and white markings are present within the enclosure, some standing near the shelter and others positioned in the middle ground. The overall scene is bright, indicating daytime with clear weather, and no overlays or digital elements are present.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all instructions, providing a description that is accurate, complete, and exceptionally well-structured.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as an \"extreme wide shot\" and precisely maps out the spatial relationships between the subjects (deer) and key environmental elements (shelter, wall, trees). The details about the camera height and the static nature of the scene are also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully addresses every component required by the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Clearly stated at the beginning.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It excels here, providing both the 2D position within the frame (e.g., \"bottom center,\" \"left and right edges\") and the 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for multiple elements.\n    *   **Camera Height:** Correctly identified as being at a level perspective with the subjects.\n    *   **Movement/Changes:** It explicitly and correctly notes the absence of any significant movement or changes in framing.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions flawlessly.\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph as requested.\n    *   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding any emotional, subjective, or speculative words.\n    *   **Focus:** It maintains a strict focus on spatial framing and dynamics, describing *where* things are rather than *what* they are doing in a narrative sense.\n    *   **Formatting:** It avoids Markdown and introductory text.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is concise, informative, and technically precise. No improvements are needed.",
