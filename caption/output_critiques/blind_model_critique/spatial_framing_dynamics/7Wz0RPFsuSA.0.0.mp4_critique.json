    "pre_caption": "In a medium full shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. Behind her, a large, circular, silver light reflector dominates the center background. A white-painted brick wall is visible in the background, primarily on the right side and partially on the left. Initially, the woman faces mostly forward, slightly angled to her right (camera's left), looking towards the viewer. She then slowly rotates her upper body counterclockwise, turning away from the camera, until her back is mostly facing the viewer, still positioned in the center of the frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with shoulder-length blonde hair stands in front of a very large, circular, silver, multi-panelled light reflector. She wears a light-colored trench coat with dark buttons and a matching belt that is the same color as the coat. The collar of the coat is turned up, matching the dark color of the buttons, and reveals light-colored lettering that spells \"TRENCH\" on the inside. Initially, she is facing the camera, but then she gradually turns her entire body away from the viewer, rotating counterclockwise, while holding her hands near her collar.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, likely a photo studio, with a white-painted brick wall visible in the background. Dominating the backdrop is a very large, silver, multi-panelled, circular light reflector, possibly a parabolic umbrella, which is brightly illuminated from behind. A person wearing a light-colored trench coat with a dark collar stands in front of the reflector, initially facing slightly to the side and then turning their back more towards the camera. The collar of the trench coat has white lettering.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's use of \"medium full shot\" might be inaccurate; a \"medium shot\" seems more likely, as framing the woman from the waist up would better emphasize the rotation of her torso and shoulders. Describing the woman as being in the \"foreground\" is also questionable; she appears to be in the middle ground, with empty space between her and the camera constituting the foreground, which creates more depth. The \"large, circular, silver light reflector\" is more specifically a ring light, identifiable by the distinct circular illumination and the camera lens potentially visible through its center, and the term \"dominates\" is subjective. The description could also be improved by mentioning the studio floor visible beneath the subject. Furthermore, the final state of the woman's rotation is described as \"her back is mostly facing the viewer,\" which is vague; it would be more precise to state that \"her back is turned fully to the camera\" if her face is no longer visible. Lastly, specifying the camera height as \"eye-level\" would be more descriptive than the general \"subject's level.\"",
