    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot. The historic walled city, composed of densely packed buildings, dominates the frame, extending from the bottom left, through the center, to the top left, all situated in the middle ground. Grey stone fortifications surround this city, visible in the foreground and middle ground, with a notable cylindrical tower positioned in the bottom center foreground. The deep blue sea is located in the top right background. A red structure stands in the bottom right middle ground, near green vegetated areas. Roads with vehicles are present in the bottom left and bottom right, spanning the foreground and middle ground. The camera is positioned high above, providing an aerial view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an aerial cityscape scenery shot. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the expansive scale and architectural character of the historic walled city, emphasizing the overall environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object or individual.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A drone-captured video provides an aerial view of the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, during daylight. This outdoor scene showcases a dense cluster of buildings with orange terracotta tiled roofs, surrounded by light-colored stone or stucco walls, all enclosed by imposing grey stone fortifications. A notable cylindrical stone tower is part of these defenses. The city is bordered on one side by the deep blue waters of the Adriatic Sea. Green vegetation is visible both outside and inside the city walls, including some courtyards. In the lower right, a prominent red structure is situated near a green area. A watermark is overlaid in the top left corner, though its exact text is unclear.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main elements and the aerial perspective, it incorrectly portrays the scene as static. In the video, the camera performs a slow, continuous pan from left to right, causing the cylindrical tower to begin in the bottom right and gradually shift toward the bottom center of the frame. This movement also reveals more of the deep blue sea, which initially occupies the top right but expands to fill the entire top third of the frame by the end of the shot. The caption completely omits the motion of the vehicles, which are clearly visible driving along the roads in the foreground. Furthermore, the description of the city's position is slightly inaccurate; it occupies the left and center of the frame but does not extend into the top left corner, which is filled by the sea. The caption also misses the presence of several small, white boats moving across the water in the background, leaving visible wakes behind them.",
