    "pre_caption": "An extreme close-up shot frames the lower half of a man's face in profile, positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. The collar of his shirt is visible at the bottom left, also in the foreground. A plain wall occupies the right side of the frame in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the framing remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up profile view shows the lower half of a middle-aged, light-skinned man's face. He has graying stubble on his chin and jawline. The collar of a dark, possibly blue or green, shirt is visible at the bottom of the shot. His mouth is closed, and his expression is neutral.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a tight, profile close-up, the lower half of a man's face is shown against a plain, light greenish-blue wall. His mouth is closed, and his jaw and chin are covered with short stubble. The collar of a dark blue shirt is visible at the bottom of the shot. The lighting is soft and even, and the background is slightly out of focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and his general position, it could be more precise in its spatial description. The term \"extreme close-up\" feels inaccurate; \"close-up\" is more fitting as the frame includes the entire lower half of the face from the nose down, not just a single feature. The description of the face as \"in profile\" is also a simplification, as the video shows a three-quarter view, which adds more volume and depth to the subject. A crucial missing detail is the shallow depth of field, which renders the background wall completely out of focus, creating a stark separation between the sharp foreground subject and the blurred background. Furthermore, the caption overlooks the subject's own subtle movements—a slight clenching of the jaw and parting of the lips—which are key dynamic elements within the static frame. Finally, describing the wall as \"plain\" misses the soft shadow the man casts upon it, a detail that helps define the spatial relationship between the subject and his environment.",

The background features a wall that is completely out of focus due to a shallow depth of field, creating a stark separation from the sharp foreground subject. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and while the framing remains static, the man exhibits subtle movements, such as a slight clenching of the jaw and parting of the lips. A soft shadow cast by the man adds depth to the plain wall, enhancing the spatial relationship between the subject and his environment.",
