    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium-full shot of a red figure standing in the middle ground, positioned slightly left of center on a tiled floor against a black background. A large, out-of-focus purple figure occupies the foreground on the right side of the frame. The camera then moves backward as the focus racks from the red figure to the purple one. This transition brings the waist and hip area of the purple figure into sharp focus in the foreground on the right, revealing a small, glowing red sphere tucked into its side. Consequently, the red figure in the middle ground becomes blurred. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, rendered entirely in a grainy, bright red texture, stands in the middle ground. He is wearing a long, military-style coat with a high collar and a peaked cap, and his hands are on his hips. In the foreground, the waist and hip area of a second figure is visible, rendered in a similar grainy texture but in a deep blue hue. As the focus shifts from the red man to the blue figure, a small, glowing red sphere, resembling a hand grenade, becomes visible tucked into the blue figure's side.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dark, undefined space with a tiled floor against a solid black background. A figure in a military-style uniform, rendered entirely in a grainy red texture, stands in the distance. In the foreground, a large, translucent figure with a grainy blue and purple texture is positioned. The focus shifts from the red figure to the one in the foreground, revealing a glowing red, spherical object visible inside the blue figure's hip. The only text visible in the video is \"[36,37,38],\" located at the bottom left of the frame.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: A backward-moving video set against a dark background, with a rack focus shifting from a medium-full shot of a red figure in a military coat in the middle ground to the waist region of a purple figure in the foreground.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the two main figures, their colors, and their initial states of focus. It precisely describes the key dynamic actions: the camera moving backward and the focus racking from the middle ground subject to the foreground subject. The description of the final state, including the newly revealed \"glowing red sphere,\" is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is exceptionally complete and covers all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial \"medium-full shot\" and effectively describes the final framing by focusing on the \"waist and hip area.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D and 3D):** It successfully maps out the scene, placing the red figure \"slightly left of center\" (2D) in the \"middle ground\" (3D) and the purple figure on the \"right side\" (2D) in the \"foreground\" (3D).\n*   **Depth and Focus:** It expertly handles the concept of depth by describing the focus change in detail, using terms like \"out-of-focus,\" \"focus racks,\" \"sharp focus,\" and \"becomes blurred.\"\n*   **Camera Height:** It includes the camera's height relative to the subjects (\"at the subjects' level\").\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The description of the camera movement and focus rack clearly explains the transition from the initial to the final framing, fulfilling the core requirement to describe spatial dynamics.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption perfectly adheres to all stylistic and content-related rules:\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   The language is simple, natural, and strictly objective, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n*   It follows the requested structure by starting with the shot size and then detailing the spatial composition and its changes.\n*   It successfully avoids any information that is not visually present in the video.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It is detailed, precise, and perfectly aligned with all aspects of the instructions, demonstrating a clear understanding of how to describe spatial framing and dynamics in a video shot.",
