    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot of a classical-style building. The scene begins with a low-angle close-up on the molded base of a large stone column, which is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame. The building's curved wall is in the middle ground, while a city street is visible in the background on the right. The camera then pulls back, pans left, and tilts up with a counter-clockwise rotation, transitioning into a wide, low-angle shot of the building's entrance. In the final composition, a broad set of stone steps occupies the foreground and bottom of the frame, leading up to the columns and building facade in the middle ground. A white logo is consistently positioned in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video showcases a dynamic cityscape scene centered on a grand, classical-style building. The camera's sweeping motion captures the impressive scale and atmosphere of the urban environment, without focusing on a specific person or object. The shot is taken from an eye-level angle, highlighting the massive, round stone base of a large column before pulling back to reveal a wide set of stone steps leading up to the building's curved facade. The structure features light-colored stone block walls and a window with a grid pattern. In the background, a street with multiple passing cars can be seen under an overcast sky, with wet pavement reflecting the muted light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Set outdoors on an overcast day, the scene captures a grand, classical-style building with a curved facade. The camera starts with a level angle on the molded base of a large, white stone column, then pulls back to reveal a wide, wet stone pavement and a set of broad stone stairs. The building's walls are made of light-brown stone blocks, and other similar columns line the colonnade. In the background, a city street is visible with buildings, streetlights, and multiple cars. A white logo is present as an overlay in the bottom right corner of the screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main elements and their general positions, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and transitions. The description of the initial shot as a \"wide shot of a large stone column\" is slightly contradictory; it would be clearer to describe it as a medium shot of the column, which is positioned in the foreground against a wider view of the scene. The phrase \"The camera transitions\" is too vague; the feedback should specify the camera's movement, for instance, that it \"pulls back and pans left,\" causing the initial column to shift from the center to the right of the frame as the wider entrance is revealed. The description of the final scene lumps the steps, columns, and facade together in the middle ground, which flattens the sense of depth; it would be more accurate to state that the steps lead from just behind the foreground fence into the middle ground, connecting the two planes. Finally, the caption notes the initial \"level-angle\" but fails to describe the camera's final height, which, after pulling back, is now at a slight low angle to the building, emphasizing its scale.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a classical-style building with a focus on its architectural details. The scene opens with a medium shot of a large stone column in the foreground, set against a broader view of the building's curved wall in the middle ground and a city street visible in the background on the right. The camera pulls back and pans left, causing the column to shift from the center to the right of the frame, while tilting up with a counter-clockwise rotation to reveal a wide, low-angle shot of the building's entrance. In the final composition, a broad set of stone steps begins just behind the foreground fence and leads into the middle ground, connecting the steps to the columns and building facade, which are now emphasized by the camera's slight low angle, highlighting the building's grandeur. A white logo remains consistently positioned in the bottom right corner throughout the video.",
