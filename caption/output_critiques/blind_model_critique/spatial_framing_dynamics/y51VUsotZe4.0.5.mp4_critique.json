    "pre_caption": "This video is a scenery shot captured in a wide shot from a low-angle, forward-moving perspective, likely from a vehicle. A wet road occupies the center of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background. Buildings with numerous neon signs line both the left and right sides of the frame, creating a corridor effect. These signs are positioned in the middle ground, and their colorful lights reflect onto the wet pavement in the foreground and middle ground. The camera's wide-angle lens distorts the scene, causing the buildings at the top left and top right to appear curved inward, which enhances the sense of immersion as the viewpoint advances.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a drive through a vibrant, rain-slicked city street at night. The scene is dominated by a dense array of glowing neon signs in various colors—red, green, yellow, and blue—that line the buildings and reflect brilliantly off the wet pavement, creating a glossy, dreamlike atmosphere. The focus is on the immersive environment and moody aesthetic rather than a specific subject, an effect enhanced by the moving, wide-angle perspective that distorts the view and envelops the viewer in the dynamic, light-filled urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a drive through a city street at night. The pavement is wet, reflecting the vibrant glow from an abundance of colorful neon signs that adorn the multi-story buildings on both sides of the road. These signs, displaying Chinese characters, illuminate the scene in shades of red, green, yellow, and blue. As the vehicle moves forward along the dark street, it passes a white car parked on the right, with the lights of distant traffic visible ahead. The wide-angle lens gives the scene a distorted, immersive perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the main elements and the forward motion. However, it could be enhanced by including other dynamic elements typical of a dash-cam scene, such as other vehicles whose headlights and taillights would occupy the middle ground and background, adding more points of reference and depth. The description of the forward movement is a bit general; it could be more specific by describing the resulting parallax effect, where foreground reflections move rapidly across the frame while distant background signs remain more static. Furthermore, while \"scenery shot\" is accurate, using the term \"wide shot\" would be more precise. The spatial description of the signs could also be more detailed by specifying their vertical placement on the buildings, for example, noting that they are visible at various heights from street level to several stories up, which would better define the volume of the urban canyon.",
