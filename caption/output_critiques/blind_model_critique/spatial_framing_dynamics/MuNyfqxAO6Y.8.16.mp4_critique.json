    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot frames a modified car engine from an elevated perspective. A large turbocharger is positioned in the bottom-right foreground, while the green engine valve cover occupies the center-left of the middle ground. To the right of the valve cover, a silver radiator stands vertically in the middle ground. The dark green body of the car frames the scene from the bottom and left foreground and the right middle ground. The camera performs a very slow and subtle push-in, gradually tightening the framing on the engine components.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view reveals a highly modified car engine inside an open engine bay. The engine features a prominent, textured, metallic green valve cover with the words \"BMW M Power\" written in silver. In the foreground, a large turbocharger with a silver-colored compressor housing is visible, its intake partially covered by a woven carbon fiber heat shield. Various black hoses and silver pipes connect the components, and a silver radiator is situated in the background. While the surrounding body of the car is painted a dark, glossy green, additional angles or clearer visuals would help better showcase this feature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor, close-up view focuses on the engine bay of a car during sunrise or sunset. The open hood reveals a highly modified engine, with the most prominent feature being a sparkly, textured green valve cover with raised silver \"BMW M Power\" lettering. In the foreground, a large, silver turbocharger with a carbon fiber heat shield is visible. To the left of the turbocharger, a silver radiator stands vertically. The warm, golden light reflects off the car's glossy paint and the metallic engine components, though the car's color is not clearly visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main components and the camera movement, it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and miss some key visual details. The description of the car's body framing the scene from the \"bottom and right foreground and the right middle ground\" is slightly convoluted and could be simplified. The caption also overlooks a prominent, polished silver intake pipe that snakes from the turbocharger in the foreground, across the center of the frame, and connects to the engine block in the middle ground, creating a strong leading line. Furthermore, positioning the radiator in the \"middle ground\" seems spatially inaccurate; from the elevated angle, the radiator is visibly set deeper in the engine bay, placing it in the background behind the engine block. Finally, the description of the camera movement could be more specific about its effect; the slow push-in doesn't just tighten the framing generally but specifically draws more focus to the texture of the green valve cover and the intricate fins of the turbocharger, making them the clear focal points by the end of the shot.",
