    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an underwater scene. A large, elongated, dark object is positioned in the middle ground, stretching diagonally from the center-left towards the center-right of the frame. The sandy seabed occupies the foreground and the bottom portion of the frame, extending into the middle ground where the object rests. Deep blue water fills the background and the upper portion of the frame. Small, white particles are visible drifting throughout the foreground, middle ground, and background. An overlay is present in the lower-left foreground. The camera maintains a fixed position, slightly elevated relative to the seabed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an underwater scenery shot. The focus is on the dark, mysterious deep-sea environment, characterized by deep blue water and floating white particles resembling marine snow. A large, elongated, dark object with a textured, reddish-brown upper surface and cracked, greyish sides lies partially buried in the sandy seabed. The dim, atmospheric lighting and the partial obscurity of the object emphasize the vastness and enigmatic nature of the underwater world rather than highlighting a specific, fully detailed subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set deep underwater, with a dark blue background. A large, elongated, dark object, resembling a sunken ship's hull, rests partially buried in the lighter-colored, sandy seabed. The visible portion of the hull has a dark, cracked texture on its sides, while its upper surface appears reddish and mottled. Small, white, speck-like particles drift slowly through the water. An overlay in the lower-left corner reads \"[2]\".**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the large dark object, the sandy seabed, the water, the drifting particles, and the overlay. The descriptions of their spatial relationships, such as the object resting on the seabed and stretching diagonally, are precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully addresses every component required by the instructions.\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the \"wide shot\" of the scenery.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It meticulously describes the 2D position (center-left, bottom, upper, lower-left) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) for every significant element.\n    *   **Dynamics:** It notes the \"drifting\" motion of the particles and correctly states that the \"camera maintains a fixed position.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** It accurately describes the camera as \"slightly elevated relative to the seabed.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the stylistic and content rules perfectly.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It uses neutral, descriptive terms like \"large, elongated, dark object\" instead of speculating on what it might be (e.g., a shipwreck, a log). It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is written in simple, natural English, forming a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to understand while being rich in detail.\n    *   **No Speculation:** It strictly adheres to describing only what is visible, avoiding phrases like \"it seems to be\" or \"it might be.\"\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.",
