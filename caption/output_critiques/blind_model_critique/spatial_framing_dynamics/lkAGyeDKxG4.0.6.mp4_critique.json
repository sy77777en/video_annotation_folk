    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a silhouetted man is positioned in the right-center of the frame, walking through the middle ground of a mountainous landscape. In the background, a range of snow-capped mountains extends across the horizon. The foreground and middle ground are covered with rocks, patches of snow, and a few sparse trees. As the man walks from right to left, the camera, positioned at his level, tracks alongside him, keeping him centered in the frame while revealing more of the terrain to the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen in silhouette against a light sky, walks from right toward left. He is dressed in dark, full-length clothing, including a dark beanie on his head, and carries a large, dark backpack. He uses two hiking poles for support as he moves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a high-altitude, mountainous landscape at sunrise or sunset, a silhouetted figure with a backpack and two hiking poles walks across the rugged terrain. The ground is a mix of dark, reddish-brown vegetation, scattered grey rocks, and patches of snow. A few sparse coniferous trees, with orange autumnal foliage, dot the hillside. In the distance, a vast range of snow-capped mountains is visible under a pale, golden sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the basic composition and camera movement, but it could be more specific about the spatial relationships and visual details. While the man is described as \"silhouetted,\" some features, such as a large backpack and a walking stick, might be discernible, making \"mostly silhouetted\" a more precise term. The description combines the foreground and middle ground, but the video might feature distinct, out-of-focus rocks in the immediate foreground that frame the man as he walks through the clearer middle ground, creating a stronger sense of depth. The caption also omits the sky, a dominant element in a wide landscape shot; describing it—for instance, as a bright, overcast sky against which the dark mountains are set—would provide crucial context. Lastly, while the camera tracks the subject, it might also be performing a subtle pan to the left, which is what \"revealing more of the terrain\" implies; specifying this combined movement (a tracking pan) would be more descriptive of the camera's dynamic action.",
