    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the full bodies of the two men on the central escalator and the woman standing to the left. The larger man is positioned near the top center of the escalator in the middle ground, leaning forward with his hands outstretched, while the smaller man is directly below him, also centered, occupying the lower part of the escalator in the middle ground. The woman stands at the bottom left of the frame in the foreground, near a counter and display case. Mannequins and a display cabinet are visible to the far left and right in the foreground, while a decorative balustrade and additional store elements fill the background above and behind the escalator. The camera remains at the subjects’ height, parallel to the escalator, and there is no significant change in shot size or camera angle during the scene. The spatial arrangement keeps the escalator and its riders as the central focus, with supporting elements and other figures distributed along the left and right edges of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black-and-white scene, two men are on a central escalator moving upwards. The man positioned higher on the escalator is a large individual with a prominent dark beard and mustache, wearing a dark suit. He is leaning forward with his hands outstretched. Below him, a smaller man with a dark mustache and a dark suit is attempting to move down the escalator but is being pushed upwards after having fallen midway. To the left, a woman with dark, styled hair stands near a counter. She is wearing a dark coat with wide, white fur trim on the cuffs and collar over a lighter-colored dress.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in what appears to be a vintage clothing or department store, characterized by an escalator moving upward, a display case filled with various items, and mannequins dressed in period clothing. The environment features a cabinet filled with square packages and a decorative balustrade above the escalator. The lighting is even, suggesting daytime or well-lit interior conditions. The scene is presented in black and white, giving it a monochromatic appearance. Several people are present, with some attempting to descend on the escalator and others standing nearby, their attire matching the early 20th-century setting. No overlays, text, or digital elements are visible within the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is **excellent** and serves as a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres strictly to all stylistic and structural requirements.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene.\n*   It correctly identifies the **shot size** as a \"wide shot\" because it captures the full bodies of the main subjects.\n*   The **spatial positioning** is precise: the two men are correctly placed in the \"top center\" and \"lower center\" of the \"middle ground,\" the woman is at the \"bottom left\" in the \"foreground,\" and other elements like mannequins and the balustrade are correctly assigned to the \"foreground\" and \"background.\"\n*   The description of the men's actions (\"leaning forward with his hands outstretched\") is an accurate observation of their spatial posture and dynamic within the frame.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very thorough. It successfully addresses every component requested in the instructions.\n*   It details the **shot size**, the **2D position** (left, right, center), the **3D depth** (foreground, middle ground, background), and the **camera's height** (\"at the subjects’ height\").\n*   It correctly notes the lack of movement, stating there is \"no significant change in shot size or camera angle,\" which fulfills the requirement to describe any changes (or lack thereof).\n*   It effectively describes the main subjects (the two men) in detail while also including secondary subjects (the woman) and other key environmental elements (counter, mannequins, balustrade), providing a complete picture of the spatial composition.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The caption is perfectly structured as a single, coherent paragraph. It begins with the shot size, moves to the spatial positions of subjects and elements, discusses the camera height and dynamics, and concludes with a summary of the overall composition, all in a logical sequence.\n*   **Language and Tone:** The language is simple, natural, and objective, exactly as requested. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and ambiguity.\n*   **Focus:** The description remains focused entirely on **spatial framing and dynamics**, without straying into narrative or interpretation. The detail about the camera being \"parallel to the escalator\" is a particularly strong observation that directly addresses the spatial relationship between the camera and the scene's geometry.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an outstanding execution of the instructions. It is a clear, concise, and technically precise description of the video's visual composition.",
