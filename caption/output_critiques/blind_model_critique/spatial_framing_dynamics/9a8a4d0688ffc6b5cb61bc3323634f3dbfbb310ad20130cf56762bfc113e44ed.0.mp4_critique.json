    "pre_caption": "This medium shot opens with the back of a curly-haired person with a backpack positioned in the center-right foreground. In the center background, a man reading a book walks toward the camera along a hallway, with a large painting on the left wall in the middle ground and double doors at the far end of the hall. As the shot progresses, the curly-haired person walks away from the camera into the middle ground. A second person enters from the bottom-left foreground and also walks away, remaining on the left side of the frame. The man continues to approach from the background, moving into the middle ground until he is framed between the two figures walking away. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three people in a hallway. In the foreground, a person with voluminous, light-brown curly hair is seen from behind, wearing a rust-colored jacket and a brown leather backpack with crisscrossing straps. Walking towards them in the middle ground is a man with dark hair and a short beard, dressed in a white shirt, a dark jacket, and dark gray pants; he is looking down at an open book he holds in his hands. A third person with long, straight dark hair, wearing a black jacket and carrying a white patterned tote bag, enters from the left and is also seen from behind. The man is positioned further behind the two people who have their backs to the camera as they all walk in the same general area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place inside a well-lit hallway with white walls and a reflective, light-colored floor. On the left wall, a large, rectangular black-and-white abstract painting is displayed. In the middle of the corridor, there is a doorway without doors, with a green exit sign visible above the doorframe. At the far end of the corridor, a set of double doors with glass panels reveals daylight from outside. People are walking through the hall; two women, one wearing a brown leather backpack and the other carrying a white bag, are seen from behind walking away, while a man in a dark jacket walks toward the viewer, reading an open book.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video opens with a medium shot, showing the back of a curly-haired figure with a backpack walking in the foreground, while a man holding a book approaches from the background. A third figure then enters the scene as all three walk toward each other in a hallway. The curly-haired figure and another person with long dark hair are seen from behind, with the man holding the book partially visible between them.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the initial spatial arrangement, but it misses a key dynamic and could be more precise. While it correctly notes the man walks toward the camera, it fails to mention the resulting change in his shot size, which would transition from a medium long shot to a medium close-up by the end, a significant aspect of the shot's dynamics. The description of his final position \"initially framed to the right... and finally between them\" is slightly convoluted; simply stating that he approaches to occupy the central space between the two departing figures would be clearer. Additionally, the caption could specify the position of the background elements more precisely, for instance, by noting that the double doors are in the center-background. Finally, stating the man is \"reading a book\" is a specific action that might be an assumption; he could simply be carrying it, and describing him as \"a man holding a book\" would be a safer, more objective observation.",
