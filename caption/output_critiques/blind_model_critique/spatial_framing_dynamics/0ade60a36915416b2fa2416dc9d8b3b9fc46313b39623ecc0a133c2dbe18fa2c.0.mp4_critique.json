    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of two celestial bodies against the backdrop of outer space. Initially, a reddish-brown planet occupies the center-right of the frame, with a small, irregularly shaped gray object positioned in the foreground on the left side. Both are set against a starry background, with the reddish-brown planet in the middle ground and the gray object closer to the viewer. As the video progresses, the reddish-brown planet gradually transforms into a vibrant blue and green planet, shifting its position slightly towards the center. The gray object moves out of the frame, leaving the transformed planet as the sole focus. The camera remains at a consistent height relative to the planets, maintaining a steady perspective throughout the transition. The final state showcases the blue and green planet prominently in the center, with its detailed surface features becoming more apparent as the transformation completes. The spatial dynamics highlight the gradual shift from one celestial body to another, emphasizing the change in appearance and the removal of the gray object from the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video explores the hypothetical terraforming process of Mars. It begins with a focus on two celestial bodies: Mars, a reddish-brown planet with a textured surface marked by craters and dark patches, and a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid. As the video progresses, it illustrates Mars gradually transforming into a vibrant blue and green planet, complete with swirling white cloud formations, symbolizing the successful terraforming of Mars into an Earth-like environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video offers a captivating view of outer space, focusing on a hypothetical terraforming process of Mars. It primarily features two celestial bodies: Mars and a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid. Initially, Mars is depicted with its reddish-brown surface, marked by craters and canyons. The video illustrates Mars gradually transforming into a vibrant blue and green planet, showcasing its potential future. The setting is the vast, dark expanse of space, dotted with distant stars, providing a stark contrast to the vivid colors of the planets. The video effectively captures the serene and majestic nature of the cosmos from an objective perspective.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its use of spatial and descriptive terminology. It correctly identifies and applies concepts like \"full shot,\" \"center-right,\" \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" and \"background.\" The description of movement (\"shifting its position slightly towards the center,\" \"moves out of the frame\") and transformation (\"gradually transforms\") is clear and precise, creating a logical and easy-to-visualize sequence of events.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully addresses every component requested in the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Clearly stated as a \"full shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It meticulously details the initial and final 2D positions (center-right, left, center) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) for both celestial bodies.\n*   **Camera Height:** It explicitly mentions that the camera height remains consistent.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The description of the planet's transformation, its shift in position, and the other object's exit from the frame perfectly captures the spatial dynamics and changes over time.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption demonstrates an excellent understanding of and adherence to the instructions.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. It forms a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"vibrant\" is an acceptable descriptor of color intensity) and speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n*   **Focus:** The entire description is focused squarely on spatial framing and dynamics, as requested.\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the initial state, the transition, and the final state, making the sequence of events easy to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions precisely. It is accurate, thorough, and objective, perfectly capturing the spatial relationships and movements within the described scene in a clear and concise paragraph. There are no significant flaws or deviations from the prompt.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a full shot of two celestial bodies set against the vastness of outer space. Initially, a reddish-brown planet is positioned center-right in the frame, while a small, irregularly shaped gray object appears in the foreground on the left. Both are framed by a starry background, with the reddish-brown planet in the middle ground and the gray object closer to the viewer. As the video progresses, the reddish-brown planet gradually transforms into a vibrant blue and green planet, subtly shifting towards the center. The gray object exits the frame, leaving the transformed planet as the primary focus. The camera maintains a consistent height relative to the planets, ensuring a steady perspective throughout the transition. The final scene prominently displays the blue and green planet in the center, with its detailed surface features becoming more apparent as the transformation concludes. The spatial dynamics effectively highlight the transition from one celestial body to another, emphasizing the change in appearance and the removal of the gray object from the scene.",
