    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium close-up of an ornate golden key floating and rotating in the center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the background, an old computer monitor is visible in the center-right, and a classical statue stands in the top-left. A large wooden chest occupies the bottom-left foreground. The camera, remaining at the key's height, pans left and tilts down, following the key as it moves toward the chest. The shot transitions into a close-up, with the wooden chest now centered in the foreground. The key aligns with the chest's keyhole, also in the center foreground, while a patterned rug is visible at the bottom of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An ornate, golden key is shown floating and rotating. It features a complex, swirling, filigree-like bow and a simple bit. The key moves toward a large, dark wooden chest with a rounded lid. The chest is reinforced with dark metal straps, each adorned with a metallic, four-leaf clover-shaped embellishment. A prominent, shield-shaped metal plate on the front of the chest features a keyhole, which is framed by a short, dangling chain. The key is positioned to enter the keyhole, as if to unlock the chest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with red-striped wallpaper, an ornate golden key floats through the air. The camera follows the key as it moves away from an old, beige computer monitor perched on a wooden stool and drifts toward a large wooden treasure chest resting on a patterned rug. The chest is bound with dark metal straps and has a prominent lock on its front, into which the key inserts itself. In the background, a classical-style statue is partially visible.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a golden key floating and rotating in the center of the frame. It moves toward the keyhole of a wooden chest, with the video highlighting both objects in full view and fine detail.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera remains at the same height as the floating golden key throughout.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the core action but could be more precise with its spatial terminology and the description of the shot's progression. Using \"full shot\" for a key is unconventional; \"medium close-up\" would be more accurate, as the key is the primary subject but doesn't fill the entire screen. The description of depth could be refined; the chest is likely in the near-foreground or foreground-left, not sharing the middle ground with the computer monitor, which creates a more dynamic sense of depth between the elements. The caption's description of the final state is also incomplete. As the camera trucks left, the shot composition changes significantly, tightening into a close-up on the chest's lock as the key inserts itself, making the chest the dominant subject in the frame rather than just an element in the bottom-left. Furthermore, the caption omits the camera's height, which is positioned at a high angle looking down upon the scene, and it fails to mention that the focus racks from the key to the chest's keyhole during the camera movement, guiding the viewer's attention.",
