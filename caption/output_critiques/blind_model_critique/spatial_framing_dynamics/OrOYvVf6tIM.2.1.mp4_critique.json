    "pre_caption": "This scene is framed as a low-angle medium shot. In the foreground, the out-of-focus upper half of a person's head occupies the bottom center of the frame. A man stands in the middle ground, initially positioned in the center and looking down toward the foreground. In the background, a light fixture is visible in the upper left, while a partition wall with a framed picture is on the right. The man in the middle ground then turns and walks toward the left, exiting the frame completely.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In the foreground, the out-of-focus upper half of a person's head with dark hair is visible at the bottom of the frame, turned sideways. The main subject, positioned in the middle ground and in sharp focus, is a man shown from the waist up. He has dark, wavy hair, a beard, and is wearing a white t-shirt under a dark, unzipped jacket. He initially stands looking down toward the foreground person before turning and walking out of the frame to the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors in a dimly lit room. The room has beige walls. A light fixture hangs from the ceiling, providing a warm, ambient glow. A framed picture hangs on a partition wall to the right. A man in a dark jacket over a white t-shirt stands in the center of the frame, while the back of another person's head is visible in the foreground.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: In this video, the foreground shows the upper half of a person's head, positioned at the bottom center of the frame, turned sideways to the camera and out of focus. In the middle ground, another person is shown in a medium shot, facing the camera and in sharp focus, and then he walks out of the frame from the left.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its use of descriptive terminology. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"low-angle medium shot.\" The descriptions of the elements are precise and objective (e.g., \"out-of-focus upper half of a person's head,\" \"partition wall with a framed picture\"), avoiding any subjective interpretation or emotional language.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very thorough and successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the \"medium shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D and 3D):** It meticulously maps out the scene. For each key element (foreground head, middle-ground man, background fixtures), it provides both its 2D position within the frame (bottom center, center, upper left, right) and its 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background).\n*   **Camera Height:** It clearly states the camera's position as \"low-angle.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics and Movement:** It effectively describes the initial static composition and then details the man's movement (\"turns and walks toward the left\") and his eventual disappearance (\"exiting the frame completely\"), fulfilling the requirement to describe changes and subjects leaving the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural English that is easy to understand.\n*   It strictly avoids speculation, ambiguity, and emotional adjectives.\n*   Its entire focus is on the **spatial framing and dynamics**, as requested. It doesn't stray into narrative or character analysis.\n*   It successfully describes multiple subjects/elements at different depths, detailing their placement and any relevant movement.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It is precise, comprehensive, and strictly adheres to all positive and negative constraints outlined in the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is captured in a low-angle medium shot. In the foreground, the blurred upper half of a person's head is positioned at the bottom center of the frame. A man stands in the middle ground, initially centered and looking down toward the foreground. In the background, a light fixture is visible in the upper left, while a partition wall with a framed picture is on the right. The man in the middle ground then turns and walks to the left, eventually exiting the frame completely.",
