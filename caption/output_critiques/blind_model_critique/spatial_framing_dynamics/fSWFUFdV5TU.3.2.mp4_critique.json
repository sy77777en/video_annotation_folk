    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames a young man, who is positioned in the right foreground of the frame against a dark, indistinct background. The camera is held at his eye level and is slightly tilted. The framing remains static throughout the clip, with no changes in shot size, camera position, or subject placement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with curly dark hair, captured in close-up. He has a focused expression, with his eyes wide open, suggesting attentiveness or surprise. The lighting changes from a warm tone to a red hue, highlighting his facial features and casting shadows that emphasize his expression. The camera appears to be tilted, adding to the intensity of his gaze.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors, featuring a dimly lit environment with a focus on a single subject. The setting is characterized by subdued lighting that casts shadows, creating a moody atmosphere. The transition in lighting from a warm tone to a red hue suggests a change in mood or situation. The background remains indistinct, emphasizing the subject's expression and the shift in lighting. The overall scene is intimate and focused, with minimal distractions from the surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on your instructions, here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the shot as a \"close-up.\"\n*   **Subject and Position:** It accurately describes a \"young man\" positioned in the \"right foreground.\"\n*   **Background:** The description of a \"dark, indistinct background\" is correct.\n*   **Camera:** It correctly notes that the camera is at \"eye level\" and, importantly, includes the detail that it is \"slightly tilted,\" which is a key aspect of the framing.\n*   **Dynamics:** The statement that the framing is \"static\" with no changes is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and successfully addresses all the requirements of the instructions.\n*   It specifies the shot size, the subject's 2D position (right), 3D position (foreground), and the camera's height (eye level).\n*   It describes the spatial dynamics by noting the static nature of the shot and the lack of any movement or changes in framing.\n*   It includes a nuanced detail about the camera's spatial orientation by mentioning the tilt.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption perfectly adheres to all the given rules.\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative terms.\n*   It focuses exclusively on the visible spatial framing and dynamics.\n*   It correctly identifies the lack of change, as per the instruction to \"describe any changes.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of what was requested, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and concise, perfectly capturing the spatial framing and static nature of the video without adding any unnecessary or speculative information.",
