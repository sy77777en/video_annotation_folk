    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground, with the camera at her eye level. In the middle ground, several woven pendant lights hang from the top of the frame, flanking the woman. Vertical rods are also visible in the middle ground, set against a plain wall in the background. The woman then moves to the right, exiting the frame and leaving a static shot of the empty middle ground and background elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with dark brown hair styled in an updo. She is wearing a white top, a large gold statement necklace, and earrings. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing forward. The woman gradually disappears from the frame, leaving the scene empty.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a modern, minimalist space with a neutral color palette. The environment features a series of pendant lights hanging from the ceiling, casting a soft glow. Black rods, likely part of the set design, are noticeable, from which several woven bamboo cage-like objects are hanging, adding an intriguing element to the decor. The walls are plain and light-colored, contributing to the clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The setting includes a few decorative elements, such as dried floral arrangements, adding a touch of natural texture. The lighting is consistent, suggesting an artificial, controlled environment without any indication of the time of day. The overall atmosphere is calm and composed, with a focus on simplicity and elegance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subject and elements, it could be more precise about their spatial relationships and the dynamics of the movement. The description of the middle ground is somewhat generalized; for instance, the woven pendant lights might be positioned slightly in front of the vertical rods, creating more distinct layers of depth that are not mentioned. The caption also assumes a completely static camera after the woman exits; however, the camera could perform a subtle focus pull, shifting from the woman to the pendant lights in the middle ground as she leaves, which would be a key spatial dynamic. Furthermore, describing the lights as \"flanking the woman\" is vague; specifying their 2D positions, such as one in the top left and another in the top right, would offer greater clarity. Finally, the description of the woman's exit is minimal; detailing her movement, such as her turning her head to the right before she moves out of the frame, would provide a more complete picture of the action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman positioned centrally in the foreground, with the camera at her eye level. In the middle ground, several woven pendant lights hang slightly in front of vertical rods, creating distinct layers of depth against a plain wall in the background. The pendant lights are positioned with one in the top left and another in the top right of the frame. As the woman turns her head to the right and begins to move out of the frame, the camera subtly shifts focus from her to the pendant lights, enhancing the spatial dynamics. This focus pull highlights the transition from the foreground to the middle ground, leaving a static shot of the empty middle ground and background elements once the woman exits.",
