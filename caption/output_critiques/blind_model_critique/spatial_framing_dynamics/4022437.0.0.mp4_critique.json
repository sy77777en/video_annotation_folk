    "pre_caption": "This is a full, low-angle shot where a black car with its doors open is positioned in the middle ground, slightly right of center. The asphalt pavement, marked with white lines, occupies the entire foreground and extends to the middle ground beneath the car. In the background, several white buildings are visible behind the vehicle, with a tree to the far left and a construction crane to the far right. The camera slowly pulls backward, causing the car to recede slightly further into the middle ground and become smaller within the frame, while revealing more of the pavement in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan parked in an outdoor paved area marked with white lines. The car is viewed from a level angle, positioned at the left rear of the vehicle. All four of its doors are open, revealing a light tan or beige interior. The car features silver, multi-spoke alloy wheels, and several buildings are visible in the background.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a level-angle perspective close to the ground, the scene is set in a paved asphalt parking lot during the day under a partly cloudy blue sky. A black sedan with a tan interior is parked with all four of its doors open. In the background, there are several single-story white buildings, a chain-link fence, and a distant construction crane. The camera slowly moves backward across the worn pavement, which is marked with white parking lines, away from the rear three-quarter view of the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully meets all the requirements of the prompt.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Detail:** The caption provides a precise and detailed description of the scene's spatial composition. It correctly identifies the main subject (car), its state (doors open), and other key elements (pavement, buildings, tree, crane), which helps build a clear mental image.\n\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:**\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the shot as a \"full, low-angle shot\" at the beginning.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D and 3D):** It masterfully describes the position of every key element. For example, the car is \"middle ground, slightly right of center,\" the pavement is \"foreground,\" and the buildings, tree, and crane are in the \"background\" with their respective 2D positions (\"far left,\" \"far right\"). This creates a clear sense of depth.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states the shot is \"low-angle,\" fulfilling the requirement to describe the camera's height relative to the subject.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics and Movement:** The description of the camera movement (\"slowly pulls backward\") and its effect on the scene is perfect. It explains how the car \"recede[s] slightly further\" and \"become[s] smaller,\" and how more of the \"pavement in the foreground\" is revealed. This captures the dynamic nature of the shot.\n\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon while remaining technically descriptive. The entire description is consolidated into a single, coherent paragraph as requested.\n\n*   **Avoidance of Prohibited Elements:** The caption strictly avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and any information that isn't directly related to the visual and spatial framing.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is thorough, precise, and well-structured, perfectly capturing the spatial framing and dynamics of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a full, low-angle shot featuring a black car with its doors open, positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground. The asphalt pavement, marked with white lines, spans the entire foreground and extends beneath the car into the middle ground. In the background, several white buildings are visible behind the vehicle, with a tree on the far left and a construction crane on the far right. The camera slowly pulls backward, causing the car to recede further into the middle ground and appear smaller within the frame, while revealing more of the pavement in the foreground.",
