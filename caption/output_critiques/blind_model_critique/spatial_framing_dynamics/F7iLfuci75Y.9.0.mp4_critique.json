In the right middle ground, one figure is seen from the back, with another figure to its left in the center middle ground.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features four humanoid figures seated at desks, each facing a computer screen. These figures have a metallic appearance, suggesting they might be robots or mannequins. They are positioned in a dimly lit room, with two figures visible in the middleground and two in the background. Each figure is oriented towards their respective screen, with their heads slightly tilted as if focused on the monitors. The figures are uniformly dressed in dark clothing, and their metallic heads reflect the light from the screens, creating a consistent visual theme throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit indoor setting, four figures with a reflective, metallic quality are present. Two of them are seated in a row at black desks, while the other two are positioned opposite each other, to the left and behind the first two. Dressed in black, they sit in matching office chairs, each facing a computer. The monitors are the primary light source, casting a blue glow onto the figures and their surroundings. Each screen displays a light blue background with a white, window-like logo. The overall environment is dark and monochromatic, defined by the arrangement of workstations.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions, focusing precisely on spatial framing and dynamics while adhering to all stylistic and content constraints. It is accurate, clear, and well-structured.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately uses cinematographic and spatial terminology.\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"full shot.\"\n    *   **Position (2D & 3D):** It does an outstanding job of pinpointing the location of all four subjects. It provides both the 2D position within the frame (left, right, center) and the 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) for each figure, which is exactly what the instructions require. For example, \"right middle ground,\" \"center middle ground,\" \"left background,\" and \"left foreground\" are precise and informative.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly specifies the camera's height relative to the subjects (\"at the subjects' level\").\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough in describing the static composition of the scene.\n    *   It accounts for all major subjects (\"four humanoid figures\") and relevant elements (\"desks,\" \"computer monitor\").\n    *   It successfully integrates details about framing (\"partially occupy\") and the environment (\"dimly lit room,\" \"monitor... is the main source of light\") that contribute to the understanding of the space without being subjective.\n    *   **One Potential Omission:** The instructions ask to describe \"any changes\" and \"notable spatial movements.\" The caption describes a completely static scene. If the figures or the camera are moving in the video, this caption would be incomplete as it fails to describe those dynamics. However, if the video is a static shot, the caption is perfectly complete.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the negative and positive constraints perfectly.\n    *   **Clarity and Tone:** It uses \"simple, natural English\" and is \"concise yet informative.\" The language is neutral and objective.\n    *   **Avoided Elements:** It successfully avoids emotional/subjective adjectives, speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and ambiguous options.\n    *   **Focus:** The entire paragraph is dedicated to \"spatial framing and dynamics,\" as requested. It does not stray into narrative, character analysis, or other non-spatial descriptions.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. Its only potential flaw is the lack of description of movement, which is only a flaw if movement exists in the video. Assuming the video is a static shot, the caption is flawless.",
