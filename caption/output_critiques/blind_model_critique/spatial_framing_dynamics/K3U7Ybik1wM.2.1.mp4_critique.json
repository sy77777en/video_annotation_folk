    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up scenery shot of a meadow. Initially, the focus is on the yellow flowers in the middle ground, which are spread across the entire frame. The flowers in the foreground are out of focus, appearing as large, soft yellow blurs. The camera is positioned at a low angle, close to the ground. Throughout the shot, the focus smoothly shifts from the middle ground to the foreground, bringing the flowers closest to the camera into sharp detail while the middle ground and background become completely blurred.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a nature scenery shot, specifically a close-up view of a vibrant green meadow dotted with numerous small, bright yellow buttercups and a few tiny white flowers. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the flower-filled field, with the camera's shallow depth of field and shifting focus creating a soft, dreamlike quality that emphasizes the collective beauty of the scene rather than singling out any particular flower or element. The gentle sway of the flowers suggests a light breeze, further contributing to the tranquil, natural ambiance.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene outdoor setting in a lush meadow filled with vibrant yellow flowers. The scene is set during the day, with natural light illuminating the landscape. The meadow stretches into the distance, creating a sense of vastness and tranquility. Initially, the midground is in focus, showcasing many yellow flowers. Towards the end, the focus transitions to a single flower in the foreground, while the midground and background become out of focus, creating an aesthetic bokeh effect with hues from the yellow flowers and rich green grass. The setting is natural and peaceful.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its technical description. It correctly identifies a \"close-up scenery shot\" and accurately describes a common videography technique known as a \"rack focus\" or \"focus pull.\" The description of elements moving from out-of-focus blurs to sharp detail and vice-versa is a precise way to explain the change in depth of field, which is a key spatial dynamic.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally complete and addresses all the requirements of the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the \"close-up scenery shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D and 3D):** It clearly defines the 3D positions (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground\") and the 2D position of the middle-ground flowers (\"spread across the entire frame\").\n*   **Depth:** It thoroughly describes depth through the use of focus, mentioning what is \"in focus,\" \"out of focus,\" \"sharp detail,\" and \"blurred.\"\n*   **Height:** It specifies the camera's relative height as a \"low angle, close to the ground.\"\n*   **Changes:** It provides a detailed and clear description of the primary dynamic in the shot: the smooth focus shift from the middle ground to the foreground, including the initial and final states of focus for different parts of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the stylistic and content rules perfectly.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural English (\"smoothly shifts,\" \"bringing... into sharp detail\").\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (words like \"soft\" and \"sharp\" are used in their technical, descriptive sense related to focus).\n*   It avoids speculation and ambiguity entirely.\n*   It successfully describes the spatial framing and dynamics without narrating a story or inferring meaning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions precisely. It is concise, technically accurate, and complete, perfectly capturing the spatial dynamics of the shot by focusing on framing, depth, and movement of focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This close-up scenery shot of a meadow begins with a focus on the yellow flowers in the middle ground, which are spread across the entire frame. The foreground flowers are initially out of focus, appearing as large, soft yellow blurs. Positioned at a low angle close to the ground, the camera smoothly shifts focus from the middle ground to the foreground, bringing the flowers closest to the camera into sharp detail while the middle ground and background become completely blurred.",
