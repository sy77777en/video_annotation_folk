    "pre_caption": "The scene opens on an interior setting, with a wooden chair visible in the right background and a rocking horse in the left background. A hand enters from the top left of the frame and places a teddy bear on the floor in the center foreground. The shot then tightens to a medium close-up, focusing on the bear's upper body, which now occupies the center of the frame. The background elements become out of focus, creating a shallow depth of field. As the bear sits stationary, a hand enters from the top of the frame and places a cap on its head. Throughout this sequence, the camera remains at the bear's eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A worn, dark brown teddy bear is the central subject. The plush bear has a fuzzy, slightly matted texture and visible stitching, giving it an aged appearance. It features mismatched eyes: one is a large, dark, four-holed button, while the other is a smaller, dark bead. A brown, flat, round bead forms its nose. Around its neck is a faded pink scarf tied in a knot. A light-skinned human hand places a dark gray, soft cap on the bear's head. The cap, made of a fabric or leather-like material with prominent stitching, complements the bear's button eye.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with a warm, soft glow, a worn, pinkish-brown teddy bear with mismatched button and bead eyes and a faded pink scarf is gently placed on a dark surface by a hand. The scene begins with an interior view featuring a wooden dressing table with a round, vintage mirror centrally placed in the background. To the right, a wooden high-back chair is visible, while a metallic rocking horse sits on the left. The background wall is adorned with delicate floral patterns, and the wooden floor adds to the cozy ambiance. As the scene progresses, the background softly blurs, drawing focus to the teddy bear.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video takes place in a home setting. It starts with a background featuring a chair, a vanity, and a rocking horse. A hand then places a plush bear on the floor in the foreground, showing its upper body. The focus shifts to the bear, and the hand puts a hat on its head.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: There is no subject at the beginning. Once the subject appears, the camera is at the same height as the subject, and the camera height remains unchanged.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video described. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption describes a plausible and visually coherent sequence. It correctly uses technical terms like \"medium close-up\" and \"shallow depth of field\" to accurately describe the visual composition and changes.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the transition from a wider initial shot (implied by the visible background) to a \"medium close-up\" on the bear.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It precisely locates every key element, providing both 2D position (left, right, center, top) and 3D depth (foreground, background). For example, \"wooden chair visible in the right background\" and \"teddy bear on the floor in the center foreground.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states that the camera remains at the \"bear's eye level,\" fulfilling this requirement.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It clearly describes all movements and changes, including the hand entering, the placement of the bear, the shot tightening, and the placement of the cap.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is dense with relevant information without being wordy or repetitive.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"cute bear,\" \"gentle hand\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"perhaps\").\n    *   **Focus:** The entire description is focused strictly on spatial framing and dynamics, as instructed.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph in simple, natural English, without any introductory text or markdown.",
