    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot frames an elderly man's face, which is positioned in the center of the frame and in the foreground. The background consists of a dimly lit, out-of-focus wall. The camera remains static and positioned at the man's eye level throughout the shot, maintaining a consistent framing on his face as he looks slightly toward the right of the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a close-up shot of an elderly, light-skinned man's face. He has graying, somewhat disheveled hair and deep wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes. His brows are furrowed, and his mouth is set in a firm, slightly downturned line. He is wearing a dark, possibly green, collared shirt. The scene is dimly lit, with warm light casting shadows across his features. He looks slightly to his right with a fixed, intense expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit interior, characterized by a plain, out-of-focus wall in a warm, neutral tone. Soft, directional lighting illuminates the space, casting pronounced shadows. An elderly man wearing a dark green shirt is positioned in the foreground, his face partially in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement is contradictory; stating the camera moves backward while maintaining \"consistent framing\" is inaccurate, as a pull-back inherently widens the shot. A more precise description would note that the shot transitions from a tight close-up, showing only the man's face, to a standard close-up that reveals his neck and the collar of his shirt. The claim that the man is in the \"center of the frame\" is likely an oversimplification; he is probably positioned slightly to the right of center, which provides \"look space\" on the left side of the frame to balance his gaze. Additionally, the caption misses subtle subject movements, such as a slight shift in his eyes or a minor change in expression that occurs during the camera pull, and it omits any discernible features in the out-of-focus background, like a soft light source or a shadow, which could add to the spatial description.",
