    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot, capturing the main subject—a man in a dark blue jacket and light blue jeans—standing near the bottom right of the frame in the foreground, facing toward the center left where the street musician is seated in the middle ground. The musician, with a guitar and a hat for tips on the ground, is positioned left of center in the frame and also in the middle ground. Several other people are scattered throughout the plaza, mostly in the background and middle ground, with some groups standing or walking across the open space, distributed from left to right. The camera is at the same height as the main subject, providing a level perspective. The visible camera interface overlay at the bottom of the frame reinforces the first-person point of view, with the camera body and lens occupying the bottom center foreground. The buildings and café tables with umbrellas form the background, stretching across the top and sides of the frame, while the sky fills the uppermost portion. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positions during the video; the framing remains stable, maintaining the spatial relationships between the main subject, musician, and surrounding elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with light skin, gray hair, and a short gray beard, who appears to be middle-aged and is wearing a dark blue jacket and light blue jeans; he stands with his hands in his pockets, facing toward a street musician. The musician, who is also a man with light skin and dark hair, is seated and playing an acoustic guitar; he wears a dark jacket and pants, and has a hat placed on the ground in front of him for tips. Several other people are present in the scene, including small groups and individuals walking or standing nearby, most dressed in casual clothing such as jackets and jeans. The main subject’s attention is directed toward the musician, while the other people appear to be either passing by or observing from a distance, establishing the musician as the focal point of the main subject’s interest.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor plaza bordered by tall, reddish-brown and beige buildings with green shutters and arched windows, some featuring ornate stonework. The ground is paved with large, light gray stone tiles. Several groups of people are scattered throughout the open space, some standing and others walking, while a street musician sits on a low stool playing a guitar near an open instrument case and a hat placed on the ground. To one side, a man in a dark jacket and jeans stands with his hands in his pockets, facing the musician. Outdoor café tables with umbrellas line the edge of the plaza, and the sky above is partly cloudy. Towards the end of the video, a camera slightly emerges from the bottom of the frame, indicating the perspective of someone actively recording or observing the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why it is a good caption:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible scene, correctly identifying subjects and elements and placing them within the frame. It uses precise, objective language (e.g., \"dark blue jacket,\" \"seated,\" \"plaza\") that avoids interpretation.\n\n*   **Completeness and Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the shot as a \"wide shot.\"\n    *   **Spatial Framing (2D and 3D):** It meticulously breaks down the scene. For the main subject, it specifies \"bottom right\" (2D) and \"foreground\" (3D). For the musician, \"left of center\" (2D) and \"middle ground\" (3D). It also covers background elements like buildings and other people, providing both their 2D and 3D positions.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states the camera is \"at the same height as the main subject,\" fulfilling that requirement.\n    *   **Dynamics and Changes:** It correctly notes the absence of movement by stating, \"There are no significant changes... the framing remains stable.\" This is just as important as describing movement when it occurs.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It correctly identifies a \"main subject\" and describes him in detail, while also covering the secondary subject (musician) and other people collectively.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The description is written in a single, coherent paragraph using simple, natural English. It is informative without being overly wordy.\n    *   **Avoids Prohibited Content:** The caption successfully avoids emotional adjectives, speculative language (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and any information not visible in the frame.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is thorough, precise, and well-structured, effectively translating the visual spatial information of the video into a clear and objective text description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a wide shot, capturing the main subject—a man in a dark blue jacket and light blue jeans—positioned near the bottom right of the frame in the foreground, facing toward the center left where a street musician is seated in the middle ground. The musician, equipped with a guitar and a hat for tips on the ground, is situated left of center in the frame and also in the middle ground. Several other people are dispersed throughout the plaza, primarily in the background and middle ground, with some groups standing or walking across the open space, distributed from left to right. The camera is aligned at the same height as the main subject, offering a level perspective. The visible camera interface overlay at the bottom of the frame emphasizes the first-person point of view, with the camera body and lens occupying the bottom center foreground. Buildings and café tables with umbrellas form the background, extending across the top and sides of the frame, while the sky occupies the uppermost portion. The shot size and spatial positions remain consistent throughout the video, maintaining the spatial relationships between the main subject, musician, and surrounding elements.",
