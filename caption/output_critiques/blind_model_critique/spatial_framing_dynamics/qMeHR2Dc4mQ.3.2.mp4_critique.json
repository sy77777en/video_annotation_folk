    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a close-up shot of a man with light skin, short dark curly hair, and a short dark beard and mustache. He is wearing a dark green or black hoodie and looks directly towards the camera with dark eyes. A small mark or scar is visible on his right cheek. His mouth is slightly parted, and he maintains a neutral expression throughout the brief clip. The background is predominantly dark, with some blurred objects still visible, focusing attention primarily on the man's face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features a close-up shot of a man in a dark hoodie, effectively centering his presence within a dimly lit indoor space. The low-key lighting highlights him while the background fades into near-total darkness, with faint outlines hinting at furniture, possibly a wooden chair. The man looks directly forward with a serious expression, and his mouth, initially closed, gradually opens by the end of the sequence, suggesting he is about to speak. The overall visual tone is dark and focused.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the shot size, subject, and basic camera movement, but it lacks the specific detail needed to fully capture the scene's spatial dynamics. The term \"close-up\" is too general; specifying if it's a medium close-up showing the man's shoulders or a tighter shot on his face would be more informative. Stating the man \"centers\" the frame is also an approximation; he might be positioned slightly off-center, and the caption fails to describe his orientation, such as whether he is facing the camera directly or is in a three-quarter view. The phrase \"intended to remain static\" is speculative and should be avoided. Most significantly, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the *effect* of the camera's forward movement, which would tighten the shot from a close-up to an extreme close-up, and it completely omits any potential movement from the subject himself. For instance, if the man leans forward as the camera pushes in, this reciprocal movement is a critical spatial dynamic that the description fails to capture. Finally, while the background is \"indistinct,\" a more detailed description could note the quality of the blur, such as the presence of soft, out-of-focus light sources (bokeh) in the upper portion of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a medium close-up shot of a man, capturing his shoulders and face, with the camera positioned at his eye level. The man is slightly off-center and oriented in a three-quarter view, facing slightly away from the camera. As the clip progresses, the camera subtly pushes in, transitioning the shot from a close-up to an extreme close-up, enhancing the intensity of the scene. The man leans forward in response to the camera's movement, creating a dynamic interaction between subject and lens. The background is dark and indistinct, with a soft blur that includes out-of-focus light sources, adding a subtle bokeh effect in the upper portion of the frame.",
