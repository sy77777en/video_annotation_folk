    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a pink hand occupies the bottom right foreground, holding a large pink phone that is centered in the frame. The background consists of a black-and-white checkered floor in the middle ground, with a blue and yellow globe positioned in the left middle ground and other geometric shapes further in the background. Within the frame of the phone's screen, a green, multi-eyed creature is positioned in the left and center middle ground, while one of its tentacles extends into the foreground to draw on a piece of paper located in the bottom right of the screen. The overall framing of the scene remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a surreal, animated scene, a pink-skinned hand holds a large, pink smartphone-like device. The device's screen displays an image of a large, green, brain-like creature with three large, yellow, pupil-less eyes, and numerous writhing tentacles. One of the creature's long, snake-like tentacles holds a yellow pencil with a red eraser and is shown drawing a diagram on a pink piece of paper that rests on a red desk. The drawing itself consists of black lines, circles, and a human figure. The entire scene is set against a black-and-white checkered floor, populated with other colorful, abstract objects, including a globe composed of two shades of blue on a yellow stand.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a first-person perspective, a pink hand holds a large, pink smartphone in a surreal room with a black-and-white checkerboard floor. In the background, various abstract objects are visible, including a globe in two shades of blue on a yellow stand and other colorful geometric shapes. The phone's screen displays an animated scene of a green, brain-like creature with three yellow eyes and numerous tentacles. The creature is positioned at a red desk, using one of its tentacles to hold a yellow pencil and draw a diagram on a piece of paper. The phone's interface shows a status bar with several icons and a line of stylized, unreadable text.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the key elements and their general placement, but it lacks dynamism and specificity regarding their spatial relationships and movement. It fails to establish the shot size, which is a medium close-up, and doesn't explicitly state that the first-person camera is angled high, looking down at the phone. The description is entirely static, missing the subtle tilt of the phone as the hand adjusts its grip, which causes the screen's reflection to shift. Furthermore, it overlooks the movement in the scene's depth; the globe in the middle ground is slowly rotating on its axis, and the geometric shapes in the background are not just positioned but are floating and gently turning. The caption also gives disproportionate attention to the action on the phone's screen (the creature drawing) instead of focusing on the spatial dynamics of the primary scene. A more accurate description would note the phone's movement from the bottom right slightly toward the center and mention the rotation of the globe and background shapes to fully capture the video's spatial dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a medium close-up from a first-person perspective, with the camera angled high, looking down at a pink hand holding a large pink phone. The phone is initially positioned in the bottom right foreground but subtly shifts toward the center as the hand adjusts its grip, causing the screen's reflection to change. The background features a black-and-white checkered floor in the middle ground, while a blue and yellow globe slowly rotates on its axis in the left middle ground. Further back, geometric shapes float and gently turn, adding depth and movement to the scene. On the phone's screen, a green, multi-eyed creature is visible, with one tentacle extending to draw on a piece of paper in the bottom right of the screen. The overall scene is dynamic, with the phone's movement and the rotating elements in the background contributing to the spatial dynamics throughout the clip.",
