    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a tree stump in the left foreground, with a picket fence in the middle ground and out-of-focus trees in the background.

The shot becomes a full shot of the squirrel, which remains positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the squirrel's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a grey squirrel as it jumps up from out of view to land on top of a tree stump with rough, textured bark. The squirrel has a mix of grey and brown fur from the top of its head to its tail, with a white underside, and a large, bushy tail. It settles on its hind legs, holding a small, indistinct object in its front paws, which it proceeds to nibble on.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an outdoor garden setting during the day, a cut tree stump with rough, brown bark is positioned in the foreground. A weathered, grey picket fence runs across the scene in the background. Beyond the fence, a dense area of bare, gnarled trees creates a natural backdrop. A grey squirrel with a bushy tail is situated on top of the stump.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a full shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a very good caption that adheres well to the instructions. It is accurate, clear, and effectively describes the spatial dynamics of the scene.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Strengths:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption correctly identifies and describes the spatial relationships between the stump (left foreground), fence (middle ground), and trees (background). It accurately portrays the squirrel's movement into the frame and its final position.\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:** It successfully focuses on spatial framing (shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height) and dynamics (the squirrel's jump) as requested.\n*   **Clarity and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and ambiguity, sticking strictly to what is visible.\n*   **Completeness of Elements:** It correctly includes:\n    *   **2D Position:** \"left,\" \"bottom of the frame.\"\n    *   **3D Depth:** \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background.\"\n    *   **Movement:** \"jumps up from the bottom... landing on top.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"positioned at the squirrel's level.\"\n    *   **Shot Size Change:** It correctly notes that the framing becomes a \"full shot\" once the squirrel is the main subject.\n\n### Area for Improvement:\n\n*   **Initial Shot Size:** The caption's only minor omission is that it doesn't specify the shot size at the very beginning, before the squirrel appears. The instruction states, \"First, specify the **shot size**... If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\" The caption describes the elements but doesn't label the initial framing (e.g., as a medium or wide shot of the stump and fence).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is excellent and almost perfectly follows all instructions. Its only flaw is the omission of the initial shot size. By adding that single detail, it would be a flawless execution of the prompt.\n\n**Example of a revised caption that includes the missing element:**\n\nThe video opens with a **medium shot** of a tree stump in the left foreground, with a picket fence in the middle ground and out-of-focus trees in the background. A grey squirrel then jumps up from the bottom of the frame to land on the stump, establishing a full shot of the animal, which remains positioned on the left side of the frame in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the squirrel's level.",
