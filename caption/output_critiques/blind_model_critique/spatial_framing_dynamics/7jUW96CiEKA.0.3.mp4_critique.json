    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a sunlit valley, capturing a vast landscape with a shallow river meandering through a grassy plain in the foreground. The river is positioned slightly left of center, extending towards the right. Several deer-like animals are scattered around the river, primarily in the bottom center of the frame, occupying the foreground. The middle ground features rolling hills covered with green trees, stretching across the frame from left to right. In the background, a range of hills rises against a clear blue sky, forming the upper portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a height that allows a comprehensive view of the landscape, emphasizing the expansive and serene quality of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, open area with lush greenery and a distant range of hills under a clear blue sky. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the scale and atmosphere, allowing viewers to appreciate the serene and untouched quality of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a wide, sunlit valley during the day. A shallow river meanders through a grassy plain in the foreground. In the background, rolling hills covered with green trees and some patches of drier vegetation rise against a clear blue sky. Several deer-like animals are visible in and around the river within the grassy area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene's composition. It correctly identifies the shot size as an \"extreme wide shot\" and accurately maps out the spatial layers of the landscape. The placement of the river (foreground, left of center), the animals (foreground, bottom center), the wooded hills (middle ground), and the distant hills (background, upper portion) is precise and follows the instructions for describing both 2D and 3D positions.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete but has one significant omission. While it thoroughly describes the static framing of the landscape elements, it fails to mention any movement, which is a key requirement of the instructions (\"describe any notable spatial movements\"). For a video, it is likely the animals are moving (grazing, walking) or the water is flowing. By not describing these dynamics, the caption describes the scene as if it were a still photograph, missing the \"dynamics\" aspect of the prompt. Additionally, the description of the camera height (\"a height that allows a comprehensive view\") is vague; a more direct description like \"from a high angle\" or \"from an elevated viewpoint\" would be better.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most instructions but violates a few key constraints:\n*   **Violation:** It uses the subjective adjective \"serene\" and the interpretative phrase \"emphasizing the expansive and serene quality of the scene.\" The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and to describe only the spatial framing, not the perceived quality or effect.\n*   **Minor Deviation:** The opening \"The video presents...\" is slightly introductory. A more direct start, such as \"An extreme wide shot captures...\", would be more in line with the instruction to return \"only the one-paragraph video description.\"\n*   **Partial Adherence:** It correctly avoids speculation (\"might be\") and uses simple, natural English to create a coherent paragraph.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is good at describing the static spatial composition of the scene with high accuracy and detail. However, it is flawed because it fails to describe any movement within the video and violates the rule against using subjective or interpretative language. To be fully compliant, it would need to incorporate any movement of the subjects and remove the final phrase about the scene's \"quality.\"",
