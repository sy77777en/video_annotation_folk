    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a small boat with five people on board, positioned in the midground of the frame, approaching a large ship. The camera, initially positioned above the subjects, captures the boat in the sea. As the boat nears the ship, the camera pans right, tracking the boat's movement and revealing part of the ship's structure. This transition shifts the focus to include the ship's deck, where a person in a suit and hat stands on the right side of the frame, observing the approaching boat. The camera's perspective changes to eye level as the boat gets closer, emphasizing the interaction between the small boat and the large ship within the calm maritime setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a small boat with five people on board approaching a large ship. The boat is in the sea, and the individuals appear to be rowing. As the boat nears the ship, the camera pans right, revealing part of the ship's structure and a person standing on the deck. This person is positioned on the right side of the frame, observing the approaching boat. The scene highlights the interaction between the small boat and the large ship, with the focus shifting from the boat to include the ship's deck and the person on it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a maritime scene set on a calm body of water during the day. The setting features a small rowboat with several individuals, initially seen from a distance and later approaching a larger ship. The water has small waves, and the scene is in black and white, with the white areas having a sepia-colored tone. The larger ship is visible with ropes and rigging, indicating a traditional sailing vessel. The transition from a distant view of the rowboat to a closer interaction with the ship highlights the movement across the water, emphasizing the nautical environment.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This video shows a small boat approaching a large ship. The camera, positioned on the large ship, captures the small boat in the sea with five people on board. As the boat gets closer, the camera pans right to track it, revealing part of the large ship and a person on deck.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject and then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas for improvement in accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the main subjects (a small boat, a large ship, people) and the primary camera movement (panning right).\n*   The use of terms like \"wide shot,\" \"midground,\" \"above the subjects,\" and \"eye level\" is generally correct in its application to the described scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Missing 2D Position:** The initial 2D position of the boat is not specified. For example, it doesn't state if the boat is in the center, bottom-left, or another part of the frame.\n*   **Missing 3D Position:** The 3D position of the person on the ship's deck is not mentioned. It only gives a 2D position (\"right side of the frame\").\n*   **Missing Shot Size Change:** The caption starts with \"wide shot\" but doesn't describe how the shot size changes. As the camera tracks the boat and gets closer, the framing likely tightens to a medium shot. This change is a key part of the spatial dynamics and is missing.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses the word \"calm\" (\"calm maritime setting\"), which is a subjective description of the environment.\n*   **Borderline Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"emphasizing the interaction\" is interpretive. It describes the *effect* of the shot rather than the objective spatial framing itself. A more neutral description would focus on how the subjects are framed together.\n*   **Clarity of Transition:** The sentence \"This transition shifts the focus...\" is slightly ambiguous. The shift in focus is a direct result of the continuous camera pan, not a separate event or a cut. The wording could be clearer to link the pan directly to the change in composition.\n*   **Conciseness:** The phrase \"captures the boat in the sea\" is redundant, as the preceding clause already establishes this.\n\nIn summary, the caption successfully describes the basic action and some spatial elements. However, it fails to provide a complete spatial analysis (missing 2D/3D positions and shot size changes) and violates the rule against using subjective language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a wide shot of a small boat with five people on board, positioned in the bottom-left of the frame, approaching a large ship. The camera, initially positioned above the subjects, captures the boat's movement across the sea. As the boat nears the ship, the camera pans right, tracking the boat's movement and revealing part of the ship's structure. This continuous pan shifts the composition to include the ship's deck, where a person in a suit and hat stands on the right side of the frame, slightly elevated above the deck. As the boat gets closer, the camera's perspective changes to eye level, and the framing tightens to a medium shot, highlighting the spatial relationship between the small boat and the large ship within the maritime setting.",
