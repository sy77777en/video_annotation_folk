    "pre_caption": "This video presents a static wide shot of a city street. A large white pickup truck occupies the bottom-left foreground, with a line of other cars stretching behind it into the left middle ground. The street runs through the center of the frame, receding into the foggy background. On both the left and right, buildings with prominent balconies frame the scene from the foreground to the middle ground. A covered sidewalk with support columns extends along the right side of the frame, where flags hang in the top-right middle ground. A pedestrian is visible walking in the right middle ground. The camera is positioned at eye level, maintaining a fixed perspective on the scenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This cityscape scenery shot captures a quiet, wet street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans. On the left, a large, white, lifted pickup truck is parked in the foreground, followed by a line of other cars, including a black sports car and a parked police car with red and blue lights flashing near its headlights. The buildings feature characteristic wrought-iron balconies with hanging plants, while on the right, a pedestrian walks towards the covered sidewalk, adding life to the scene. Flags hang from poles along the sidewalk, enhancing the unique architectural environment and the quiet, atmospheric quality of the overcast, foggy scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a foggy, overcast day, a narrow, wet street is lined with historic buildings featuring prominent wrought-iron balconies and support columns. A large, white, lifted pickup truck is parked on the left side of the road, with a black sports car and other vehicles queued behind it along the curb. On the right, several flags hang from the second-story balcony of a building with a sign for a gallery. The street, flanked by sidewalks and columns, recedes into the fog where a pedestrian is visible walking in the middleground.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good static overview, but it misses key dynamic details and could be more precise about the spatial relationships. For example, it states a pedestrian is \"visible walking\" but fails to describe their path; in the video, the person walks from the right middle ground toward the foreground before exiting the frame at the bottom right. The description of the flags as just \"hanging\" overlooks their distinct fluttering motion in the wind. Furthermore, the caption identifies the camera as \"eye level,\" but the perspective is clearly a high-angle shot, looking down on the roof of the pickup truck and the street. Finally, the description of the \"line of cars\" could be improved by specifying that they are stationary, which is a crucial detail about the scene's lack of vehicular movement, contrasting with the pedestrian and flag movements.",
