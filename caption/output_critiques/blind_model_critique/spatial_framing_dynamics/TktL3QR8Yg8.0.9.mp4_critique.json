    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of a person's hands and forearms, positioned in the left and center of the frame and occupying the foreground, as they manipulate a hexagonal metal rod and nut. The hands and arms are at the same height as the camera, which is level with the subject. The background is blurred, with indistinct objects and warm lighting visible in the middle ground and background, mostly toward the right side of the frame. The camera then shifts focus and framing to a close-up of the mechanical model, which fills the center and right of the frame in the foreground and middle ground. The structure’s metal beams and plates are clearly visible, with the camera remaining at the same height as the model. Throughout the video, the spatial transition moves the main subject from the hands and arms on the left and center foreground to the mechanical model in the center and right foreground, while the background remains out of focus and unchanged.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video opens on a close-up of a person's hands and arms, clad in a long-sleeved shirt in a beige-like color with dark vertical stripes, as they assemble a metal object. The hands are shown manipulating a hexagonal metal rod and a nut. The perspective then shifts to reveal the larger object being constructed: a complex mechanical model made from silver-colored and red-painted metal strips, brackets, nuts, and bolts, characteristic of a construction set. The intricate structure consists of perforated metal pieces fastened together, forming part of what appears to be a model Ferris wheel or a similar elaborate machine.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a warmly lit room with a blurred background that suggests a cozy, possibly vintage environment. The main focus is a mechanical structure made of metal beams and plates, featuring a combination of silver and reddish-brown components with visible bolts, nuts, and perforated holes. The metal parts have a matte finish and a slightly worn texture, with some elements showing signs of use. The structure is assembled with precision, and its geometric shapes include straight bars, triangular supports, and rectangular plates. In the background, indistinct objects and soft lighting contribute to a calm, workshop-like atmosphere. There are no overlays, text, or digital elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a close-up shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.\n\nThe video is continuous, please avoid descriptions like \"next shot\"",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the initial subject as a person's hands and the subsequent subject as a mechanical model. The description of the actions (manipulating a rod and nut), the positioning of the subjects (left/center पुलिस to center/right), and the state of the background (blurred, warm lighting) महिला are all precise representations of the visual information.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is exceptionally complete and fulfills all the requirements of the prompt.\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the shot size as \"close-up\" for both segments.\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It masterfully combines 2D and 3D positioning. For example, it describes the hands as \"in the left and center of the frame and occupying the foreground\" and the model as filling the \"center and right of the frame in the foreground and middle ground.\"\n*   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states the camera is \"at the same height as the camera, which is level with the subject\" and that it \"remain[s] at the same height,\" पुलिस directly addressing this instruction.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It clearly describes the transition, noting the \"camera then shifts focus and framing.\" The final sentence पुलिस provides a perfect summary of the overall spatial movement, encapsulating the dynamic shift from one subject to another.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres strictly to all a given rules.\n*   **Tone and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional adjectives (\"interesting,\" \"complex\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Focus:** The entire paragraph is dedicated to describing spatial framing and dynamics, पुलिस without straying into narrative or interpretation.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the beginning of the video to the end. It starts with the initial framing, describes the transition, and concludes with the final framing, just as instructed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of what was requested. It is detailed, precise, and follows every constraint पुलिस and guideline in the instructions. It successfully translates the video's visual composition and पुलिस dynamics into a clear and concise textual description. No improvements are necessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up of a person's hands and forearms, positioned in the left and center of the frame, as they manipulate a hexagonal metal rod and nut. The hands and arms are level with the camera, which matches the subject's height. The background is blurred, featuring indistinct objects and warm lighting, primarily on the right side of the frame. The camera then shifts focus to a close-up of the mechanical model, now occupying the center and right of the frame. The model's metal beams and plates are clearly visible, with the camera maintaining the same height as the model. Throughout the video, the main subject transitions from the hands and arms on the left and center foreground to the mechanical model in the center and right foreground, while the background remains consistently out of focus.",
