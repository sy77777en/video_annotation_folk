    "pre_caption": "This is a wide scenery shot with no single main subject, focusing instead on the expansive landscape. A golden-brown mountain ridge extends from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground, serving as the central path of movement. To the left of the ridge, a dark-water lake is situated in the middle ground. In the background, a range of snow-capped mountains occupies the center and right portions of the frame, set against a blue sky with white clouds at the top. The camera, positioned at a low aerial height, moves rapidly forward along the crest of the ridge, creating a significant motion blur effect in the immediate foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured from a fast-moving aerial perspective, flying low along the spine of a steep, golden-brown rocky ridge. To the left, a serene, dark-water lake is nestled at the base of the mountains, while in the distance, a majestic range of jagged, snow-capped peaks rises against a deep blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The video lacks a single main subject, as the sweeping camera motion and wide-angle view are intended to immerse the viewer in the vast scale and breathtaking beauty of the alpine environment itself. The focus is on the grandeur of the natural world rather than any specific object within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a high-speed flight along the sharp crest of a mountain ridge covered in golden-brown rocks. The rapid forward motion creates a blur in the immediate foreground. To the left of the ridge lies a calm, greenish-blue glacial lake nestled against the base of a large, barren, light-brown mountain. In the background, a dramatic range of jagged, rocky peaks, some covered with white snow and glaciers, stands out against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video, here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a wide scenery shot of a mountainous landscape. The descriptions of the elements—the \"golden-brown mountain ridge,\" the \"dark-water lake,\" the \"snow-capped mountains,\" and the \"blue sky with white clouds\"—are all factually correct. The spatial placement of each element is also described with precision.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully captures all the key spatial components and dynamics as required by the instructions. It details the shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of all major landscape features, the camera's height, and, most importantly, the rapid forward camera movement and the resulting motion blur. It leaves out no significant visual information related to framing and movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to all instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly begins by identifying the shot as a \"wide scenery shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Framing (2D & 3D):** It meticulously describes the position of each element. For example, the ridge is correctly placed in the \"bottom center foreground\" extending to the \"middle ground,\" the lake is on the \"left\" in the \"middle ground,\" and the mountains are in the \"background\" at the \"center and right.\"\n*   **Camera Height & Movement:** It accurately notes the \"low aerial height\" and the \"rapidly forward\" movement along the ridge, which is the central dynamic of the video.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and descriptive, forming a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives and speculative language, focusing purely on observable spatial facts.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions, providing a description that is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly aligned with the goal of describing spatial framing and dynamics.",
