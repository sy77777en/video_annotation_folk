    "pre_caption": "This video presents a scenery shot focused entirely on the surface of the ocean. In a close-up shot, the deep blue, choppy water fills the entire frame from a high-angle perspective, looking down. The undulating waves are visible across the foreground and middle ground, creating a continuous, textured pattern that shifts and ripples throughout the static shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a natural scenery shot of the open sea. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the vast, textured surface of the water, emphasizing the environment and atmosphere. The deep blue water is covered in a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves that gently rise and fall. A soft, purplish-pink light, likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame, reflects off the crests of the waves, creating a subtle contrast with the darker troughs and lending a serene quality to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A vast expanse of deep blue ocean water fills the frame, its surface textured with a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves. The water ripples and shifts constantly, with a soft, purplish light reflecting across the waves, suggesting the low light of either dawn or dusk. The view remains focused on the dynamic, undulating surface of the sea.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good, but with one minor issue regarding adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as the ocean surface and describes its state (\"choppy,\" \"undulating\").\n*   The spatial framing is described precisely: \"close-up shot,\" \"fills the entire frame\" (2D position), \"foreground and middle ground\" (3D depth), and \"high-angle perspective\" (camera height).\n*   The dynamics are also captured accurately by noting the water \"shifts and ripples\" within a \"static shot.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete. It successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions: shot size, 2D and 3D position, camera height, and spatial dynamics.\n*   It effectively describes a scenery shot without a main subject, focusing on the texture and movement within the frame as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption successfully uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or speculative language.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The caption begins with the introductory phrase, \"This video presents a scenery shot...\" The instructions explicitly state to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The description should start directly with the spatial analysis.\n\n**Revised Example (for illustration):**\nIn a static, high-angle close-up shot, the choppy, deep blue surface of the ocean fills the entire frame. The undulating waves are visible across the foreground and middle ground, creating a continuous, textured pattern that shifts and ripples.",
