    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a view down a narrow, paved alleyway. A building with a light green metal door, adorned with posters and graffiti, occupies the right foreground, alongside a sticker-covered drainpipe and a curtained window. A low concrete wall runs along the left foreground and middle ground. Beyond the wall, train tracks are visible in the middle ground, leading towards a distant cityscape with a domed building in the background center, all under a clear sky at the top of the frame. Subsequently, a pair of hands, clad in a black jacket, enters from the bottom of the frame, raising a black digital camera into the center foreground. The camera is aimed at the cityscape, and its screen, displaying this view, becomes the central focus, with the original background cityscape now visible around and above the camera. The perspective is consistently first-person, at eye level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a first-person perspective of someone standing in a narrow alleyway next to a building with a green metal door covered in posters and graffiti. A low concrete wall runs along the other side of the alley. Initially, the view looks down the alley towards a distant cityscape under a clear sky. Then, a pair of hands, belonging to a person wearing a black jacket, raises a black digital camera into the frame, aiming it towards the cityscape to take a picture. The camera's screen displays the cityscape view.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, navigates an urban walkway in Porto during clear daylight. The scene begins alongside a building with a light green facade marked by graffiti, various posters including a large colorful one and three smaller black-and-white dragon-themed prints, a sticker-covered drainpipe, and a curtained window. The view then moves along the surface paved with small square tiles, which is lined by a concrete barrier, to encompass train tracks below and the distant cityscape featuring a domed building, all under a clear blue sky with a few birds. Subsequently, two hands appear, raising a black digital camera to frame the urban panorama on its screen.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately inventories the scene's elements and their initial positions, it could better capture the video's dynamic nature and visual hierarchy. The initial shot, described as a static view, likely has a subtle handheld motion characteristic of a first-person perspective, which isn't mentioned. The description of the hands and camera entering the frame is somewhat generic; it misses the opportunity to describe the speed and path of this movement—for instance, if the camera is raised slowly and deliberately, creating a sense of anticipation. A crucial missing detail is the change in focus; when the digital camera is raised into the foreground, the depth of field would almost certainly shift, causing the background cityscape to become softly blurred while the camera and its screen become sharp and clear. The caption implies everything remains in focus. Furthermore, the shot size transition is not explicitly defined; the video begins with a wide shot of the alleyway and then transitions into a close-up on the digital camera, which becomes the new primary subject. Finally, the final position of the camera could be more precise; rather than just \"center foreground,\" it might be held in the lower-center of the frame, allowing a clearer view of its screen, with the hands anchoring it at the bottom edge.",
