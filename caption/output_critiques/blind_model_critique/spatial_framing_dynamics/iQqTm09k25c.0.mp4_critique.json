    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a static, subject-level camera position, frames a padel match from behind one team's side of the court. In the foreground, two players are positioned on the bottom left and bottom right of the frame. In the middle ground, their two opponents are positioned on the opposite side of a central net. The court occupies the lower half of the frame, enclosed by glass walls on the sides and in the background, with empty tiered seating visible behind the far wall. Throughout the sequence, all four players move dynamically forward and backward between the net and the rear of the court, as well as laterally within their respective sides, to engage in a continuous rally.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a padel match with four men on a court. On one side, a man in a black outfit with white accents is actively engaged in the game, holding a racket, and positioned next to him is his teammate, a man in a dark blue outfit with a cap. On the opposite side of the net, the opposing team consists of a man in a red shirt and black shorts, standing near the net and appearing focused, alongside his partner, a man in a white and gray patterned shirt and shorts, captured mid-jump, swinging his racket. The setting is an indoor sports facility with a green playing surface and transparent walls surrounding the court.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor sports setting, specifically a padel court, with a green playing surface enclosed by glass walls. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an indoor arena with artificial lighting. The background features tiered seating, which is currently unoccupied, indicating a venue designed for spectators. The court is marked with white lines, and the net divides the playing area. The players, dressed in athletic gear, are actively engaged in the game, with their movements suggesting dynamic play. The overall atmosphere is energetic, with the focus on the sporting action within the enclosed court.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"wide shot\" that encompasses the entire padel court. The description of the camera as \"static\" and at \"subject-level\" is correct. The spatial placement of the subjects and elements is precise: two players in the foreground at the bottom left and right, two opponents in the middle ground, the court in the lower half, and the glass walls and seating in the background. The description of the players' movement—forward, backward, and laterally during a rally—is an accurate representation of the action in a typical padel match video from this perspective.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and successfully addresses all the requirements of the instructions. It specifies the shot size, camera position (static), and height (subject-level). It thoroughly details the 2D (bottom left/right) and 3D (foreground, middle ground, background) positions of all key subjects and environmental elements. Crucially, it also describes the spatial dynamics by explaining how all four players move within the established frame throughout the video. It covers the initial setup and the continuous movement, fulfilling the requirement to describe any changes.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the provided instructions.\n*   **Focus:** It maintains a strict focus on spatial framing and dynamics, avoiding any narrative or emotional interpretation.\n*   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective English (\"positioned,\" \"occupies,\" \"move dynamically\") without any speculative (\"appears to be\") or subjective (\"exciting rally\") language.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph. It logically starts with the overall shot, moves to the specific positions of subjects and elements, and concludes with their movement, creating a clear and easy-to-follow description.\n*   **Detail:** It provides the required details for shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and movement for all relevant elements, as instructed.",
