    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot consistently frames a driver from the shoulders up, positioned in the center foreground. The car's A-pillar and side mirror are visible in the left foreground. Throughout the video, the camera remains static and at the subject's level. While the driver's face rapidly transforms, their position within the frame is unchanged. In the background, a road, trees, and distant hills scroll from right to left, indicating the vehicle is in motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A single subject is shown from the shoulders up, seated in a vehicle and wearing a light-colored collared shirt. Initially, the subject appears as a young boy with medium, wavy blond hair, which then transforms into a child with medium, straight blond hair. The face then morphs into a bald, pale-skinned creature with pointed ears, wide eyes, and a large, toothy grin. Next, it changes to resemble a sphynx cat with numerous wrinkles. Following this, it becomes a reptilian-like being with reddish-brown, wrinkled skin, dark, narrow eyes, and a snout. Finally, the subject appears as a young man with wavy, medium-length blond hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set from the driver's side of a moving convertible during the daytime. The vehicle travels along a paved road, with a background of green trees, distant rolling hills under a pale blue sky, and a wooden fence visible along the side of the road in the midground. Inside the car, the driver's face transforms rapidly while wearing a light-colored collared shirt.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a human driving a car, with the frame capturing from his shoulders to his head. Throughout the video, his face transforms, shifting between a human, a child, and non-human appearances.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's use of \"close-up\" might be inaccurate; a \"medium close-up\" would better describe a shot framed from the shoulders up. The driver is described as being in the \"center,\" but in the video, they are positioned slightly to the right of center, which creates a more balanced composition against the A-pillar on the left. The description of the mid-ground fence \"extend[ing] from the left to the right\" is misleading; in the video, the fence is not a static element but scrolls from left to right along with the background, consistent with the vehicle's motion. While the caption notes the driver's face transforms, it misses the accompanying spatial dynamic: these transformations include subtle, rapid tilts and turns of the head, meaning the subject's position is not entirely \"unchanged.\" Furthermore, the caption omits that as the trees in the background scroll past, they cast intermittent, moving shadows across the driver's face and the car's interior, adding a layer of depth. Finally, it fails to mention the sliver of the dashboard and the road ahead visible in the bottom-left foreground, which provides additional context for the vehicle's movement.",
