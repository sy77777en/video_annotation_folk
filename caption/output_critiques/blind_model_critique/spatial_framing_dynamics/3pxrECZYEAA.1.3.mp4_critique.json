    "pre_caption": "A stylized, animated heart is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground against a dark background. Numerous red and pink arteries and veins extend from the top of the heart, branching outwards across the upper portion of the frame. The camera maintains a static, straight-on view at the heart's height. While the heart's position within the frame remains fixed, it rhythmically contracts and expands in place, with the pace of its beating gradually accelerating throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a stylized, animated depiction of a human heart that is depicted as beating. The heart starts at a slow pace and gradually increases in speed as the video continues. It is bright pink with smooth, rounded surfaces and prominent, darker pink lines representing veins or arteries. Several tubular structures extend from the top, resembling blood vessels, and are also bright pink. The heart is centrally positioned, and its design is abstract, focusing on bold colors and simplified forms rather than realistic details.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized animation, a pink and magenta heart is centered against a dark, nearly black background. The heart, detailed with bold outlines, has numerous red and pink arteries and veins extending from its top and branching outwards. Throughout the scene, the heart beats rhythmically, contracting and expanding.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"stylized, animated heart\" and accurately describes its position (\"center of the frame\"), the surrounding elements (\"red and pink arteries and veins\"), the background (\"dark background\"), the camera's perspective (\"static, straight-on view at the heart's height\"), and the subject's movement (\"rhythmically contracts and expands... pace... gradually accelerating\"). All described details are present in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very thorough but has one notable omission. It successfully describes the subject's 2D position, 3D depth, the camera's height, and the spatial dynamics. However, it fails to explicitly state the **shot size** (e.g., medium shot, close-up) at the beginning, which is the first requirement in the instructions. While the description implies a close-up or medium shot, the instruction requires the term itself to be used.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions.\n*   **Strengths:** It provides a concise, single-paragraph description using simple, objective language. It effectively details the 2D position, 3D depth, camera height, and the dynamic changes in the subject's movement, all as requested. It avoids speculation and emotional language.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The primary deviation from the instructions is the failure to specify the shot size. The instructions clearly state, \"First, specify the shot size based on the subject's size in the frame.\" Adding this detail would make the caption fully compliant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is very good—it is accurate, well-written, and follows most of the complex instructions. Its only significant flaw is the omission of the shot size, a key requirement of the prompt.",
