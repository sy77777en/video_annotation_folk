    "pre_caption": "This video uses a wide shot, capturing the entirety of an isometric game room from a tilted overhead angle. A tall, winding structure is positioned in the center middle ground. An ornate archway stands on the left middle ground. The walls, featuring alcoves with static figures, define the background along the top and right edges of the frame. The checkered floor occupies the foreground and middle ground. A white, ghost-like figure begins near the central structure in the middle ground and moves towards the right middle ground. Two cone-shaped objects are initially seen near the center middle ground before moving towards the right middle ground. An orange and white cube is located in the bottom right middle ground. Game interface elements are overlaid across the bottom foreground. The camera position and framing remain fixed throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an isometric game environment with a distinct, limited color palette primarily featuring black, white, orange, and teal. A prominent, atypical structure dominates the center, constructed from stacked orange and white segments resembling a spine, crowned with arched details. The main character is a cartoon dog with large eyes and a simple, round form, adding a playful appeal to the scene. Static, green, masked figures stand within alcoves along the walls, appearing as stylized guards or statues. Animated, peculiar orange, cone-shaped objects with white bases and jagged tops move across the checkered floor. An ornate, striped archway serves as an entrance or exit on the left. An orange and white cube is situated in the right corner of the scene, adding to the environment's complexity. The scene's overall appearance is defined by its retro, pixelated graphic style and isometric perspective, creating a non-realistic, stylized world.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A third-person isometric (2.5D) gaming video with a tilted overhead angle shows an indoor room rendered in a pixelated style using orange, white, teal, and black. The environment features a black and teal checkered floor, with walls formed by tall bookshelves filled with white books and teal accents. Along the walls, small teal figures stand in front of the shelves, and orange highlights run throughout the architecture. A white and orange striped archway serves as an entrance on the left. A tall, winding orange and white structure dominates the center. Throughout the video, a cartoon white dog character moves across the room, starting near the central structure and heading right. Two orange and white cone-shaped objects appear, initially near the center and later near the right wall, moving aimlessly without any discernible pattern. Overlays forming a heads-up display (HUD) are visible at the bottom, showing icons for game items and corresponding numbers.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundational description, but it misses key dynamic interactions and contains some inaccuracies based on the video's content. Crucially, it fails to connect the movement of the subjects, describing the dog's and the cones' movements as separate events when the video clearly shows the dog actively pushing the two cones across the floor; this interaction is the central action of the scene. The description of the dog's path is also too general; it moves from the center, passes briefly behind the central structure creating a moment of occlusion, and then pushes the cones along a specific line on the checkered floor toward the right. Furthermore, the statement that the figures in the alcoves are \"static\" is incorrect, as the figure in the top right alcove subtly turns its head back and forth. Lastly, while the game interface is correctly placed in the foreground, the caption omits that a score counter within the interface at the bottom left dynamically increases as the dog successfully moves the cones.",
