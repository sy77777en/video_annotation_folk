    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot from a high, top-down perspective, an animated character lies in the center of the frame on the pavement, which occupies the middle ground. A fire hydrant is positioned in the top right of the frame, also in the middle ground. The scene is enclosed by two buildings on the left and right sides. White streaks representing rain begin to appear and move rapidly downwards through the frame, traveling from the foreground toward the middle ground, while the character and fire hydrant remain stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high, top-down perspective, an animated character with dark hair is seen lying on their side. The character is dressed in a dark, long coat with a high, pointed collar over a white shirt. The coat is spread out on the ground around them, creating a shape reminiscent of bat wings. A smaller, less distinct figure is bear the charcter, which is actually a fire hydrant.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows a high-angle, top-down view of a narrow, dark alley between two tall, gray buildings at night. The buildings, which feature simple rectangular windows and a fire escape on one side, have a stylized, hand-drawn appearance with visible line work. White streaks, representing heavy rain, fall rapidly through the scene, creating a sense of fast downward motion. On the dark pavement below, a figure is lying down.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the high, top-down perspective and the main subjects, but it could be more specific about the spatial relationships and the full impact of the camera's rotation. While it notes the 2D positions, it omits the 3D depth; for instance, the character and fire hydrant are on the same plane in the middle ground, with the pavement itself forming the base plane. The description of the camera's clockwise rotation is incomplete, as it only focuses on the fire hydrant's movement and neglects to mention that the character in the center rotates in place and the building on the left shifts toward the top of the frame. Furthermore, the caption misses key environmental details that add to the spatial composition, such as the yellow painted lines on the pavement that the character is lying across and a storm drain grate in the bottom right. Finally, describing the character's initial orientation (e.g., head pointing toward the top of the frame) and how that orientation changes with the camera's rotation would provide a more complete account of the subject's spatial dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a wide shot from a high, top-down perspective, an animated character lies in the center of the frame on the pavement, which forms the base plane in the middle ground. The character's head initially points toward the top of the frame. A fire hydrant is positioned in the top right of the frame, also on the same plane in the middle ground. The scene is enclosed by two buildings on the left and right sides. As the camera rotates clockwise, the character rotates in place, and the building on the left shifts toward the top of the frame. White streaks representing rain begin to appear and move rapidly downwards through the frame, traveling from the foreground toward the middle ground, while the character and fire hydrant remain stationary. The pavement features yellow painted lines that the character is lying across, and a storm drain grate is visible in the bottom right, adding to the spatial composition.",
