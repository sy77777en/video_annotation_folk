    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a diver standing in the foreground on the left side of the frame, positioned on a diving platform, with the camera at his level. In the background, spectators are seated on tiered benches. As the diver jumps, he moves from the left towards the center of the frame while descending. The camera pans right and tilts down to follow his movement. During the descent, the camera's position changes to a high-angle perspective, looking down from above the diver. He enters the water in the center of the frame, with the shot concluding from this overhead viewpoint.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man with light skin and short blond hair, wearing blue patterned swimming briefs. He is initially standing on a diving platform with his arms raised above his head, preparing to dive. The man is barefoot and has a black wristband on each wrist. The video captures his dive into a pool, culminating in a splash as he enters the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors at a swimming facility, featuring a diving platform and a pool. The setting includes a diving board with metal railings and a spectator area with tiered seating. The environment is well-lit, suggesting an artificial lighting setup typical of indoor sports venues. The pool water is a vibrant blue, with ripples and splashes indicating movement. The scene tracks a diver standing poised on the platform to their contact with the water, where a splash marks the entry. The overall atmosphere is focused on the diving activity, with the pool's surface and the structured seating area providing context.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the initial shot as a full shot and precisely describes the diver's starting position in the foreground on the left. The description of the diver's movement (from left to center, descending) and the corresponding camera movement (panning right and tilting down) is correct. The change in camera perspective from eye-level to a high-angle/overhead view is also accurately noted.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the required elements:\n*   **Shot Size:** \"full shot\" is specified at the beginning.\n*   **Position & Depth:** It clearly defines the 2D (left, center) and 3D (foreground, background) positions for both the main subject (diver) and secondary elements (spectators).\n*   **Camera Height & Movement:** It describes the initial camera level (\"at his level\"), the dynamic camera movements (\"pans right and tilts down\"), and the final camera angle (\"high-angle perspective\").\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It effectively explains the entire sequence of spatial changes for both the subject and the camera from the start of the jump to the entry into the water.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly adheres to all instructions.\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n*   It focuses exclusively on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n*   It clearly outlines the initial state, the transition, and the final state of the framing.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a well-written, accurate, and comprehensive description that perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the prompt.",
