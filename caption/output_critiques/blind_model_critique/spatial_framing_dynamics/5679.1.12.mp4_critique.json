    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of the man on the wooden bridge, capturing him from head to toe. He is positioned in the center of the frame, both in the 2D and 3D space, with the forest forming the background. The bridge occupies the middle ground, while the dense greenery fills the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a wide shot, maintaining the man's central position but now showing more of the surrounding forest and the length of the bridge. The camera remains at the subject's height throughout, keeping the man's gestures and movements clearly visible against the natural backdrop. The man's dynamic hand movements and slight shifts in stance are consistently framed within the center of the shot, emphasizing his actions against the static environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man standing on a wooden bridge in a forested area. He is wearing an orange jacket and a matching hat, with beige shorts and red shoes. The man has a deep brown skin tone. He is facing the camera, gesturing with his hands, and appears to be performing a form of dance. The lush greenery of the forest surrounds the bridge, providing a natural backdrop to the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor setting in a lush, dense forest with towering evergreen trees and rich green foliage. The scene is set during the day, with natural light filtering through the canopy, creating a serene and vibrant atmosphere. A wooden bridge, weathered and covered with patches of moss, spans the foreground, adding a rustic element to the environment. The bridge's railings are simple and functional, blending with the natural surroundings. The ground is scattered with fallen leaves, hinting at a recent rain or the onset of autumn. The overall scene is tranquil, with the forest's natural beauty and the bridge's earthy tones harmonizing seamlessly.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the shot's change from a full shot to a wide shot is vague, failing to specify if it's a slow zoom-out or a dolly-out, which is a critical detail for understanding the spatial dynamics. The caption's placement of the entire bridge in the middle ground is an oversimplification; the bridge likely functions as a leading line, originating in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and extending into the middle ground, guiding the viewer's eye to the man. Furthermore, the description of the man's movement as \"slight shifts\" is too general; if he turns to gesture at the forest, this changes his orientation from a frontal to a profile view, a significant spatial shift that is not mentioned. Finally, labeling the environment as \"static\" is a missed opportunity, as it ignores subtle movements like a stream flowing below the bridge in the foreground or leaves rustling in the wind, which would add a layer of dynamic contrast to the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a full shot of the man standing on a wooden bridge, captured from head to toe and positioned centrally in both 2D and 3D space, with a lush forest as the backdrop. The bridge serves as a leading line, starting in the foreground at the bottom of the frame and extending into the middle ground, naturally guiding the viewer's eye to the man. As the video progresses, the shot transitions through a slow zoom-out, revealing more of the surrounding forest and the full length of the bridge while maintaining the man's central position. The camera remains at the subject's height, ensuring his gestures and movements are clearly visible against the dynamic natural backdrop. The man's movements include turning to gesture at the forest, shifting his orientation from a frontal to a profile view, which is a significant spatial change. The environment, while providing a static visual contrast, is animated by subtle movements such as a stream flowing below the bridge and leaves rustling in the wind, adding a layer of dynamic contrast to the scene.",
