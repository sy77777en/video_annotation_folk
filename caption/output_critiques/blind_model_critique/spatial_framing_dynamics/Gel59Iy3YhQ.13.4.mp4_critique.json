    "pre_caption": "The video is presented from a first-person perspective in a continuous wide shot, capturing a stylized desert environment. Initially, a massive canyon wall occupies the entire left side of the frame. A sandy path with a dark green cable runs from the bottom center foreground into the middle ground. On the right, rock formations and a body of water are situated in the middle ground and background. A building is first seen in the background, to the right of the center. The camera moves forward at a steady pace, following the path. This movement brings the building from the background into the middle ground, making it the central focus of the scene. The canyon wall remains a constant element on the left, while the rock formations and water on the right shift in perspective as the camera advances. The camera's height is consistently at eye level, simulating a character's view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a first-person perspective moving through a stylized desert canyon. The environment is composed of large, smooth, orange-brown rock formations, some of which rise as blocky pillars from a body of still, blue water on the right. A sandy path, marked by a continuous dark green cable, runs along the base of a massive canyon wall on the left. Scattered throughout the scene are small, bright green, low-poly bushes. As the perspective advances, a building becomes the central focus. It is a wooden structure with a reddish-brown roof, exposed beams, and partially open walls, situated on a rocky outcrop. A small, square window with a blue frame is visible on one of its orange-colored walls.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, follows a dark cable along a narrow, sandy path within a stylized desert canyon. On the left, a sheer orange rock wall rises, while on the right, jagged rock formations border a calm body of blue water that reflects the scenery. The path, dotted with small, bright green bushes, leads toward a partially constructed building with a wooden frame and a red roof, all set under a clear blue sky.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a first-person perspective of a game character walking through a stylized desert-like environment in a game. It maintains a wide shot to capture the surrounding terrain, including rock formations, vegetation, and finally a house. The camera moves forward along a narrow path beside a body of water, with the environment unfolding naturally as the character progresses.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate, very complete, and closely follows the instructions. It successfully describes the spatial framing and dynamics in a clear, concise paragraph.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key elements (canyon wall, path, cable, building, rock formations, water) and their spatial relationships. The description of the camera's forward movement and the resulting change in the building's position from background to middle ground is precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and addresses all the required components from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"continuous wide shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D and 3D):** It effectively uses terms like \"left side,\" \"bottom center,\" \"right,\" \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" and \"background\" to map out the scene.\n*   **Depth:** The concept of depth is well-explained, especially in describing the path running from foreground to middle ground and the building moving from background to middle ground.\n*   **Height:** It correctly states the camera height is \"consistently at eye level.\"\n*   **Changes/Dynamics:** The forward camera movement and the resulting perspective shifts are clearly described, fulfilling the core requirement to capture spatial dynamics.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres very well to the stylistic and content rules, with only minor points for improvement:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English.\n    *   It avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and focuses on what is visible.\n    *   It successfully describes the initial state, the movement, and the resulting changes in framing.\n\n*   **Minor Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses \"stylized\" and \"massive.\" \"Stylized\" describes the art style, which is an interpretation beyond pure spatial description. \"Massive\" is a subjective descriptor of size. Removing them would make the caption more objective (e.g., \"a desert environment,\" \"a canyon wall\").\n    *   **Interpretive Phrasing:** Phrases like \"first-person perspective\" and \"simulating a character's view\" are interpretations of the camera's role rather than a direct description of its physical properties. While effective, a more literal description would be \"The video is presented from an eye-level perspective...\" This is a very fine point, and the current phrasing is clear and understandable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is of high quality and effectively fulfills the prompt's requirements. The minor points regarding subjective adjectives and interpretive phrasing are subtle and do not detract significantly from its overall excellence. It is a great example of how to apply the given instructions.",
