    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot capturing a river landscape. The river flows from the middle ground near the top right, meandering towards the bottom center/right foreground. Dense green trees and bushes dominate the left foreground and middle ground. The right foreground and middle ground consist of sandy banks and patches of grass. A densely wooded hillside occupies the background across the upper portion of the frame. The camera maintains a static position, slightly elevated relative to the river level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot, focusing on a serene natural environment. It captures a tranquil river meandering through a lush, green area with dense foliage and scattered trees. The atmosphere is calm, with soft lighting suggesting early morning or late afternoon. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the peaceful ambiance, rather than any specific object or subject. The presence of animals, such as elephants, adds to the natural setting but does not dominate the scene, allowing the viewer to appreciate the scale and beauty of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a serene, natural environment during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon, characterized by soft, diffused lighting. The scene features a tranquil river meandering through a lush landscape, bordered by dense greenery and trees with varied foliage. On the left side of the riverbank, trees are positioned closer to the camera, adding to the depth of the scene. The river's surface reflects the muted sky, creating a gentle contrast with the surrounding earthy tones. The terrain is slightly uneven, with patches of grass and sandy banks. In the background, a line of trees and shrubs further enhances the scene's depth, while a few animals are visible near the water, blending harmoniously with the environment. The overall atmosphere is calm and undisturbed, with no visible human presence or structures.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general composition, but it could be more precise about the scene's dynamics and specific features. While it correctly identifies the shot as static, it fails to describe the movement within the frame, such as the visible, slow-moving current of the river creating gentle ripples in the foreground or the subtle swaying of the tree branches in the background. The term \"extreme wide shot\" might be an overstatement; if the river and its banks fill a significant portion of the frame, \"wide shot\" would be more appropriate. The description of the right bank is generic; it misses a prominent, light-gray, flat-topped rock in the right middle ground that juts out into the water. Furthermore, the description of the camera as \"slightly elevated\" is ambiguous; a more accurate term would be a \"high-angle shot,\" as the camera is positioned significantly above the landscape, looking down from a vantage point on the hillside, which enhances the sense of depth and the meandering path of the river.",
