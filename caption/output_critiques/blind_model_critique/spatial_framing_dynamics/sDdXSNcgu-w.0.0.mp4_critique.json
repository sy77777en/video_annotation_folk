    "pre_caption": "A single, black-and-white line drawing remains consistently positioned in the center of the frame against a plain white background. The drawing undergoes a continuous series of transformations, morphing from one character to another while maintaining its central position and relative size. The sequence begins with a stylized human figure, which then transforms into a cat, a character in a spacesuit, a dinosaur, a skeleton, a horned figure, a flower with a face, and a plant-like creature. The final transformation shows the plant-like creature reassembling into the initial stylized human figure, concluding the sequence in the same central location where it began. The entire animation is presented from a direct, head-on perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A sequence of simple, black-and-white line drawings appears against a plain white background. The first is a stylized human figure with a round head, slanted eyebrows, and a straight mouth, giving it an angry expression. This is followed by a drawing of a sitting cat with pointed ears and a small smile. Next, a character resembling a crewmate from the game *Among Us* is shown, with its characteristic bean-like shape and large oval visor. Subsequently, a cartoonish Tyrannosaurus Rex appears, depicted with a large head, sharp teeth, and small arms. This is followed by a drawing of a short, grinning skeleton wearing a hooded jacket with its hands in the pockets. After that, a small, cloaked figure with a horned head and large, black, circular eyes is displayed. Then, a flower with a wide, sinister grin and black eyes in its center is shown. The final distinct character is a plant-like creature with a large, toothed mouth and wide eyes, which splits apart and then reassembles to transform back into the initial stylized human figure with a round head, slanted eyebrows, and a straight mouth, conveying an angry expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a plain white background, a sequence of simple, black-and-white line drawings continuously morphs from one form to another. The animation features a series of characters, including a stick figure, a cat, a small character in a spacesuit, a dinosaur, a skeleton in a jacket, a horned knight, and a flower with a face, each seamlessly transforming into the next. The entire scene is minimalist, with only the black outlines of the characters visible against the featureless white expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the sequence of transformations and the drawing's consistent central placement, but it oversimplifies the spatial dynamics by stating the drawing maintains its \"relative size.\" In the video, the dimensions of the drawing fluctuate significantly; for example, when the figure morphs into the dinosaur, its form stretches vertically, occupying more of the upper half of the frame, while the transformation into the plant-like creature causes the drawing to widen at its base, shifting the visual weight toward the bottom-center. The description also misses the opportunity to detail the nature of the morphing itself—it could specify that the lines fluidly stretch, bend, and retract into new shapes rather than just stating a transformation occurs. Furthermore, while the drawing's overall mass stays centered, the primary focal point shifts within the frame; the flower's face, for example, sits slightly higher in the composition than the cat's body did. Lastly, the caption should explicitly define the shot size, which is a static medium shot, framed with enough surrounding white space to contain even the largest of the transformations, like the horned figure, without touching the frame's edges.",
