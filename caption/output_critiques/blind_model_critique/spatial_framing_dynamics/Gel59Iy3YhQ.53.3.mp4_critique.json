    "pre_caption": "This extreme wide shot, captured from a high angle, initially frames a small character in the middle ground, positioned slightly to the right of the frame's center on a winding mountain path. The large, purple mountain dominates the scene, positioned centrally. In the foreground, a row of feather icons is located in the bottom-left corner, and a compass is in the top-right. As the character walks up the path toward the upper-left, the camera pans left and tilts up to follow them. This movement keeps the character in the middle ground while shifting their position from the right-center to the upper-left of the frame, revealing more of the mountain's left face. The foreground UI elements remain fixed in their respective corners throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a pixel art style, a small character with blue hair, a red top, and blue pants is actively walking up a snowy path winding up a large, purple, rocky mountain. The mountain is covered in patches of white snow, with a few small, green, pixelated pine trees dotted along its ledges. In the bottom-left corner, a user interface displays a row of four yellow feathers next to five light-blue feathers. A small compass with a red needle pointing north is located in the top-right corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video with a pixelated art style, the scene is set on a steep, snowy mountain during the day. The mountain face is a distinct purple color, with white snow covering various ledges and winding paths where a few small, green pine trees grow. White, pixelated snowflakes fall continuously across the landscape as a small character navigates a path up the side of the cliff. An overlay in the bottom-left corner displays a heads-up display with a row of four golden and five blue feather icons. In the top-right corner, another overlay shows a small compass with a red needle.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the extreme wide shot and the initial positioning of the character and mountain. However, it could be more precise about the scene's depth and the dynamics of the camera movement. For instance, in an extreme wide shot, there is likely a foreground element, such as a rocky outcrop or some windswept trees, that the camera moves past, creating a parallax effect that isn't mentioned. The description of the camera \"dynamically adjusting its distance\" is ambiguous; specifying whether this is a dolly-out or a zoom-out would be clearer, as a dolly would alter the spatial relationship between the foreground, middle ground, and background. Furthermore, while the caption notes the character moves toward the upper-right, it omits a key spatial detail: the character would likely appear to shrink in size as they ascend and move deeper into the scene, a change in scale that is important to the shot's dynamic. Lastly, stating the compass overlay \"stays fixed\" is potentially inaccurate; while its position in the top-right corner is fixed, the compass needle itself would logically rotate to reflect the camera's counterclockwise arc, which is a missed detail of on-screen movement.",
