    "pre_caption": "A full shot shows a document positioned in the center foreground against a white background wall. The document features a black-and-white line drawing in its top half and a dark photograph in its bottom half. A thin red line is visible in the background, running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, passing behind the central document. The camera remains static, maintaining a straight-on angle relative to the document.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A black-and-white line drawing of a fragmented shipwreck is positioned above a dark, monochrome photograph. The drawing illustrates a large, complex piece of machinery, possibly a submarine, with a central, tower-like structure and scattered debris. Below it, the photograph shows what appears to be the same wreck submerged in a dark, murky environment. The metallic structure in the photo is heavily damaged and partially obscured by shadows and what looks like sediment, illuminated by a single light source, corresponding to the layout in the technical drawing above. The image primarily features dark gray tones with only a slight hint of green.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A document is displayed against a white wall, framed by a thin red diagonal line that changes its angle slightly as it passes behind the document. The document features two images arranged vertically. The top image is a black-and-white line drawing depicting the wreckage of a vessel, possibly a submarine. Below it is a dark, grainy, greenish photograph that appears to be an underwater image of the same wreckage. A very small, barely visible white logo is in the lower left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The use of \"full shot\" is inaccurate for an object; a \"medium close-up\" would be more appropriate as the document and a small portion of the surrounding wall are visible. The description of the document's content, such as the line drawing and photograph, is superfluous detail that distracts from the primary goal of describing spatial dynamics. The most significant error is the statement that the red line \"passes behind the document.\" Visually, the red line is clearly positioned in the foreground, stretched in front of the document which is in the middle ground against the background wall. The caption misinterprets the spatial depth. The camera's arcing motion creates a parallax effect, causing the foreground line to shift its apparent position against the middle-ground document, which is what the caption confusingly describes as the line \"altering its angle.\" A more accurate description would state that the camera arcs from a left-of-center, angular view to a frontal position, causing the foreground red line to move from right to left across the face of the document.",
