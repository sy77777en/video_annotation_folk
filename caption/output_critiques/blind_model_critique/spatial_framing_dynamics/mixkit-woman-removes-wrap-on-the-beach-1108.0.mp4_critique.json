    "pre_caption": "A medium shot captures a woman positioned in the center of the frame, standing in the foreground on a sandy surface. A large, dark rock formation occupies the background. She unties a blue and white patterned sarong from her waist and holds it out with both hands. She then begins to walk forward and turn, moving from the center towards the right of the frame as the sarong billows behind her. The camera, positioned at her level, follows her movement, keeping her as the central focus while she moves across the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with lightly tanned skin and shoulder-length, wavy, blonde-highlighted hair stands in the video. She is wearing a black one-piece swimsuit with a square neckline, accessorized with large hoop earrings, multiple necklaces including a choker and a longer lariat-style one, and several bracelets on both wrists. A small tattoo is visible on her upper right arm. Initially, she has a blue and white patterned sarong tied around her waist, which she then unties and holds out behind her with both hands, letting it billow as she turns and walks forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors during the day at a sandy location at the base of a large, dark rock formation. The rock wall is craggy and textured, with deep shadows cast by the bright sunlight. A woman in a black swimsuit stands on the sand. She holds a large, blue and white patterned cloth, which billows in the wind as she moves in front of the rocky backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and her primary action, but it contains contradictions and lacks spatial precision. It states the camera keeps the woman as the \"central focus\" while she simultaneously moves \"towards the right of the frame\"; it should clarify if the camera pans to keep her centered or if she is intentionally framed on the right to show her path of movement. The description of depth could be improved; placing her in the \"foreground\" feels flat, whereas positioning her in the middle ground, with the sand extending into the immediate foreground, would create a more layered composition. The background is vaguely described as a \"rock formation\"; a more specific description, such as \"a rock formation spanning the upper left background with the sky visible on the right,\" would be more informative. The phrase \"walks forward and turn\" is ambiguous; it's unclear if she moves toward the camera (which would change the shot size from a medium shot to a medium close-up) or parallel to it. A more accurate description might be that she walks diagonally from the center-middle ground toward the right-foreground. Finally, the caption misses key spatial elements like the long shadow she casts on the sand to the left, which would help define the lighting and add depth to the scene.",
