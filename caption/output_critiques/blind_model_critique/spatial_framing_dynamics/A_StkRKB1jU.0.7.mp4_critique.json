    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a medium shot showing a man in a clown mask in the foreground on the right, with a second masked man visible in the middle ground through a central doorway. As the men run forward, the camera follows them, and the shot transitions to a full shot. In this new framing, the men are seen running away from the camera down a long corridor. One man runs in the center, moving from the foreground toward the middle ground, while a second man runs to his right, also receding into the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three men wearing clown masks and dark blue clothing are seen running. The first man, positioned more to the left, wears a clown mask with red paint around the mouth, a red nose, blue paint around the eyes, and is dressed in a dark blue jacket. A second man, initially behind the first, also wears a similar clown mask and dark blue clothing. A third man, also in a clown mask and dark blue attire, is briefly visible running and carrying a blue bag.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene unfolds within a long indoor corridor, characterized by light-colored walls. The floor is smooth, light-colored, and highly reflective. Bright, even illumination fills the space, supplemented by light from windows visible in the background. Figures are observed moving swiftly through this corridor.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good structural overview, but it could be more precise about the subjects' spatial relationships and the camera's dynamics. The description of the second man as \"obscured\" is vague; in the video, he is partially visible, peering over the first man's left shoulder, making the initial composition feel more crowded and tense. The phrase \"the shot transitions to a full shot\" is slightly misleading, as it is not a cut but a continuous, dynamic reframing; a more accurate description would be that the camera, which is handheld and shaky, pulls back while running, causing the shot to naturally widen from a medium-close-up to a full shot. Furthermore, the men do not run \"sequentially\" but rather in a chaotic cluster, jostling for position as they recede down the dimly lit, narrow corridor. The initial framing also places the clown-masked man slightly left of center, not perfectly centered, which unbalances the frame and adds to the scene's disorienting feel.",
