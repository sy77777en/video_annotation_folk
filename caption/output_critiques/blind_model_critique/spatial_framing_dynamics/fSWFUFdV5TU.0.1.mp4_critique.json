    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a cluttered kitchen counter, filmed from the subjects' level. A black coffee maker occupies the center-left of the frame in the middle ground, with a black dish rack to its right. In the background, a window spans the top of the frame, with several small bottles resting on its sill in the top-right. The foreground is filled with various items: a slice of bread is in the bottom-left, while a sliced orange bell pepper and a plastic bag are in the bottom-right. The scene remains static until an egg is thrown from off-screen, striking and splattering across the left pane of the window in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a cluttered kitchen countertop with various items. A black coffee maker is positioned prominently, surrounded by a disorganized array of objects. On the counter, there is a sliced orange bell pepper, a plastic bag, and a thick slice of bread. A bottle and a few small containers are visible on the window sill, suggesting a mix of food preparation and storage items. Around the midway point, an egg hits the window, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The overall setting conveys a sense of everyday kitchen activity with items left out in a casual, unarranged manner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a dimly lit kitchen setting, characterized by a cluttered countertop with various items such as a coffee maker, a sliced bell pepper, and scattered food remnants. A small window above the counter allows soft, natural light to filter in, highlighting dust particles in the air. The window sill holds several small containers, possibly spice jars or medicine bottles. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, early morning or late afternoon, with a sense of stillness and neglect. The scene remains consistent throughout, emphasizing the untidy and lived-in nature of the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and successfully adheres to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the shot size as a \"wide shot\" and the camera height as \"subjects' level.\"\n*   The spatial positioning of all described elements is correct. The coffee maker is center-left in the middle ground, the dish rack is to its right, the window is in the background, the bottles are top-right, and the foreground items (bread, pepper, bag) are correctly placed.\n*   The description of the dynamic event—the egg entering from off-screen and splattering on the background window—is precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is comprehensive, covering shot size, 2D position (left, right, top, bottom), 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and camera height.\n*   It effectively breaks down the cluttered scene into distinct elements and their specific locations, providing a clear spatial map for the viewer.\n*   It correctly notes the transition from a static scene to a dynamic one, detailing the movement and its impact point.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, objective, and natural English, avoiding emotional adjectives or speculative language.\n*   It follows the specified structure by starting with the shot size and camera height, then detailing the spatial arrangement of static elements, and concluding with the spatial dynamics of the moving element.\n*   It successfully describes both the 2D position within the frame and the 3D position within the scene for multiple elements, as required.",
