    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from a first-person point-of-view, with the scene framed by a dark, rounded visor in the extreme foreground. The camera moves forward and slightly to the right through a dense, underwater environment. Initially, a large, trunk-like structure with glowing pink and green elements dominates the left foreground. Numerous similar structures populate the middle ground and background across the entire frame, creating a sense of depth. A large school of small, glowing creatures swims in the upper-left and central middle ground. As the camera advances, the foreground structure on the left moves past, and the viewer glides between the formations that were previously in the middle ground. Smaller, blue, ray-like creatures can be seen swimming in the lower middle ground and background, near the seabed at the bottom of the frame. The camera's perspective is at a mid-level height within the environment, looking slightly up at the tops of the structures and down towards the seafloor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents an underwater, alien-like environment from a first-person perspective, viewed through a diving mask, which is represented by a dark, rounded border. The scene is dominated by numerous tall structures that resemble giant green-grey trunks. These structures feature broad, flat, disc-shaped tops with a dark blue upper surface and a reddish-orange stippled underside. The trunks emit glowing greenish lights from small areas around them, and some have bright pink, ring-like spots, fuchsia-colored dots, and small, glowing green bumps. Swimming through the murky teal water among these formations are large schools of small, silvery, glowing, fish-like creatures and a few bright blue manta rays.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through a diver's eyes, moves through a fantastical underwater forest in murky, teal-colored water. The environment is populated by tall, stalk-like structures in green and brown hues, topped with flat, disc-shaped caps that have dark-blue tops and reddish-orange undersides. Additional structures grow on these stalks, including small pink rings, purple dots, and bioluminescent protrusions, with some areas emitting light. A school of small, silvery, bioluminescent fish-like creatures swims through the scene, accompanied by bioluminescent blue manta rays visible at the bottom. The entire scene is presented through a dark, rounded frame, like a helmet visor, with the bottom edge showing part of the visor. The seabed features sandy areas, green plants, and dark plants.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively establishes the first-person perspective and the general movement through the scene, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and visual details. The description of the visor as being in the \"extreme foreground\" is good, but it omits whether the visor is a static overlay or if it has subtle movements, like a head-bob, that would ground the POV. The caption also fails to specify the shot size, which appears to be a wide shot from the described elements. The description of the \"large, trunk-like structure\" could be improved by quantifying how much of the left foreground it initially occupies, for instance, if it covers the entire left third of the frame. Furthermore, the path of the small, glowing creatures could be detailed more interactively; for example, specifying that they swarm past the camera, momentarily filling the upper-left quadrant and enhancing the sense of immersion. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the quality of the light; it mentions glowing elements but doesn't clarify if the scene is otherwise dark, relying solely on bioluminescence, or if there is ambient light filtering down from above, which would significantly affect the perception of depth and space. Finally, the camera's movement is described as a simple forward and right motion, but a more nuanced description could include any subtle changes in speed or slight vertical drifts that would make the underwater glide feel more natural.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is presented from a first-person point-of-view, framed by a dark, rounded visor in the extreme foreground, which subtly moves with a gentle head-bob, enhancing the immersive experience. The scene unfolds in a wide shot as the camera glides forward and slightly to the right through a dense, underwater environment. Initially, a large, trunk-like structure with glowing pink and green elements occupies the entire left third of the frame. Numerous similar structures populate the middle ground and background, creating a rich sense of depth. A large school of small, glowing creatures swarms past the camera, momentarily filling the upper-left quadrant and central middle ground, enhancing the sense of immersion. As the camera advances, the foreground structure on the left moves past, allowing the viewer to glide between formations that were previously in the middle ground. Smaller, blue, ray-like creatures swim gracefully in the lower middle ground and background, near the seabed at the bottom of the frame. The environment is illuminated by bioluminescence, with ambient light filtering down from above, adding depth and dimension to the scene.
