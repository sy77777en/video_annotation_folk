    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of the subjects, capturing them from the waist up. The main character, a man, is positioned in the foreground and center of the frame, actively engaging with objects on a table directly in front of him. His 2D position is central, while his 3D position places him in the foreground. The table, with various items such as bottles and containers, is also in the foreground, slightly below the man. Another character, a woman, is initially in the background, positioned towards the right side of the frame. Her 2D position shifts as she stands up and turns sideways, moving slightly towards the center-right. Her 3D position remains in the background throughout. The camera maintains a level height relative to the subjects, keeping both characters within the frame consistently. The background includes a cluttered workshop environment with tools and hanging items, which remain static throughout the sequence. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera movement, maintaining a steady focus on the interaction between the man and the surrounding objects, as well as the woman's subtle repositioning.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a claymation scene with two characters. The main character is a man with a medium skin tone, curly dark hair, and a prominent mustache. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeved, striped shirt and is positioned at a table, interacting with objects in front of him. His expression is neutral, and he appears focused on his task. In the background, another character, a woman with a medium skin tone and dark hair, is visible. She is dressed in a bright orange outer garment with a dark blue inner garment. She stands up and turns sideways, revealing her upper body and facial features. The setting suggests a workshop or kitchen environment, with various items around them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, rustic atmosphere. The environment features a cluttered workspace with various tools and materials, suggesting a workshop or craft area. The lighting is soft and ambient, casting gentle shadows that enhance the cozy feel of the space. Notable visual elements include a wooden table with a textured surface, scattered with small objects and containers. The walls are adorned with hanging items, adding to the sense of a busy, lived-in space. The color palette consists of earthy tones, with browns and greens dominating the scene. The presence of figures engaged in activity adds a dynamic element, contributing to the overall impression of a bustling, creative environment.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas where it could be improved to better align with the specific instructions.\n\n### Analysis of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately applies the requested terminology (medium shot, foreground/background, center/right, level height).\n*   The description of the scene is spatially logical and coherent, detailing the relative positions of two characters and key objects.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** \"medium shot... from the waist up.\"\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D/3D):** It correctly identifies the 2D (center, right) and 3D (foreground, background) positions for the man, the woman, and the table.\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"level height relative to the subjects.\"\n    *   **Changes/Dynamics:** It effectively describes the woman's movement (\"stands up and turns sideways, moving slightly towards the center-right\") and confirms the static nature of the camera and background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has some minor but notable deviations from the rules.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   It correctly begins with the shot size.\n*   It clearly distinguishes between 2D and 3D space for multiple subjects.\n*   It successfully describes a spatial change (the woman's movement) and a lack of change (static camera).\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1.  **Redundancy:** The caption is not as concise as it could be. The sentence, \"His 2D position is central, while his 3D position places him in the foreground,\" is entirely redundant, as this information was stated in the preceding sentence. This violates the \"concise\" instruction.\n2.  **Subjective/Interpretive Language:** The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption includes several:\n    *   \"**actively** engaging\": This describes the quality of the man's action, which is interpretive.\n    *   \"**cluttered** workshop\": \"Cluttered\" is a subjective judgment. A more neutral description would be \"a workshop environment with tools.\"\n    *   \"**subtle** repositioning\": \"Subtle\" is an interpretation of the movement's significance.\n3.  **Describing Intent/Focus:** The final sentence, \"...maintaining a steady focus on the interaction between the man and the surrounding objects,\" describes the *purpose* or *effect* of the shot rather than the objective spatial framing itself. The word \"interaction\" is also interpretive. The instructions ask for a description of the framing, not an analysis of the director's intent.\n4.  **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video presents a...\", which could be considered introductory text, violating the rule to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it demonstrates a strong understanding of the core task and includes all the necessary spatial information. However, it is not a *perfect* caption according to the strict rules provided. To be fully compliant, it would need to be more concise by removing redundant sentences and more objective by eliminating subjective adjectives and interpretive phrases.",
