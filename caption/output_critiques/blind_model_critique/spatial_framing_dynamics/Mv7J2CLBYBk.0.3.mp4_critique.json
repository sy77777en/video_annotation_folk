    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot filmed at the subjects' level, a man is initially positioned in the center-middle ground, balanced on the handrails of two parallel moving walkways that stretch from the foreground. A woman stands on the left walkway, positioned in the center-left middle ground. The man moves from left to right across the frame, performing an acrobatic jump over a metal divider located in the center of the walkways. He lands on the floor in the right-middle ground, where two other women are visible in the background. The camera remains stationary throughout the action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of the video is a man performing an acrobatic maneuver in an airport terminal. He is wearing a black jacket with white stripes on the sleeves, black leggings, black sneakers, and a grey baseball cap. He is seen riding the inner handrails of two moving walkways, with one foot on each, as he glides forward through the terminal. On the adjacent walkway stands a woman with long, dark hair, wearing a beige jacket. In the background, another woman with dark, curly hair, wearing a black and white patterned coat, pulls a purple suitcase, while a blonde woman stands nearby.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside a brightly lit, modern airport terminal with a high, tiled ceiling and a polished, reflective floor. A glass-and-metal moving walkway runs through the center of the spacious hall. In the middle ground, a plain white wall features a grey door. Rows of airport seating are visible near large windows. A few travelers are scattered throughout the area, with one person standing on the moving walkway and another with a luggage cart positioned at the end of the walkway.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and effectively adheres to most of the instructions, but it has one minor inaccuracy and a small omission.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"wide shot,\" the camera height as \"at the subjects' level,\" and the camera movement as \"stationary.\"\n*   It accurately places the subjects and elements in the scene, such as the man in the \"center-middle ground,\" the woman in the \"center-left middle ground,\" and the walkways stretching from the \"foreground.\"\n*   **Inaccuracy:** The description of the man's movement as \"from left to right across the frame\" is incorrect. The man starts in the **center** of the frame and moves to the **right**, landing in the right-middle ground. His movement is not across the entire frame from left to right.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is quite complete, covering the main subject's action, the presence of secondary subjects, and key environmental elements.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption states the woman \"stands on the left walkway\" but does not mention that she is simultaneously moving toward the foreground on the walkway. While not a major detail, including this would provide a more complete picture of the spatial dynamics.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Structure and Content:** The caption successfully follows the required structure. It begins with the shot size, describes the spatial framing (2D and 3D positions) of the subjects, details the spatial movement, and correctly notes the camera's stability.\n*   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective English as instructed, avoiding emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that highlights the essential details without being overly verbose.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent but could be perfected by correcting the description of the man's movement from \"left to right\" to \"center to right\" and by adding the detail of the woman's movement on the walkway.",
