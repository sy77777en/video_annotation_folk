    "pre_caption": "In an extreme close-up, high-angle shot, a central cluster of ants and sugar crystals occupies the foreground in the center of the frame. A few individual ants and scattered sugar crystals are also visible around this main group, extending toward the bottom left and bottom right. The entire scene is set on a flat, cracked, blue-grey surface. While the spatial framing of the subjects remains static, the camera's focus shifts dynamically; it begins slightly blurry, comes into sharp focus, blurs completely, and then refocuses clearly on the central group of ants and sugar.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows a cluster of small, reddish-brown ants with darker or black abdomens crawling over and around a pile of small, clear, irregularly shaped sugar crystals. The ants and sugar are on a blue-grey, slightly cracked surface. The camera briefly goes out of focus before refocusing on the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a close-up view, a group of small, reddish-brown ants moves around a small pile of clear, crystalline sugar granules. The scene takes place on a flat, blue-gray surface that has a rough texture and visible cracks. The ants are actively crawling on and around the sugar crystals. Throughout the video, the focus shifts, alternating between a blurry and a clear perspective of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the initial shot size and camera angle but completely overlooks the movement of the ants themselves, which is a primary element of the video's spatial dynamics. It fails to describe how the ants are actively crawling over the sugar pile, carrying crystals away, or moving from the periphery toward the central cluster. The description of the central cluster occupying \"both the foreground and midground\" is spatially confusing; it would be more accurate to place the main pile in the midground and describe specific individual ants moving in the immediate foreground, creating a clearer sense of depth. Additionally, while the caption mentions the camera zooms out, it doesn't state the resulting change in shot size from an extreme close-up to a standard close-up. The final description of the shallow depth of field is accurate, but its impact would be better conveyed by explaining how it isolates the moving ants in the midground from the now-blurry foreground and the cracked surface in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a high-angle shot, a central cluster of ants and sugar crystals occupies the midground of the frame. Individual ants actively crawl over the sugar pile, carrying crystals away and moving from the periphery toward the central cluster, creating dynamic spatial movement. The scene is set on a flat, cracked, blue-grey surface. Initially, the shot is an extreme close-up, but the camera zooms out to a standard close-up, enhancing the sense of depth. The shallow depth of field isolates the moving ants in the midground, while the foreground and the cracked surface in the background become blurry. The camera's focus shifts dynamically, starting slightly blurry, coming into sharp focus, blurring completely, and then refocusing clearly on the central group of ants and sugar.",
