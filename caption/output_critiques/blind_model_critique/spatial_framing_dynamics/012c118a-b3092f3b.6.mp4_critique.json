    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a nighttime urban street scene, capturing the full breadth of the road and its surroundings. The camera remains stationary relative to the vehicle, providing a consistent view throughout. In the initial state, the road stretches into the distance, with parked cars lining both sides. These cars occupy the left and right edges of the frame, positioned in the foreground and middle ground. Buildings with exterior lights are visible along the street, situated in the middle ground and background, flanking the road on either side. Streetlights illuminate the scene, casting light across the road and sidewalks. As the video progresses, the vehicle advances along the road, bringing the initially distant traffic closer. A single car passes in the distance, moving from the left side of the frame towards the center. This car transitions from the background to the middle ground as it approaches. The camera maintains a height level with the vehicle's dashboard, offering a driver's perspective. The overall spatial composition remains largely unchanged, with the primary dynamic being the forward motion of the vehicle and the gradual approach of the passing car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of a nighttime urban street, rather than a specific object. The shot captures the ambient lighting, street layout, and movement of vehicles, offering an immersive experience likely intended to convey the feel of driving through the city at night.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a dashcam mounted on a vehicle, shows a nighttime urban street scene. The road is lined with parked cars on both sides, and lights outside the buildings illuminate the street. Streetlights cast a dim glow, reflecting off the wet pavement, suggesting recent rain. A very noticeable taxi with bright red taillights is parked towards the middle-right side of the road. The vehicle moves smoothly along the road, and at a distant intersection, only one car can be seen moving from right to left. The overall atmosphere is calm, with the focus on the road ahead and the surrounding cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the instruction.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its use of descriptive terminology. It correctly identifies the shot size (\"wide shot\") and uses appropriate spatial terms (\"left and right edges,\" \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") to place elements within the 2D frame and the 3D scene. The description of movement, such as the car transitioning \"from the background to the middle ground,\" is a precise and accurate way to describe changes in depth.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It covers all the key aspects requested:\n*   **Shot Size:** Clearly stated as a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It successfully describes the position of multiple elements (parked cars, buildings, passing car).\n*   **Camera Height:** It specifies the camera is \"level with the vehicle's dashboard.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It effectively describes both the constant forward motion of the main vehicle and the specific movement of the passing car across the frame and through different depth planes.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres strictly to all instructions.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional, subjective, or speculative words.\n*   **Focus:** It remains focused entirely on spatial framing and dynamics, successfully avoiding any narrative or interpretive details.\n*   **Structure:** It logically progresses from the general shot size to the specific positions of static elements, and then to the dynamic movements within the scene, just as the instructions imply.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It is concise, informative, and demonstrates a clear understanding of how to describe a scene's spatial composition and dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a wide shot of a nighttime urban street scene, showcasing the full expanse of the road and its surroundings.
