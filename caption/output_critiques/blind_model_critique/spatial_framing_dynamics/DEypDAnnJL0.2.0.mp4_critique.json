    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a high-angle medium shot of a woman kneeling in the bottom left of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. A white door with a silver doorknob occupies the right side of the frame, while a white air vent is visible behind her in the center-left, both in the middle ground. The woman reaches for the doorknob and then stands up. The shot transitions to a medium close-up at the subject's level, framing her from behind in the center of the frame as she stands close to the door on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with light brown skin and long, curly hair that is a mix of brown and blonde. She is wearing a light-colored knit sweater. At different points, she is seen sitting on the floor and looking upward, as well as standing close to a door and facing it. Her facial expression appears worried, and she is oriented toward the door throughout the video.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a narrow indoor hallway with beige walls and light wood flooring, typical of a residential environment. A white door with a silver-colored doorknob and deadbolt is positioned on the right. Next to the door, near the floor, is a white rectangular air vent with vertical slats. A person with long, curly hair, wearing a white sweater, is lying on the floor, looking up at the doorknob. She then stands up and places her ear against the door. The lighting is even, and the overall color palette is muted.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. The initial description of the woman \"lying at the bottom of the frame\" would be clearer if it included her orientation, such as lying horizontally with her head towards the left, which would better define her relationship to the vertical door on the right. The phrase \"the shot transitions\" is ambiguous; it should specify that this is a hard cut, as the instantaneous change from a high-angle medium shot to an eye-level medium close-up is a significant spatial shift. In the final shot, describing the woman as being in the \"center of the frame\" while also \"close to the door on the right\" is slightly contradictory. A more accurate description might be that she occupies the left-center of the frame, leaving negative space on her left and balanced by the door on the right. Furthermore, the caption omits any mention of depth of field; for instance, in the initial shot, the doorknob in the foreground could be slightly out of focus, drawing the viewer's eye to the woman in the middle ground. Finally, the description of her movement could be more integrated with the camera work, noting that she completes the action of standing up entirely before the cut to the new shot occurs.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a high-angle medium shot of a woman kneeling horizontally in the bottom left of the frame, with her head towards the left. She is positioned in the middle ground, while a white door with a silver doorknob occupies the right side of the frame. A white air vent is visible behind her in the center-left, also in the middle ground. The doorknob in the foreground is slightly out of focus, drawing attention to the woman. She reaches for the doorknob and stands up completely before a hard cut transitions to an eye-level medium close-up. In this new shot, she is framed from behind, occupying the left-center of the frame, with negative space on her left and the door balancing the composition on the right.",
