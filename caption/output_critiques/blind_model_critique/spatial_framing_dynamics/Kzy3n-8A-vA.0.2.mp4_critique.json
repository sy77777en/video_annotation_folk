    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A neon sign for \"Flo's V8 Cafe\" is depicted against a solid purple background. The sign consists of a dark green, oval-shaped base where the words \"Flo's\" and \"Cafe\" are written in pink, cursive neon letters, each outlined with a bright turquoise glow. Rising from the center of the oval is a large \"V8\" symbol. The \"V\" is formed by two angled lines of turquoise neon outlined in pink, and the number \"8\" positioned above it is rendered in turquoise neon with a pink outline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up shot focuses on a retro-style neon sign against a solid dark purple sky. The sign features the words \"Flo's Cafe\" in pink and turquoise cursive neon, set against a green oval background. A large, dark V-shaped structure rises from the middle of the sign. The view tilts upward along this structure to reveal a \"V8\" logo at the top, also illuminated in pink and turquoise neon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as the \"Flo's Cafe\" neon sign, the shot size as medium, and the camera's perspective as a low-angle shot. The description of the camera movement—a vertical tilt upward that follows the sign's structure to the \"V8\" logo—is precise and matches the video's action exactly.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully incorporates all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** \"medium\" is stated at the beginning.\n    *   **Position:** It specifies the sign is in the \"center\" (2D) and \"foreground\" (3D), with a \"solid purple background.\" It also notes the final position of the \"V8\" logo in the \"center of the frame.\"\n    *   **Height:** \"low-angle\" is correctly identified.\n    *   **Changes:** The camera's \"tilts vertically upward\" movement and the resulting change in framing are clearly described from the initial to the final state.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption strictly adheres to all guidelines. It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective adjectives, speculation, and ambiguity. It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics of the visible elements, providing a clear and objective description of the shot.",
