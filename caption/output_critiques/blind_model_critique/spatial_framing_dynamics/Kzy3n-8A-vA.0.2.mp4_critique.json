    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A neon sign for \"Flo's V8 Cafe\" is depicted against a solid purple background. The sign consists of a dark green, oval-shaped base where the words \"Flo's\" and \"Cafe\" are written in pink, cursive neon letters, each outlined with a bright turquoise glow. Rising from the center of the oval is a large \"V8\" symbol. The \"V\" is formed by two angled lines of turquoise neon outlined in pink, and the number \"8\" positioned above it is rendered in turquoise neon with a pink outline.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A close-up shot focuses on a retro-style neon sign against a solid dark purple sky. The sign features the words \"Flo's Cafe\" in pink and turquoise cursive neon, set against a green oval background. A large, dark V-shaped structure rises from the middle of the sign. The view tilts upward along this structure to reveal a \"V8\" logo at the top, also illuminated in pink and turquoise neon.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subject and the upward tilt, but it lacks precision regarding the spatial composition and camera dynamics. The term \"medium shot\" is vague for an inanimate object; the video actually begins with a medium close-up where the \"Flo's Cafe\" text is framed in the lower third of the screen, not the center. The \"solid purple background\" is also an oversimplification, as the video shows a dark, out-of-focus building facade, with the neon sign's glow casting a purple hue onto it. The description omits the camera's initial low-angle position, which makes the sign appear imposing. Most importantly, the camera movement is not just a tilt; it's a combined tilt and slow push-in, which gradually tightens the frame. This transforms the shot from a medium close-up of the lower sign into a tight close-up on the \"V8\" logo, making the final composition more focused and impactful than the caption suggests.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the \"Flo's Cafe\" neon sign, positioned in the lower third of the screen. The camera starts from a low-angle perspective, making the sign appear imposing against a dark, out-of-focus building facade, which is subtly illuminated by the neon glow, casting a purple hue. The camera then executes a combined tilt and slow push-in movement, gradually tightening the frame. This dynamic motion transitions the shot from the initial medium close-up of the sign to a tight close-up on the \"V8\" logo at the top, now centered in the frame, enhancing the focus and impact of the final composition.",
