    "pre_caption": "A wide shot captures a night street scene from a vehicle's perspective. Initially, a white sedan is stationary in the center of the frame, located in the middle ground. To its left is a dark SUV, and to its right are other vehicles, all in the middle ground. In the background, red traffic lights are visible in the upper center. As the camera vehicle moves forward, the white sedan in the center grows larger in the frame, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground, while the vehicles on the left and right also advance. The traffic lights in the background transition from red to green. Throughout the shot, reflections of taillights are visible on the dashboard at the bottom of the frame, in the foreground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video, shot from a dashcam at night, focuses on a white Toyota sedan stopped at an intersection. The sedan's red taillights and a high-mounted third brake light are brightly illuminated, and its license plate is visible. To the left of the white sedan is a dark-colored SUV with a spare tire mounted on its rear door. On the right side, there are three vehicles: a dark sedan, a white SUV, and a dark SUV. The traffic lights ahead are initially red, then switch to green. In the background, one person is visible crossing the street. Reflections of the traffic lights and the sedan's red taillights and brake light are present in the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-facing dashcam view from a vehicle-mounted camera captures a scene on a city street at night. The vehicle is stopped behind a white sedan at an intersection on Bedford Avenue, with other cars visible on either side. The street is flanked by dark buildings and illuminated by streetlights and the red glow of traffic signals and vehicle taillights. The traffic lights then switch from red to green.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the camera's movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and sequence of events. The term \"wide shot\" might be inaccurate; if the white sedan fills a significant portion of the frame, \"medium shot\" would be more appropriate, with the \"wide shot\" descriptor reserved for a scene showing more of the surrounding buildings and environment, which are not mentioned. The initial action is slightly confusing; it's more likely the video begins with all vehicles already stationary at the red light, rather than capturing the white sedan braking. The description of the forward motion is incomplete; it should clarify that after the light turns green, the white sedan also begins to move forward, concurrent with the camera vehicle, which is why it grows larger in the frame. The placement of the traffic lights in the \"middle ground\" is questionable; given their typical placement, they are almost certainly in the background, further away than the vehicles. Finally, the description could be enriched by including other plausible elements, such as glowing streetlights or illuminated building windows in the background, and visible lane markings on the road in the foreground, which would better establish the scene's depth and the vehicle's path.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot captures a night street scene from a vehicle's perspective. Initially, all vehicles, including a prominent white sedan in the center of the frame, are stationary at a red light. To the left of the sedan is a dark SUV, and to its right are other vehicles, all positioned in the middle ground. In the background, red traffic lights are visible above the vehicles. As the light turns green, the white sedan begins to move forward, growing larger in the frame as it advances toward the foreground, along with the camera vehicle. The vehicles on the left and right also move forward. Reflections of taillights are visible on the dashboard at the bottom of the frame, enhancing the sense of motion. The scene is enriched by glowing streetlights and illuminated building windows in the background, while visible lane markings on the road in the foreground establish the vehicle's path. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing the dynamic transition from stationary to motion.",
