    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide scenery shot of a desert landscape. The composition is dominated by large sand dunes that occupy the middle ground and background, stretching across the frame. The sun is positioned in the top left, with a pale blue sky filling the upper portion of the frame. A flat expanse of sand extends across the foreground at the bottom. A single palm tree stands in the right foreground, with another smaller one visible on a dune slope in the left middle ground. A few more distant palm trees are scattered in the valley between the dunes in the center-middle ground. The camera is positioned at a low height, and the shot remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast desert under a bright, hazy sun. The scene is dominated by massive, rolling sand dunes that create a series of smooth, undulating lines across the horizon against a pale blue sky. The shot lacks a main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and stark, windswept atmosphere of the desert environment. A few distant palm trees are visible, but they serve only to emphasize the vastness of the landscape rather than acting as a focal point.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A vast desert landscape is characterized by large, rolling sand dunes under a hazy, pale blue sky. The sun shines brightly in the upper left, its light diffused by the atmosphere. The dunes are a light tan color, with smooth, sweeping curves and deep shadows defining their shapes. Wind blows sand across the surface, creating a dusty haze throughout the scene. A few sparse palm trees are scattered in the distance and in the middleground, standing against the immense scale of the dunes.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the extreme wide shot and the general placement of elements, but it lacks specificity regarding key visual details that define the scene's composition and depth. For instance, with the sun positioned in the top left, there would be prominent shadows cast by the dunes and the palm trees; the caption omits these shadows, which would be crucial for defining the dunes' shapes and creating depth across the landscape. The description of the dunes as \"large\" is vague; it could be improved by describing their form, such as sharp-crested ridgelines that curve from the center towards the top right, guiding the viewer's eye. Furthermore, the \"flat expanse of sand\" in the foreground would likely have visible textures like wind-blown ripples, a detail that is currently missing. The framing of the single palm tree in the right foreground is also ambiguous; clarifying whether it is fully contained within the frame or partially cut off would provide a more precise spatial understanding.",

The sun, positioned in the top left, casts prominent shadows that define the dunes' shapes and create depth across the landscape. The pale blue sky fills the upper portion of the frame, while the foreground features a flat expanse of sand with visible wind-blown ripples.
