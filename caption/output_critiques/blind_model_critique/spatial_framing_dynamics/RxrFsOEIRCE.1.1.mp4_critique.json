    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins with an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, with no single main subject. A vast green field occupies the foreground and middle ground, extending from the bottom of the frame. In the background, a village is positioned on a hill in the top left, while a dense forest is located in the middle ground on the right. The camera moves forward at a very low altitude, creating significant motion blur on the fields in the foreground and the scattered trees in the left middle ground. As the camera advances, the shot transitions to a wide shot as it enters a narrow passage. In this final framing, the view is flanked by the forest on the right and other trees on the left, both now in the foreground and middle ground, with the path ahead centered in the frame. The camera remains at a low height relative to the ground throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a fast-paced, low-altitude flight over a vibrant, sunlit rural countryside. The view begins above rolling green fields and transitions into a narrow passage flanked by trees on both sides, bordered on one side by a dense forest and on the other by scattered trees leading up to a small village nestled on a distant hill under a bright blue sky. The rapid forward motion creates a significant blur, particularly at the edges of the view, which emphasizes the exhilarating speed of the journey. This focus on the immersive experience of movement through the environment means there is no single main subject; instead, the atmosphere of a swift flight across the expansive, verdant landscape takes precedence.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video begins with a drone flying over a vast green field, capturing the landscape with impressive speed on a bright, sunny day. The rapid forward movement creates a significant motion blur on the grass and scattered trees to the left. As the scene transitions, the drone navigates through a narrow forest passage, offering a close-up view of the tree branches and leaves. The sunlight filtering through the foliage adds a beautiful, natural illumination to the scene. In the background, a small village with houses sits on a gentle hill, and to the right, a dense line of leafy green trees borders the field. The sky is blue with a few scattered white clouds and a bright sun causing some lens flare.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the initial shot as an \"extreme wide shot\" of a rural landscape and its transition to a \"wide shot.\" The description of the elements—green field, village on a hill, and forest—along with their spatial positions (e.g., village in the top left background, forest in the right middle ground) is precise. The description of the camera's forward movement at a low altitude and the resulting motion blur is also a correct observation of the video's dynamics.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully addresses every component requested in the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It specifies both the initial (\"extreme wide shot\") and final (\"wide shot\") sizes.\n*   **Position:** It provides both the 2D (left, right, bottom, center) and 3D (foreground, middle ground, background) positions for all major elements in both the initial and final framing.\n*   **Depth:** The use of foreground, middle ground, and background effectively establishes the scene's depth.\n*   **Height:** It correctly notes that the camera remains at a \"low height\" throughout.\n*   **Changes:** It clearly describes the forward camera movement and how this motion transforms the spatial framing, bringing background/middle ground elements into the foreground.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Content and Structure:** It begins with the shot size and logically progresses through the spatial arrangement, movement, and final composition.\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"serene\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems,\" \"might be\"), sticking strictly to observable spatial facts.\n*   **Focus:** The entire description is focused on spatial framing and dynamics, as required.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, providing a description that is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly aligned with all stylistic and structural requirements. It effectively translates the visual and spatial information of the video into a clear and concise text.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with an extreme wide shot of a rural landscape, featuring a vast green field in the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a village is situated on a hill in the top left, while a dense forest occupies the middle ground on the right. The camera moves forward at a low altitude, creating motion blur on the fields and scattered trees in the left middle ground. As the camera advances, the shot transitions to a wide shot, entering a narrow passage. In this final view, the forest is on the right and other trees are on the left, both in the foreground and middle ground, with the path ahead centered in the frame.
