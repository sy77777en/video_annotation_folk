    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static close-up view. The Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" is the primary element, initially appearing as dark, recessed characters on a textured rock surface that fills the entire background. The letters are arranged diagonally across the frame: \"II\" is positioned in the bottom-left foreground, \"Α\" slightly to its right and above towards the center-left foreground, \"Χ\" in the central foreground, \"Ω\" to its right and above towards the center-right foreground, and \"Ν\" in the top-right foreground. Over a few seconds, these letters transition from dark indentations, perceived as part of the middle ground rock surface, to glowing bright white elements that appear superimposed in the foreground. The rocky background, with its green, brown, and grey hues, remains static throughout. The camera maintains a consistent, direct perspective, possibly slightly elevated, focusing on the word and the immediate rock texture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays the Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" superimposed on a textured, rocky surface. The letters, initially appearing as dark, shadowy indentations on the stone, gradually illuminate to a bright, glowing white. The background surface exhibits a layered, uneven texture with varying shades of green, brown, and grey, suggesting a natural rock formation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows a close-up of a rough, textured rock surface, predominantly in shades of green and gray, with visible layers and crevices. An overlay of the Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" appears on the rock. Initially, the letters are dark and seem carved into the surface. Then, the letters illuminate, glowing bright white against the darker background.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good but has a few minor flaws that prevent it from being perfect. It excels in detail and structure but violates the rule against speculative language.\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Highly Accurate:** The description of the subject (\"IIΑΧΩΝ\"), its diagonal arrangement, and the specific 2D positions of each letter (bottom-left, center, top-right) is precise and correct.\n*   **Minor Inconsistency:** There is a slight contradiction in the description of depth. The caption first places all letters in the \"foreground\" but later states they transition from \"dark indentations, perceived as part of the middle ground rock surface.\" Recessed or indented letters would technically be in the middle ground relative to the rock's immediate surface (foreground). While the transition description clarifies this, the initial statement is slightly inaccurate.\n\n### Completeness:\n*   **Excellent:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions.\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"close-up.\"\n*   **Position (2D and 3D):** Provides a thorough breakdown of both the 2D position within the frame and the 3D depth for the main subject.\n*   **Changes:** Clearly describes the primary dynamic of the video—the letters transitioning from dark indentations to glowing white elements, including the change in their perceived depth from middle ground to foreground.\n*   **Camera:** Mentions the static camera and its perspective.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Strengths:** The caption follows most rules well. It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple English, and focuses almost entirely on spatial framing and dynamics as requested. It correctly avoids emotional adjectives.\n*   **Weaknesses (Violation of Rules):** The main issue is the use of speculative or ambiguous language, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'\").\n    *   \"...**perceived as** part of the middle ground...\": \"Perceived as\" is a form of subjective interpretation. A more direct description would be \"as dark indentations within the middle ground rock surface.\"\n    *   \"...that **appear superimposed** in the foreground.\": The word \"appear\" is a direct violation of the instruction to avoid \"it appears.\" A better phrasing would be \"...to become glowing bright white elements in the foreground.\"\n    *   \"...**possibly** slightly elevated...\": The word \"possibly\" is speculative and forbidden. If the camera's height is uncertain, it should be omitted. If it is certain, it should be stated directly (e.g., \"The camera is positioned slightly above the subject\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is exceptionally detailed and well-structured but needs revision to eliminate speculative words like \"perceived,\" \"appear,\" and \"possibly\" to fully comply with the instructions.",
