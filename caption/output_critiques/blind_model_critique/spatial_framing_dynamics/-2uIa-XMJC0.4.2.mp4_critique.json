    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a woman standing on a skateboard on the ledge of a tall building. Initially, the camera is positioned at her level, capturing her from the side as she stands centered in the frame, with the building's windows forming the backdrop. The windows reflect the cityscape, situating the scene in the foreground while the urban landscape occupies the background. As the video progresses, the camera shifts to a lower angle, now positioned below the subject. This change in perspective emphasizes her elevated position on the ledge. Throughout the video, the woman remains in the center of the frame, maintaining a steady stance on the skateboard. The camera movement from her level to below her enhances the sense of height and scale, underscoring her position against the expansive cityscape reflected in the windows behind her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman standing on a skateboard, positioned on the ledge of a tall building. She is wearing a white tank top, light-colored pants, and a knitted cap, highlighting her focus on safety and style. Notably, she has a prosthetic right leg. She is balanced on the skateboard, which is oriented parallel to the building's windows. The setting is urban, with a cityscape visible in the reflection of the windows, indicating a high altitude. The woman maintains a steady stance, facing forward, with a confident posture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a futuristic urban landscape during daylight. The setting is outdoors, featuring a cityscape with modern skyscrapers and reflective glass facades. The entire cityscape is beautifully mirrored in the glass facades. The architecture is sleek and contemporary, with tall buildings dominating the skyline. The weather is partly cloudy. **\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level. It then changes to below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption's use of \"wide shot\" is inaccurate. A wide shot would typically show the subject in relation to a much larger environment. Given that the camera captures the woman from the side and she is centered, \"medium shot\" or \"medium-long shot\" would be more precise, as the framing focuses on her rather than the entire building or a vast cityscape.\n*   **Spatial Elements:** The description of the background is incorrect and confusing. It states, \"the urban landscape occupies the background,\" which is not visible. The windows are in the middle ground, and they show a *reflection* of the cityscape. There is no actual background visible behind the windows. The caption conflates a reflection with a true background element.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption successfully identifies the main subject (the woman), her 2D position (center), and the key camera movement (shifting from her level to a lower angle).\n*   It correctly describes the change in the camera's height relative to the subject.\n*   It notes the static nature of the subject (\"remains in the center...maintaining a steady stance\").\n*   However, it could be more direct in defining the 3D depth. For instance, stating \"The woman and the ledge are in the foreground, and the windows behind her are in the middle ground\" would be clearer than the current phrasing.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses interpretive and subjective language. Phrases like \"emphasizes her elevated position,\" \"enhances the sense of height and scale,\" and \"underscoring her position\" describe the *effect* of the framing on the viewer, which the instructions explicitly forbid. The goal is to describe the spatial dynamics, not their emotional or perceptual impact.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The final sentence is largely redundant and interpretive, repeating information about the camera movement and its effect. The description of the background and reflection is unclear and violates the rule to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n*   **Structure:** The caption correctly follows the single-paragraph format and attempts to cover the required elements (shot size, position, height, movement).\n\nIn summary, the caption is not good. While it correctly identifies the subject and the primary camera movement, it fails on key points of accuracy (shot size, background description) and violates core instructions by including subjective, interpretive language and being unclear about the spatial depth.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a medium shot of a woman standing on a skateboard on the ledge of a tall building. The camera initially captures her from the side, centered in the frame, with the building's windows behind her. These windows reflect the cityscape, creating a middle ground, while the woman and the ledge are in the foreground. As the video progresses, the camera shifts to a lower angle, positioned below the subject, highlighting her elevated stance on the ledge. Throughout the video, the woman remains steady in the center of the frame, maintaining her position on the skateboard. The camera movement from her level to below her accentuates her height against the reflected cityscape in the windows.",
