    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot captured from a high angle, a man on a bicycle is positioned on a train that moves from left to right across the lower half of the frame. Initially, the man is on a ramp in the center-left, with a cornfield in the middle ground to the left and a combine harvester in the middle ground to the right. A railroad crossing sign occupies the foreground at the center-left. The camera pans right, following the man as he rides up the ramp and performs a flip, landing on a large container that becomes the central element. He then rides from left to right across the top of this container. As he reaches a set of stairs at the container's right end, he performs another flip, moving from the top-center to the lower-right to land on a subsequent flatbed car. The camera continues to pan right and lowers to the subject's level, keeping the man centered as he rides away on the final car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man wearing a blue helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants performs stunts on a black mountain bike atop a moving freight train. He ascends a blue ramp featuring a Red Bull logo, executes a front flip in mid-air, and lands on a large blue shipping container marked with a wide red stripe bearing the word \"PRADA\" in white capital letters. The man then performs a backflip over a staircase at the end of the container, which appears to be light wood in color, before landing on another flatbed car.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a rural landscape at dusk, a long freight train travels along tracks that bisect a vast expanse of farmland. On the left side of the tracks, a mature cornfield stands tall, while on the right lies a tilled, empty field where a green combine harvester is parked. In the distance, the silhouette of a small town with a church steeple is visible against the pale sky. The train itself is composed of flatbed cars, some of which have been modified with unique structures: a blue and red ramp bearing a \"Red Bull\" logo, a large blue shipping container with a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in white, and a light wood staircase. A railroad crossing sign, complete with a red octagonal \"STOP\" sign, stands in the foreground next to the moving train.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and successfully fulfills all the requirements of the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and demonstrates a strong understanding of how to describe spatial dynamics in a video.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately uses technical and descriptive terms. \"Wide shot,\" \"high angle,\" \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"pans right,\" and \"lowers to the subject's level\" are all used correctly to describe the camera work and scene composition.\n*   The description of movement is precise. It correctly identifies the train's direction (\"moves from left to right\"), the camera's tracking movement (\"pans right, following the man\"), and the subject's specific path during the stunts (\"moving from the top-center to the lower-right\").\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **All required elements are included:** The caption addresses shot size, 2D position (center-left, lower-right), 3D depth (foreground, middle ground), and the camera's relative height (high angle, subject's level).\n*   **Changes are detailed:** It effectively describes the dynamic nature of the shot, noting the initial state and clearly explaining the transitions, such as the camera panning and lowering, and the subject moving between different parts of the train.\n*   **All key subjects/elements are covered:** It mentions the main subject (man on a bicycle) and contextual elements (train, cornfield, combine harvester, railroad sign, container), providing their spatial relationship to each other and to the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Spatial Framing:** The entire paragraph is dedicated to describing the spatial and dynamic aspects of the scene, avoiding narrative or emotional interpretation.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. It forms a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to follow despite the amount of detail it contains.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective adjectives (\"amazing,\" \"daring\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"he might be\"), sticking strictly to observable facts as instructed.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
