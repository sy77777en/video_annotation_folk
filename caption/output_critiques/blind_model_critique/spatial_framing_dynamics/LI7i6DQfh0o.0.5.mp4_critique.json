    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot focuses on a person's hands holding a white ramekin in the top-center of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. Directly below, a white bowl containing berries sits in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, nestled within a square orange container. The kitchen environment is visible in the out-of-focus background. As the person sprinkles the contents from the ramekin onto the berries, the word \"FREE\" appears in large, white text in the center of the frame, superimposed over the bowl and hands. The camera remains stationary and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with light skin, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt over a light-colored top, holds a small, white, ribbed ramekin. With their fingers, they sprinkle the contents of the ramekin, which appear to be seeds or grains, onto a white, shallow bowl filled with red raspberries and dark blueberries. The bowl of fruit is placed inside a bright orange, square-shaped container with rounded corners and a white inner rim. As the person sprinkles the topping, the word \"FREE\" appears in large, white, sans-serif letters in the center of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor kitchen setting, a person in a white shirt stands at a light-colored countertop preparing a meal. They hold a small, white, ribbed ramekin and sprinkle its contents onto a white plate filled with raspberries and blueberries. The plate rests inside a square, orange container. In the background, the kitchen environment is softly out of focus. An overlay with the word \"FREE\" in a large, white, sans-serif font appears in the center of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and almost perfectly adheres to all instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured, providing a clear and concise description of the video's spatial framing and dynamics.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption correctly identifies the shot size as a \"close-up.\"\n*   It accurately lists all the main subjects and elements: the hands, white ramekin, white bowl with berries, and the orange container.\n*   The 2D and 3D positions are described precisely (e.g., \"top-center\" and \"center\" for 2D, \"middle ground\" and \"background\" for 3D).\n*   The description of the action (\"sprinkles the contents\") and the appearance of the text overlay (\"word 'FREE' appears... superimposed over the bowl and hands\") is spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully incorporates all the required descriptive elements: shot size, 2D/3D position, depth (by mentioning the \"out-of-focus background\"), camera height, and spatial changes.\n*   It effectively describes the static nature of the camera and the dynamic elements within the frame (the sprinkling and the text overlay).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is written in simple, natural English and forms a single, coherent paragraph. It avoids jargon and emotional language.\n*   **Objectivity:** It correctly avoids speculative or subjective statements.\n*   **Structure:** The caption follows the logical flow requested by the instructions: it begins with the shot size, moves to the spatial arrangement of elements, describes the changes, and concludes with the camera's properties.\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption correctly includes the provided information that the camera is \"positioned at the subject's level,\" demonstrating perfect adherence to the prompt's constraints.",
