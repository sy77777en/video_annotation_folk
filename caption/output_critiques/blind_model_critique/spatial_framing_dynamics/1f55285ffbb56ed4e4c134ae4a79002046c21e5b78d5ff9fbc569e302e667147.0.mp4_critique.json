    "pre_caption": "The video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal scene, capturing the expansive interaction between the ocean and the sandy shore. The turquoise waves occupy the upper portion of the frame, extending from the top left to the top right, while the dark, wet sand covers the lower section, spanning from the bottom left to the bottom right. The white foam of the waves forms a dynamic line across the middle of the frame, separating the ocean from the beach. This line shifts slightly as the waves move, maintaining a consistent presence in the middle ground. The camera remains stationary, positioned above the scene, providing a bird's-eye view that emphasizes the contrast between the deep green-blue ocean and the rich brown sand. The spatial composition remains stable throughout the video, with no noticeable changes in shot size or camera angle. The camera's height is consistently above the scene, offering a comprehensive perspective of the coastal dynamics.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures the rhythmic motion of waves gently crashing onto a sandy shore. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the contrast between the deep green-blue of the ocean and the dark, wet sand. The white foam of the waves creates a dynamic line that emphasizes the movement and energy of the sea. The absence of a specific subject allows the viewer to appreciate the vastness and tranquility of the coastal scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases an outdoor coastal scene during daylight. The setting features a shoreline where turquoise waves crash onto a sandy beach. The water is a mix of deep green and blue hues, with white foam forming at the wave crests. The sand is a rich brown, creating a stark contrast with the vibrant ocean. The texture of the sand is smooth, with subtle markings from the receding water. The overall scene is serene, with the rhythmic motion of the waves providing a dynamic element against the static beach.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly aligns with the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a common top-down or high-angle shot of a shoreline. It correctly identifies the key visual elements (ocean, sand, foam) and their spatial relationship. The description of the foam as a \"dynamic line\" that \"shifts slightly\" is a precise and effective way to capture the movement within the static frame.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive and covers all the required points from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the \"extreme wide shot\" of the scenery.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D/3D):** It clearly defines the 2D positions (upper, lower, middle, left to right) and 3D depth (\"middle ground\" for the foam, with the ocean and sand implicitly being background and foreground, respectively).\n    *   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states the camera is \"positioned above the scene\" and provides a \"bird's-eye view.\"\n    *   **Dynamics:** It notes that the camera is stationary while describing the subtle movement of the waves and foam, fulfilling the requirement to describe spatial dynamics.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the guidelines precisely:\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the overall shot to the specific elements and their movements.\n    *   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and descriptive English (\"turquoise waves,\" \"dark, wet sand\"). It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives and speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n    *   **Focus:** It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics as requested, without adding any irrelevant information.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is presented as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.",
