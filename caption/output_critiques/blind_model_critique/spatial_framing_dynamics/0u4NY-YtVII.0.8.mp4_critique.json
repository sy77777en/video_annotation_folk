    "pre_caption": "The scene presents an overhead view of a map centered on Türkiye, which serves as the background. The text \"Türkiye\" is positioned in the center-right area of the map (middle ground). In the top-left quadrant, the city of Bursa is highlighted, accompanied by the label \"Bursa\" and a pointer directed towards the highlighted area, all situated in the middle ground. Attribution text is located in the bottom-left corner as a foreground overlay. The camera slowly zooms out during the shot, making the map and its labels appear progressively smaller within the frame, revealing more of the black background surrounding the map. The relative positions of the elements remain constant. The perspective is consistently from directly above.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a dark gray and black map focused on the country of Türkiye. The outline of Türkiye is prominently featured, with the name \"Türkiye\" written in white text across the central part of the country. In the northwestern region of Türkiye, the city of Bursa is highlighted with a white outline, labeled \"Bursa\" in white text, and indicated by a white arrow pointing to its location.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video displays a monochromatic map centered on Türkiye. The country's landmass is depicted in dark gray with lighter gray outlines, set against a black background showing surrounding regions and bodies of water. Overlaid onto the map is a white pointer directed at a location in northwestern Türkiye, accompanied by the white text label \"Bursa\". The name \"Türkiye\" is overlaid in larger white text across the central part of the country map. At the bottom left corner, an overlay provides attribution text: \"[H] - © OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO\". The scene remains static throughout the video, and the camera slowly zooms out.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main elements, their positions, and the overall camera zoom, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and visual details. The distinction between the map as \"background\" and its labels as \"middle ground\" is confusing; it would be more accurate to describe the map and all its integrated labels and highlights as existing on the same middle-ground plane, with the black void as the background. The description misses the initial animation: it fails to mention how the highlight for Bursa appears—for instance, it might pulse or expand into view rather than just being static. Similarly, the pointer and \"Bursa\" label could animate onto the screen. The caption also neglects to define the shot size transition, which likely moves from a medium shot, where the map fills the frame, to a wide shot as the camera zooms out. Finally, the description of the zoom is basic; a more detailed account would specify if the zoom begins immediately or after the initial elements have animated into place and settled for a moment.",
