    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle shot framing the upper portion of a light-colored figurine lying face-down, positioned slightly towards the top right of the frame on the floor (background plane). A large wooden structure dominates the bottom left foreground/middle ground, while another wooden structure partially obscures the figurine in the middle ground. Additional wooden structures are visible in the top left and top right middle ground/background. Numerous small, colorful objects are scattered across the floor, particularly concentrated around the figurine. As the camera moves slightly, tilting or pulling back, the view expands to a full shot, revealing the entire horizontal figurine occupying the center-right area. The spatial relationship between the figurine, the structures, and the scattered objects remains consistent, viewed from the same high-angle, overhead perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a figurine lying face-down on the ground, partially obscured by wooden structures. The figurine is light-colored and initially visible from the knee up, with an arm extended outward. As the camera moves, the entire figure is revealed, showing it in a horizontal position. The wooden structures, which appear to be shelf-like, cover parts of the figurine, creating a layered effect. Scattered around the scene are small, colorful objects, adding texture to the setting. The focus remains on the figurine and its interaction with the surrounding elements.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a tiled floor, where a large, abstract sculpture resembling a human figure lies horizontally. Surrounding the figure are several wooden structures, possibly resembling shelves or crates, some of which are overturned or leaning. Scattered across the floor are small, colorful objects, adding a sense of disarray. The scene is well-lit, suggesting an artificial light source typical of an indoor environment. Added text is present in the lower left corner, indicating additional information not part of the physical scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot seems to focus on one main subject, a figurine lying on the ground, partially covered by wooden structures. Initially, the figure is visible from the knee up, but as the camera moves upward, a full shot of the figure is revealed.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions:\n\nThe caption is good but contains one significant flaw that violates a key instruction.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the scene. It correctly identifies the main subject (a figurine), its orientation (lying face-down), the camera angle (high-angle/overhead), the presence of other elements (wooden structures, small colorful objects), and the camera movement (a slight pullback or tilt that expands the view). The description of the subject's initial partial framing and subsequent full-shot reveal is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required components:\n*   **Shot Size:** It clearly describes the initial shot (\"framing the upper portion\") and the final shot (\"a full shot\").\n*   **Position (2D & 3D):** It effectively maps out the scene, placing the figurine (top right, center-right; background), wooden structures (bottom left, top left, top right; foreground, middle ground), and scattered objects.\n*   **Depth:** The use of foreground, middle ground, and background, along with the detail that one structure \"partially obscures the figurine,\" creates a clear sense of depth.\n*   **Camera Height:** It correctly identifies the \"high-angle, overhead perspective\" and notes that it remains consistent.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It expertly describes the change in framing resulting from the camera movement (\"the view expands... revealing the entire horizontal figurine\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most instructions well but fails on one critical point.\n*   **Strengths:** It uses simple, objective language, avoids speculation and emotional adjectives, and is formatted as a single, coherent paragraph. It focuses on the essential spatial details as requested.\n*   **Weakness:** The primary issue is the violation of the rule: \"**Avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'**.\" The caption uses this format twice with \"foreground/middle ground\" and \"middle ground/background\". Instead of using a slash, it should have made a definitive choice or described the element as spanning multiple planes (e.g., \"a large wooden structure extends from the foreground into the middle ground\"). This ambiguity is the caption's main flaw. A minor point is the use of \"background plane,\" which is slightly technical; simply \"background\" would align better with the \"simple, natural English\" instruction.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent in its descriptive accuracy and completeness but needs revision to eliminate the ambiguous \"A/B\" positional descriptions to fully comply with the instructions.",
