    "pre_caption": "In a wide, side-view shot, the scene initially frames two large, gray landmasses in the middle ground, separated by a central chasm. A timer is positioned in the top left foreground. A small, red, cube-shaped character appears on the top right platform and jumps into the chasm. The camera pans down, following the character as it descends through the center of the frame between hazardous, red-spiked walls. The character then moves toward the bottom left, landing on a small platform. The camera's movement concludes by framing the character in the bottom left middle ground, with a large cliff face occupying the right side of the frame and a mechanical structure supporting the platform from the bottom left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, red, cube-shaped character is the central subject. The environment is composed of large, gray, blocky platforms and structures with irregular, jagged edges. The edges of many of these platforms and vertical surfaces are lined with a continuous row of small, red, sharp-looking spikes. At the top of the scene, a black, angular, cage-like structure contains a white rectangle displaying red digital numbers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a minimalist, monochromatic world composed of gray, blocky platforms and cliffs suspended against a hazy, light gray background. The environment features a deep chasm separating two large landmasses, with the vertical walls of the chasm and the edges of some platforms lined with red, serrated hazards. On the top of the two landmasses, faint silhouettes of what appear to be cranes or catapults are visible. The scene shows movement from a high platform, down the hazardous chasm, and onto a lower platform supported by a mechanical arm with chains. An overlay in the top left corner displays a timer within a black, angular frame, showing elapsed time with red digital numbers.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main sequence of events, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. The term \"pans down\" is slightly inaccurate for a vertical camera movement; \"tilts down\" or \"tracks downward\" would better describe the camera following the character's descent. The description of the character's appearance as simply \"appears\" is vague; a more specific action, such as \"spawns in with a particle effect,\" would provide clearer information. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the scene's depth; for instance, it fails to mention the static, dark gray industrial background visible behind the main landmasses, which would add another layer to the spatial composition. Furthermore, as the camera follows the character into the narrow chasm, the shot effectively tightens from a wide shot to a medium shot, focusing more closely on the character and the immediate spiked walls, a change in framing that is not noted. Finally, the description of the character's final movement as \"moves toward the left\" is generic; specifying the action, such as \"performs a wall-jump off the right cliff face to propel itself leftward,\" would more accurately capture the dynamics of the scene.",
