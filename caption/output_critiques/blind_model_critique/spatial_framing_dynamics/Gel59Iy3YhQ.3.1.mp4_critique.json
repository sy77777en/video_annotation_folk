    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of an empty office hallway. The video is presented as a wide, first-person POV shot from eye level, looking straight down the long corridor, which establishes a strong one-point perspective. Initially, a large window is on the left wall, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. On the right wall, a white door marked \"448\" is positioned in the middle ground. Further down the hall in the background, another door marked \"449\" is visible on the left, with several papers scattered on the floor in the middle ground. The camera then moves steadily forward down the center of the hallway. As it advances, elements like the door and papers transition from the middle ground into the foreground before passing out of the frame, while the background elements, particularly door 449, move closer to become the central focus in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a scenery shot of an empty office hallway. The focus is on the sterile, liminal environment itself rather than centering on a specific character or object. The long corridor features beige walls, an orange carpet littered with scattered papers, and a ceiling with recessed fluorescent lights. White doors are marked with numbers, such as '448' and '449', and large windows on both sides of the wall offer glimpses into adjacent, dimly lit office spaces.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves down an empty office hallway. The corridor features beige walls, an orange carpet, and a beige ceiling with recessed, rectangular fluorescent lights. On the right, a white door is marked with the number \"448,\" while another door further down at the end of the hallway is labeled \"449.\" Additional doors are present on both sides of the hallway. A large, rectangular window on the left wall looks into an adjacent office where a clock is visible on the wall, and there is also another large, rectangular window on the right wall that looks into another office. Several white papers are scattered on the carpeted floor near the left wall towards the end of the hallway.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the initial one-point perspective and the placement of the doors, but its description of the spatial dynamics is inconsistent and lacks detail. The statement that \"elements like the door and papers transition from the middle ground into the foreground\" is confusing and partially incorrect; door 447 starts in the foreground, while the papers are initially in the background. A more accurate description would detail how door 447 immediately exits the frame, followed by the window and door 448, as the camera advances. Furthermore, the caption misses a key spatial element: the large window on the left would likely cast a bright reflection or a patch of light on the polished floor and the right wall, and this light pattern would dynamically shift and stretch as the camera moves down the hall. The description of the video's conclusion is also vague; it states that door 449 becomes the \"central focus\" but fails to specify the final framing—for instance, whether the camera stops to frame the door in a medium shot or continues past it. Finally, as the papers move from the background to the foreground, their specific arrangement on the floor, such as being clustered near the bottom left of the door, would become clear and should be mentioned to complete the spatial description.",

On the right, door 448 is positioned in the middle ground, while door 447 is in the foreground and quickly exits the frame as the camera advances. Further down the hall, door 449 is visible in the background on the left, with several papers scattered near the bottom left of the door. As the camera moves steadily forward down the center of the hallway, the window and door 448 transition from the middle ground to the foreground before passing out of the frame. The papers, initially in the background, become more clearly arranged as they move into the foreground. The video concludes with door 449 becoming the central focus in the middle ground, framed in a medium shot as the camera stops.",
