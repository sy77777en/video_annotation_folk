    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a cityscape, capturing the expansive urban environment. Initially, the scene is set in darkness, with a large, faceted spherical structure dominating the foreground on the right side. This sphere is positioned centrally in the 2D frame but occupies the foreground in 3D space. Surrounding buildings and trees are faintly visible in the background, creating a subdued and mysterious atmosphere. As the video progresses, the lighting transitions to daylight, revealing more details of the city. The spherical structure gradually moves out of the frame, shifting the focus to the cityscape. The camera maintains an elevated position, looking down upon the urban area. The city fills the frame, with buildings spread across the middle ground and background. Modern and classical architecture is evident, with some structures featuring diverse colors, particularly in the central area. A classical building with an arched roof is located towards the left-middle part of the frame, while other prominent buildings with flat roofs and large windows are scattered throughout. Trees line the streets, adding greenery to the dense urban layout. The camera remains consistently above the city, providing a broad overview of the area. Text reading \"Berlin, Germany\" appears discreetly in the bottom right corner, offering context without interfering with the visual composition",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the city rather than a specific object. The wide view captures the scale and layout of the urban area, highlighting the architecture and spatial arrangement, which emphasizes the collective scene rather than any individual element.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an outdoor urban setting, transitioning from night to day. Initially, the scene is enveloped in darkness, highlighting a large, faceted spherical structure. Surrounding buildings and trees are barely visible, creating a mysterious atmosphere. As the video progresses, daylight reveals a detailed cityscape with modern and classical architecture. While most buildings are predominantly white, a specific area of the city features structures with diverse colors. Prominent buildings have flat roofs and large windows, with a mix of rectangular shapes. Notably, a classical building with an arched roof is visible in the scene. The environment is densely packed with structures, and the streets are lined with trees. The overall color scheme shifts from dark, muted tones to bright, neutral hues. Overlay elements include text and icons, positioned unobtrusively in the corners, with the text in the bottom right corner reading \"Berlin, Germany,\" providing additional information without obstructing the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is a decent attempt but has several significant flaws when measured against the provided instructions. It successfully identifies the shot size and major elements but fails on key constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption contains a direct internal contradiction. It first states the spherical structure is \"on the right side\" of the frame, but the next sentence claims it is \"positioned centrally in the 2D frame.\" This is a major accuracy error that makes the spatial description unreliable.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is fairly complete. It correctly identifies the shot size (wide shot), camera height (elevated), and the 3D positions of key elements (foreground, middle ground, background). It also successfully describes a major spatial change (the sphere moving out of the frame) and the transition from dark to light. It mentions multiple elements like buildings, trees, and on-screen text.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** This is where the caption fails most significantly.\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The phrase \"creating a subdued and mysterious atmosphere\" is a direct violation of this rule. It describes a feeling or mood, not an objective visual fact.\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** While not using forbidden phrases like \"it appears,\" the caption uses interpretive and slightly subjective words. \"Dominating\" is an interpretation of visual weight. \"Discreetly\" and \"without interfering with the visual composition\" describe intent and effect rather than just stating the text's presence and location. The instruction calls for simple, factual description.\n    *   **Clarity and Coherence:** The contradiction regarding the sphere's position (\"right side\" vs. \"centrally\") makes the description incoherent and confusing.\n\nIn summary, while the caption covers the necessary components of spatial framing, it fails to adhere to the strict stylistic and content constraints, particularly by including subjective language and presenting contradictory information. A good caption would eliminate the emotional descriptors and resolve the positional contradiction.",
