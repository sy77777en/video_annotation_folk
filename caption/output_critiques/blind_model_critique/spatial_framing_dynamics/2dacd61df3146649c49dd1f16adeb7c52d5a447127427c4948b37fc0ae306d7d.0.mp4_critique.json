    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an abandoned hallway, capturing the full length and breadth of the corridor. The camera remains at a consistent height, roughly at eye level, providing a clear view of the entire scene. The graffiti-covered walls occupy the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. On the right side, large windows line the wall, positioned in the middle ground and background, allowing natural light to enter. The floor, marked with cracks and debris, spans the bottom of the frame from the foreground to the background. A pile of rubble is visible in the middle ground on the left side. The ceiling, showing signs of wear, is situated at the top of the frame, running continuously from the foreground to the background. As the camera moves forward, the perspective shifts slightly, maintaining the same shot size while bringing different sections of the hallway into clearer view. The initial and final states of the shot remain consistent in terms of framing, with the camera steadily advancing through the corridor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is an interior scenery shot of an abandoned hallway. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The hallway is long and narrow, with walls covered in colorful graffiti, adding a sense of urban decay. The ceiling and floor show signs of wear, with debris scattered throughout. Large windows line one side, allowing natural light to filter in, highlighting the dilapidated state. The overall mood is one of neglect and abandonment, emphasizing the scale and emptiness of the space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a long, narrow corridor in an abandoned building, characterized by its deteriorating condition and graffiti-covered walls. The setting is indoors, with large windows on one side allowing natural light to filter in, casting a muted glow over the scene. The walls are adorned with colorful graffiti, featuring various shapes and markings, adding a chaotic yet vibrant element to the otherwise decaying environment. The floor is cracked and littered with debris, leading to a pile of rubble located midway down the corridor. The ceiling shows signs of wear, with peeling paint and exposed materials. The overall atmosphere is one of neglect and abandonment, with the corridor stretching into the distance, emphasizing the building's desolate state.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the scene as a wide shot of a hallway and correctly identifies all the major visual elements: graffiti-covered walls, windows, a debris-strewn floor, a pile of rubble, and a worn ceiling. The description of the camera movement as a steady forward advance is also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness and Adherence to Instructions:** The caption meticulously follows all the instructions provided:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the \"wide shot.\"\n    *   **Spatial Framing (2D and 3D):** It successfully describes both the 2D position (e.g., \"left and right sides,\" \"bottom,\" \"top\") and the 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground to the background,\" \"middle ground\") for each key element mentioned (walls, windows, floor, rubble, ceiling).\n    *   **Camera Height:** It specifies the camera's position as \"at a consistent height, roughly at eye level.\"\n    *   **Dynamics and Movement:** It clearly describes the camera's forward movement and its effect on the perspective, correctly noting that the overall shot size and framing remain consistent.\n\n*   **Clarity and Style:** The caption is written in simple, natural English. It is a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to read and understand. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"abandoned\" and \"signs of wear\" are acceptable as they describe the physical state of the scene based on visual evidence) and speculative language, sticking to a factual and objective description of the spatial arrangement and dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a wide shot of an abandoned hallway, capturing the entire length and width of the corridor. The camera maintains a consistent height, approximately at eye level, offering a clear view of the scene. Graffiti-covered walls line the left and right sides of the frame, stretching from the foreground to the background. On the right, large windows are positioned in the middle ground and background, allowing natural light to filter in. The floor, marked with cracks and debris, extends across the bottom of the frame from the foreground to the background. A pile of rubble is visible in the middle ground on the left. The ceiling, showing signs of wear, runs continuously at the top of the frame from the foreground to the background. As the camera moves forward, the perspective shifts slightly, maintaining the same shot size while bringing different sections of the hallway into clearer view.
