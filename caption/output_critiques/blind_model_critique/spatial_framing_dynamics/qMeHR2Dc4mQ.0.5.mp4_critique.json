    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a man's face, which is consistently positioned in the center foreground against a dark background. Only the collar of his jacket is visible at the bottom of the frame. Initially, the man looks directly forward. His gaze then briefly shifts to his right (the viewer's left) before returning to look forward again. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin, short dark curly hair, and dark eyes is shown in a close-up. He has a dark mustache and some stubble on his chin. A small, light-colored blemish is visible on his right cheek. He wears a dark, possibly green or black, jacket, with only the collar visible. He looks straight ahead with a neutral expression, briefly glancing to his right before returning his gaze forward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a very dark environment, with the background appearing almost entirely black. The lighting is dim, focused primarily on a man's face, which is centered in the shot. The man has dark, curly hair and a mustache. His eyes shift slightly during the video. The overall impression is of an indoor setting at night or a space with minimal illumination.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject's central framing and gaze shift, but it overlooks several key spatial details. The shot is more of a tight close-up, as the top of the man's head is slightly cropped by the upper edge of the frame, making the composition feel more intimate and constrained than a standard close-up might imply. The description of the man's movement is incomplete; when his gaze shifts to the viewer's left, his head also tilts slightly in that direction, which is a notable change in his spatial orientation. Most importantly, the caption incorrectly states the camera is static. In reality, the camera performs a very slow, subtle push-in, gradually tightening the frame around the man's face and transitioning from a close-up to an extreme close-up by the end of the shot. This movement is a critical dynamic element that alters the viewer's proximity to the subject. Additionally, the caption could mention that the man is lit by a single, strong key light from the upper left, which casts a pronounced shadow across the right side of his face, creating a sense of volume and separating him more distinctly from the dark background.",
