    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot captured from an eye-level perspective. The composition is defined by a rapid camera pan from right to left, which creates extreme horizontal motion blur across the entire frame. In the background, multi-story buildings are visible on the left and in the center. A large, light-colored vehicle occupies the center of the middle ground, its shape elongated and distorted by the camera's swift movement. The street and sidewalk fill the foreground and middle ground, with a few blurred figures positioned in the foreground on the left. The primary dynamic is the camera's motion, which streaks all light sources and blurs the scene's elements into horizontal lines.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video is a dynamic cityscape scenery shot taken at night. The scene is characterized by a significant motion blur that streaks the lights from buildings and street lamps, creating an energetic and slightly disorienting effect. In the background, multi-story European-style buildings with illuminated windows line a street, while a large, light-colored vehicle, possibly a tour bus, moves through the center of the frame, its form elongated and distorted by the camera's movement. There is no main subject, as the intentional blur and rapid motion shift the focus to the overall atmosphere and kinetic energy of the urban environment rather than any specific person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a rapid, motion-blurred view of a city street at night. The scene is set in a square lined with multi-story, historic-style buildings, their windows and storefronts glowing with warm light. The fast movement of the camera blurs the surroundings, stretching light sources into long horizontal streaks across the frame. A large white bus is visible in the center, its form and lights distorted by the motion. The pavement reflects the ambient illumination from streetlights and shops, while indistinct figures of people occupy the sidewalks.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main camera movement and key elements, it could be more precise about the visual style and the spatial interplay of objects. The description of the camera as \"eye-level\" is ambiguous; a \"low-angle\" or \"vehicle-mounted\" perspective would be more accurate, given the implied speed and the way the street fills the lower frame. The caption mentions the primary dynamic of light streaking at the end, but this hyperlapse or long-exposure effect is the most dominant visual characteristic and should be established at the beginning to contextualize why all elements are blurred. The description of the bus passing \"as the camera pans left\" is slightly imprecise; it would be clearer to state that as the camera begins its turn, the bus enters from the left foreground and rapidly crosses to the right, momentarily obscuring the buildings in the middle ground. Furthermore, the \"blurred figures\" could be located more specifically, for instance, \"on the sidewalk in the bottom right foreground.\" Finally, the description of the buildings after the turn could be enhanced by noting how the new central background buildings create a new vanishing point, contrasting with the initial one-point perspective of the first street.",
