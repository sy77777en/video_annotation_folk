    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of two main subjects in a starkly lit, black-and-white scene. Initially, the young boy with dark, curly hair and a striped jacket is positioned on the left side of the frame, in the middle ground, facing right in profile. Beside him, in the center of the frame, stands another figure with their head wrapped in wire or string, also in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing their upper bodies. The boy turns his head to face forward, changing his expression to wide-eyed, while the second figure remains still. The scene is framed with a dark, out-of-focus shoulder in the foreground on the right, indicating an over-the-shoulder perspective. The background remains pitch-black, emphasizing the focused light on the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a starkly lit, black-and-white scene, a young boy with dark, curly hair and a striped jacket is positioned on the right. He is initially in profile, then turns to look forward with a wide-eyed expression. To his left, in the center of the frame, stands another person whose entire head is completely wrapped in what appears to be wire or string, obscuring all facial features. This second figure wears a dark, thick coat and remains still.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From an over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind a character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, the black-and-white shot is set in a dark, undefined space. A single, focused light source from the right illuminates two figures against a pitch-black background. On the left, a young boy in a ribbed jacket is seen in profile, looking towards the right. Beside him is a figure wearing a dark coat, whose head is completely obscured by a dense wrapping of a string-like or wire-like material. The dark, out-of-focus shoulder of the viewpoint character is visible in the foreground. The boy's expression changes as he looks up with wide eyes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed instructions. It successfully translates the visual information into a concise, objective, and spatially-aware description.\n\n**Detailed Feedback:**\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is very accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a medium shot, the black-and-white aesthetic, the number of subjects, and their key features. The spatial positioning (boy on the left, figure in the center, shoulder on the right), depth (shoulder in foreground, subjects in middle ground, black background), and camera height (at the subjects' level) are all described precisely. The key action—the boy turning his head—is also captured correctly.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is thorough. It covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"medium shot.\"\n    *   **Position (2D & 3D):** It successfully describes the 2D position (left, center, right) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) for multiple elements (the two subjects, the shoulder, and the background).\n    *   **Camera Height:** Clearly stated as \"at the subjects' level.\"\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It effectively describes the initial state (boy in profile) and the change (boy turns to face forward), while noting the other figure remains static.\n    *   **Framing:** It correctly identifies the \"over-the-shoulder perspective\" created by the foreground element.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The paragraph is well-structured, clear, and uses simple, natural English without being overly simplistic.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. For example, it describes the boy's expression as \"wide-eyed\" (an objective observation) rather than \"scared\" or \"surprised\" (a subjective interpretation). The use of \"starkly lit\" is acceptable as it describes the high-contrast quality of the light, which is a visual fact.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The caption avoids speculative language like \"it seems\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   **Format:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\n**Minor Point for Improvement:**\n*   The phrase \"wire or string\" is a very slight deviation from the instruction to \"Avoid... ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" While the material is visually ambiguous, a more definitive phrasing like \"wrapped in thin strands\" or \"a wire-like material\" would align more strictly with the rule. However, this is a minor point in an otherwise outstanding caption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is a high-quality example that demonstrates a strong understanding of all the instructions. It is an effective and objective description of the video's spatial framing and dynamics.",
