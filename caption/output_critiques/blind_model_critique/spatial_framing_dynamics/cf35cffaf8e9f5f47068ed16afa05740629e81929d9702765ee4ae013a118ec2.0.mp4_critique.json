    "pre_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a vast landscape, showcasing rolling hills and rocky outcrops under a broad sky. The camera is positioned at a high vantage point, providing a panoramic view of the terrain. In the frame, the hills occupy the background, while the rocky outcrops are positioned in the middle ground, slightly off-center to the left. The foreground is dominated by dry grass and scattered rocks, creating texture. Grazing cattle are dispersed throughout the middle ground, blending into the landscape, with some positioned towards the bottom left and others more centrally located. As the video progresses, the camera shifts slightly, maintaining the extreme wide shot but altering the angle to reveal more of the distant hills and the grazing cattle, enhancing the sense of depth and scale within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, open expanse of rolling hills and rocky outcrops under a wide, expansive sky. The terrain is covered with dry grass, and scattered rocks add texture to the scene, while a herd of cattle grazes peacefully, blending into the natural environment. The distant hills create a sense of depth and scale, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape. The focus is on the serene atmosphere and the expansive environment rather than any specific object, highlighting the harmony between the land and the sky, and the tranquil coexistence of nature and wildlife.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures a sweeping view of a vast, open landscape during the day. The setting is outdoors, featuring rolling hills covered with dry, golden grass and scattered rocky outcrops. In the distance, a range of low, undulating mountains stretches across the horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The terrain is dotted with grazing cattle, their dark brown bodies contrasting against the lighter earth tones. Small clusters of trees and a few distant structures are visible, suggesting a rural environment. The drone's perspective provides a broad, panoramic view, emphasizing the expansive and serene nature of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the extreme wide shot and the general layering of the landscape, but its description of movement is too vague. The term \"shifts slightly\" fails to specify the camera's action; a more precise term like \"slowly pans to the right\" would be more informative. This imagined pan would cause the rocky outcrops, initially \"off-center to the left,\" to drift toward the left edge of the frame, a dynamic detail that is currently missing. The caption also neglects to describe the movement of the cattle themselves. For instance, the cattle in the foreground could be moving slowly from right to left, creating a subtle counter-motion to the camera's pan. Additionally, the description of the cattle as \"dispersed\" is imprecise; it would be clearer to state that a main herd is clustered in the middle ground while a few individual animals occupy the foreground. The statement that the camera reveals \"more of the distant hills\" could be improved by describing what specifically comes into view, such as a previously unseen valley or a peak on the right side of the frame.",
