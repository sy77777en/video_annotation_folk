    "pre_caption": "This full shot, captured from a high angle, shows an adult elephant and a baby elephant in the middle ground. The adult elephant occupies the center-right of the frame, while the baby stands beneath it in the center. They are surrounded by dense, tall green grass and foliage that fills the foreground and background. A patch of lighter-colored plants is visible in the bottom-left foreground. The camera remains static throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An adult elephant and a baby elephant are seen amidst tall, dense green grass and foliage. The large adult elephant, with its grey, wrinkled skin, is positioned with its side to the viewer, partially concealed by the vegetation. Standing beside and slightly underneath the adult is a much smaller baby elephant, also with grey, wrinkled skin. The baby elephant is facing away from the viewer, with its rear visible, and appears to be nursing from the adult.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a slightly elevated perspective, an adult elephant and a calf are seen amidst a dense expanse of tall, vibrant green grass and leafy foliage. The large, gray adult elephant is partially concealed by the thick undergrowth, while the smaller calf stands close to its side. The scene is set in a lush, natural environment during the day, with the gray, textured skin of the elephants contrasting with the surrounding greenery.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly establishes the full shot and the general positioning of the elephants, but it lacks detail on the subjects' movements, which are central to the scene's spatial dynamics. The adult elephant is not completely still; it slowly sways its body and periodically flaps its large ears, which momentarily extend further into the left and right sides of the frame. The description of the baby as simply \"beneath\" the adult is too general; it is specifically tucked between the adult's front legs, with its body angled toward the right side of the frame. Furthermore, the baby elephant is actively moving, occasionally nudging the adult's leg with its head and curling its trunk, creating small but significant shifts in its position within the central middle ground. The description of the foliage is also incomplete, as the background is not uniformly dense; a clearing in the top-right background reveals a distant, out-of-focus tree line, which adds more depth to the scene than the caption suggests. Incorporating these movements and more precise spatial relationships would better capture the dynamic nature of the shot.",
