    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a cityscape at sunset, with the scenery as the main focus. Initially, the upper two-thirds of the frame are occupied by a sky filled with clouds illuminated in warm, golden tones. The lower third of the frame shows a dark silhouette of trees and buildings in the middle ground. The camera then performs a slow pan from left to right. As the camera moves, the bright, setting sun enters the frame from the bottom right, positioned just above the silhouetted treeline. This movement also reveals more of the cityscape, including a distant silhouette of taller buildings in the background on the far right. The camera maintains a high-angle perspective throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a panoramic cityscape scenery shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a sunset. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural light display against the urban backdrop. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a vast sky filled with scattered clouds illuminated in warm hues of orange, yellow, and gold by the setting sun. Below, the city is reduced to a dark silhouette of buildings and trees, with the brilliant orb of the sun gradually emerging from behind the treeline on the right, casting a final, radiant glow across the horizon.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A sunset unfolds over a city skyline, with the view panning slowly from left to right. The sky is filled with warm tones of orange, yellow, and gold near the horizon, fading into a darker, dusky blue above. Scattered clouds, tinged with golden light, drift slowly across the expanse. The bright, glowing sun is visible on the horizon, partially obscured by the landscape. A dark silhouette of trees, including palms, and low-rise buildings occupies the middle ground, with some structures catching the last glint of sunlight. In the background, a silhouette of tall buildings and a mountain stands against the colorful sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the extreme wide shot and the general left-to-right pan, it misses a crucial element of depth by failing to mention the highway in the immediate foreground, where the faint headlights of moving cars are visible along the bottom edge of the frame. This omission makes the placement of the \"trees and buildings\" in the middle ground less clear. The description of the silhouette is also too generic; it neglects to specify the prominent radio tower on the left and the distinct shape of a crane on the right, which are key features within the middle ground. Furthermore, while the sun's entrance is noted, the caption fails to describe the significant, bright orange lens flare that momentarily expands from the bottom right corner as the sun crests the treeline. Finally, the camera movement is not just a simple pan; it also includes a very slow, subtle upward tilt that begins midway through the pan, serving to keep the newly revealed mountain range centered as more of the background is unveiled.",
