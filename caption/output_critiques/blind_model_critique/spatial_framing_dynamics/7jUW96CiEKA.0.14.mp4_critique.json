    "pre_caption": "This video uses an extreme wide shot to capture an expansive landscape. The sun is positioned in the top center-right of the frame, located in the background. The horizon line stretches across the middle of the frame, also in the background. The bottom half of the frame is occupied by a dense forest that extends from the foreground through the middle ground and into the background. A layer of mist is visible in the middle ground, nestled within the forest valleys. The camera remains static in a high-angle position, looking down over the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, expansive view of a natural environment, focusing on the atmosphere and scale rather than a specific object. The sun is prominently positioned in the sky, casting a warm, golden light over the scene. The horizon stretches across the frame, with layers of distant hills and a dense forest below. The emphasis is on the serene and expansive quality of the landscape, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow, and the tranquil, open space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an expansive outdoor landscape during sunrise. The scene features a vast, dense forest stretching towards the horizon, with a prominent sun casting a warm, golden hue across the sky. The sunlight creates a soft glow, illuminating the treetops and casting long shadows. The atmosphere is calm, with a slight haze visible in the distance, adding depth to the scene. The natural elements, including the varied textures of the trees and the gentle undulations of the terrain, are highlighted by the emerging light. The overall setting conveys a serene and tranquil environment, with the sun's position indicating the transition from morning to afternoon.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a solid overview of the static composition, it misses the opportunity to describe subtle movements and could be more specific about the spatial relationships. For instance, the description of the forest is general; it could be improved by detailing the immediate foreground, such as mentioning if silhouetted treetops or a specific ridge line anchor the bottom of the frame. The positioning of the sun as \"top center-right\" is slightly awkward and could be simplified to \"upper right,\" and its relationship to the horizon could be clarified—for example, specifying that it sits just above the distant hills on the horizon line. Most importantly, the caption states the camera is static but fails to mention any movement within the scene itself. In the video, the layer of mist is not static but drifts slowly from left to right through the valleys in the middle ground, and this dynamic element is a key part of the scene's atmosphere that is currently omitted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures an expansive landscape using an extreme wide shot. The sun is positioned in the upper right of the frame, sitting just above the distant hills on the horizon line, which stretches across the middle of the frame.

A layer of mist drifts slowly from left to right through the forest valleys in the middle ground, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The camera remains in a high-angle position, looking down over the scene, while the subtle movement of the mist enhances the atmosphere.",
