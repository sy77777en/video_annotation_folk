    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot from the subject's level, capturing a skateboarder in the right foreground moving through a skatepark. Animated smoke effects trail the skateboarder in the foreground, while an animated creature is positioned in the left middle ground. A city skyline is visible in the left background, with palm trees in the middle ground and background. The camera then tilts up and zooms in, transitioning to a full, low-angle shot of a large billboard that becomes the central subject in the middle ground. The city skyline is now in the background below the billboard. An animated iguana is on the billboard's left support structure in the middle ground, and an animated UFO is in the top right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins with a man skateboarding in a skatepark. He is wearing a purple shirt with a yellow and black striped pattern on its back, along with a helmet and knee pads, and he is positioned on the right side, leaning into a curve. The scene is vibrant, with colorful animated elements like a yellow and pink cloud and a floating multicolored object, adding a dynamic and playful atmosphere. The video transitions to a large, brightly lit billboard displaying the phrase \"The world is your canvas\" in bold, colorful letters. The billboard is elevated on a metal structure, with a city skyline visible in the background, enhancing the urban setting. The transition from the skatepark to the billboard suggests a theme of creativity and expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban setting at dusk, featuring a skatepark with smooth concrete surfaces and palm trees silhouetted against a colorful sky. In the background, a city skyline with illuminated buildings is visible, adding a vibrant urban contrast. The scene includes animated, colorful graffiti elements that appear to interact with the environment, such as bright, abstract shapes and figures. A prominent billboard displays the phrase \"The World is Your Canvas\" in vivid, multicolored lettering, enhancing the artistic and dynamic atmosphere. The overall scene combines natural and urban elements with creative, animated visuals, creating a lively and imaginative environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and below the subject when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects (skateboarder, billboard), the animated elements, and the background scenery. The description of the camera movement—a tilt up combined with a zoom—is precise. The spatial placements of all mentioned elements (e.g., skateboarder in the right foreground, creature in the left middle ground, billboard becoming central) are correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully describes both the initial and final states of the scene, detailing the transition between them. It covers the shot size, 2D position, 3D depth, and camera height for the key subjects and elements in both parts of the video, fulfilling all the core requirements of the prompt.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions.\n*   **Spatial Framing and Dynamics:** It focuses entirely on describing the spatial relationships and movements as requested.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** It is written in simple, natural English and is presented as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **All Required Details:** It systematically includes shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and the dynamics of change.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, thorough, and perfectly aligned with the prompt's objective to describe spatial framing and dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot at the subject's level, featuring a skateboarder in the right foreground moving through a skatepark. Animated smoke effects follow the skateboarder, while an animated creature appears in the left middle ground. A city skyline is visible in the left background, with palm trees scattered in the middle ground and background. The camera tilts up and zooms in, transitioning to a full, low-angle shot of a large billboard that becomes the central focus in the middle ground. The city skyline shifts to the background below the billboard. An animated iguana is perched on the billboard's left support structure in the middle ground, and an animated UFO hovers in the top right.",
