    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot. The video begins with an extreme wide shot where a bridge guardrail is in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A muddy river is in the bottom right middle ground, next to green rice paddies that fill the center. In the background, green hills are visible across the top half of the frame, with a village on the left. The camera then pans left, transitioning into a wide shot. The bridge and its guardrails now frame the bottom and sides of the shot, with its paved road leading from the bottom center into the middle ground. At the end of the bridge, a red ceremonial gate is now the central element in the middle ground, with the rice paddies and hills now positioned in the background on the right. The camera is positioned at eye level from the bridge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil rural area in Vietnam. The view from a concrete bridge overlooks a muddy brown river, expansive, vibrant green rice paddies, and distant, lushly forested hills under a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The camera pans to reveal that the bridge leads to the entrance of a small village, marked by a traditional red ceremonial gate adorned with colorful flags. There is no main subject, as the focus is on capturing the picturesque and serene atmosphere of the countryside, emphasizing the harmonious relationship between the natural landscape and the small community nestled within it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A daytime view from a bridge in a rural countryside setting shows a muddy brown river flowing alongside vibrant green rice paddies. In the distance, a small village with houses is nestled at the base of lush, rolling hills under a bright blue sky with white, puffy clouds. A metal utility pole stands in the green fields. The perspective moves across the bridge, which has a gray metal guardrail, revealing a paved road leading toward a large, red welcome gate adorned with colorful flags at the far end.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an extreme wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a wide shot.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the camera's pan and the main landscape elements, but it could improve the description of spatial relationships and dynamics. The initial placement of the river in the \"bottom right middle ground\" feels slightly inaccurate; if the guardrail is in the foreground, the river likely occupies the lower portion of the middle ground more broadly, perhaps flowing from left to right. The description of the pan is a bit abrupt, jumping from the initial to the final composition without detailing the transitional movement; for instance, it misses how the village on the left would grow more prominent before exiting the frame as the pan progresses. Furthermore, while the final shot correctly identifies the bridge framing and the gate's central position, it could more effectively describe the dynamic of the bridge's guardrails and road acting as strong leading lines that draw the viewer's eye from the foreground corners directly to the gate in the middle ground. Finally, the scene feels static; adding a detail like a lone motorcycle crossing the bridge toward the gate during the pan would add a layer of subject movement and better fulfill the \"spatial dynamics\" requirement of the prompt.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with an extreme wide shot, where a bridge guardrail is prominently in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. A muddy river flows broadly across the lower portion of the middle ground, moving from left to right, adjacent to expansive green rice paddies that dominate the center. In the background, lush green hills stretch across the top half of the frame, with a village visible on the left. As the camera pans left, the village becomes more prominent before gradually exiting the frame. The shot transitions smoothly into a wide view, with the bridge and its guardrails now framing the bottom and sides of the shot. The paved road of the bridge acts as a strong leading line, drawing the viewer's eye from the foreground corners directly to a red ceremonial gate, which becomes the central element in the middle ground. The rice paddies and hills shift to the background on the right. A lone motorcycle crosses the bridge toward the gate, adding a dynamic element of movement to the scene. The camera remains positioned at eye level from the bridge throughout the pan.",
