    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up shot focusing on a man wearing a spacesuit helmet. He is positioned slightly off-center, occupying the center-right portion of the frame, and is situated in the foreground. The background, featuring blurred vertical lines, is dimly lit and occupies the background space. The man's head moves slightly within the frame as he speaks, but his overall position remains relatively constant. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man wearing a white space suit with a helmet that has a clear visor. His face is visible through the visor, showing a light skin tone and short hair. The man appears to be speaking or reacting with an expressive face, as his mouth is open and his eyes are wide. The suit has visible details such as straps and connectors, typical of astronaut gear. The man is oriented towards the camera, and his facial expression suggests he is engaged in an intense or urgent situation.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video features a close-up view of a person wearing a spacesuit helmet indoors. The helmet is primarily white with grey and black sections, metallic silver trim around the neck ring, and visible scuff marks on its surface. The clear visor reflects some light sources. The background is dimly lit and blurred, showing vertical lines that suggest a textured wall or structure, possibly made of wood or metal.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the close-up shot and the subject's general position, but it overlooks several key spatial details. It fails to mention the helmet's large, reflective visor, which is a dominant element. In the video, reflections of a brightly lit control panel are visible on the visor's surface, creating a distinct foreground layer, while the man's face is visible through the glass, positioning it in the middle ground. This creates a more complex depth than the simple foreground/background description suggests. The description of movement as \"moves slightly\" is also too general; the man specifically turns his head slowly from a three-quarter profile on the right towards the center, causing his facial features to shift across the frame, which is a more significant dynamic than implied. Finally, the \"blurred vertical lines\" in the background are not static but are light strips that pulse rhythmically, adding a subtle but constant sense of movement to the background that contrasts with the subject's slow, deliberate motion.",
