    "pre_caption": "The video starts as a medium full shot from a high angle, showing a silhouetted person in the left middle ground standing by a large window. In the bottom-right foreground, the back of a second person's head is visible at a desk before it moves out of the frame. The first person, remaining in the left middle ground, raises a grappling hook device. As they aim it out the broken window, which occupies the center and right of the frame, the shot transitions to a medium shot, focusing more on the upper body of the standing individual. The cityscape is visible in the background through the window throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person in silhouette, wearing dark clothing and a red head covering, stands facing a broken window. Their facial features are mostly obscured, but a prominent nose is visible in profile. This individual holds and aims a dark, metallic, grappling hook-like device with a black cord out of the window. In the foreground, the back of a second person's head is visible until it moves out of the frame. This second person is wearing a clown mask with some visible hair at the back of it. The first person is positioned on the right of the frame, while the second person is positioned at the bottom right of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a high-rise office during daylight, with a large window offering a view of adjacent flat-roofed, light-colored stone buildings. The window glass is partially shattered. Inside, a desk is visible near the window, with a dark green bag and a coiled black cable resting on it. A silhouetted figure stands by the window, manipulating a dark, elongated object attached to the cable, while a second individual watches him impatiently before exiting the frame.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the initial shot as a \"medium full shot\" and correctly notes the \"high angle\" of the camera.\n*   It correctly places the main subject (\"silhouetted person\") in the \"left middle ground\" and the secondary subject (\"back of a second person's head\") in the \"bottom-right foreground.\"\n*   The description of the shot transitioning to a \"medium shot\" to focus on the upper body is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the required elements: shot size, 2D position (left, bottom-right, center), 3D position/depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and camera height (high angle).\n*   It effectively describes the spatial dynamics, including the secondary subject moving out of the frame and the primary subject's action of raising and aiming the device.\n*   It also includes the change in framing, clearly stating the initial and final shot sizes.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Structure:** The caption follows the requested structure perfectly, starting with the shot size and then detailing the spatial arrangement and movements of the subjects.\n*   **Language:** It uses simple, natural, and objective English as requested. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), and ambiguity. For example, \"silhouetted person\" is a factual description of their appearance due to the lighting, not a subjective interpretation.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise while remaining highly informative, capturing all the essential spatial details in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as instructed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to all stylistic and structural requirements.",
