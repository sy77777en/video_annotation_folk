    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from a static, top-down perspective, showing a topographical map in the background that fills the frame. In the foreground, an orange marker labeled \"WASHINGTON\" is positioned in the lower right. To its northwest, in the center-left area, a blue marker identifies the \"FLIGHT 93 CRASH SITE.\" A dashed blue line in the foreground connects these two points. A solid blue line animates across the upper portion of the frame, also in the foreground; it originates in the top left, moves southeast, makes a U-turn, and then travels down to the crash site marker.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a dark, detailed map with highlighted elements. A prominent orange circle marks \"Washington,\" while a blue circle indicates the \"Flight 93 Crash Site.\" Blue lines connect these points, suggesting a route or path. The map's intricate lines and textures provide a geographical context, emphasizing the locations' significance. The overall visual is focused on these key points and their connection.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene displays a dark, topographical map of the eastern United States, showing the mountainous terrain of the Appalachian region. Several graphical overlays are present. An orange circular marker and text label \"WASHINGTON\" in the lower right. To the northwest, a blue circular marker and text identify the \"FLIGHT 93 CRASH SITE.\" A solid blue line, representing a flight path, animates from the upper left, makes a U-turn, and terminates at the crash site. A dashed blue line extends from the crash site marker southeast toward the Washington marker.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the static, top-down perspective, the topographical map in the background, the two markers in the foreground, and their respective labels and positions (orange \"WASHINGTON\" in the lower right, blue \"FLIGHT 93 CRASH SITE\" in the center-left).\n*   The description of the animated solid blue line's path is precise and detailed, correctly tracing its movement from the top left, southeast, through a U-turn, and down to the crash site marker.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption effectively describes the shot size by stating the map \"fills the frame,\" which is appropriate for this type of top-down view.\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** The caption excels here. It clearly separates elements into `background` (map) and `foreground` (markers, lines) and provides specific 2D positions (`lower right`, `center-left`, `top left`, `upper portion`).\n*   **Camera Height:** This is clearly stated as a \"top-down perspective.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The animation, which is the key dynamic element, is described in comprehensive detail, covering its origin, path, and destination.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It is concise yet informative, focusing strictly on spatial framing and movement.\n*   It successfully avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and any information not visible in the video.\n*   It follows all formatting requirements, returning only the description without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions, providing a clear, objective, and spatially detailed account of the video's content.",
