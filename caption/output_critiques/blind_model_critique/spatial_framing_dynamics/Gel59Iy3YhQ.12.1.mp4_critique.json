    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, scenery shot of a futuristic industrial room, captured from an eye-level, first-person perspective. Initially, a bright blue holographic console is positioned in the center-right background, while a large, red-glowing window occupies the left middle ground. A metal door is visible in the center-left background, with a fire extinguisher to its right. In the bottom-left foreground, a pile of debris rests on the floor. The camera then performs a slow pan to the left. This movement shifts the red window and an adjacent wall panel with a flashing light towards the center of the frame, while the holographic console moves to the far-right background. The debris in the foreground remains in its initial position throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a scenery shot of a dimly lit, futuristic industrial interior. The room is constructed from gray, metallic panels, with a large, rounded window on the left emitting an ominous red glow. In the background, a bright blue holographic console casts a stark light on a workstation, contrasting with the surrounding gloom. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to establish the environment's tense and mysterious atmosphere. The focus is on the interplay of light and shadow, the functional yet worn state of the room, and the sense of place rather than on any specific character or object. Details like a flashing red light on a wall panel, a fire extinguisher, and scattered debris on the floor contribute to the scene's lived-in, slightly distressed feel.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dimly lit, industrial room with metallic paneled walls and a metallic paneled floor. In the background, a bright cyan holographic screen glows on a desk, illuminating the area. To the left is a large window with a red, hazy view and a visible \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign. A heavy metal door is situated on the back wall, with a red fire extinguisher mounted beside it. Debris, including what looks like woodena planks, is scattered on the floor in the foreground. A small point in the center of the frame likely serves as an aiming reticle typical in first-person games.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is precise and fact-based. It uses specific, objective language to describe the scene's elements (\"holographic console,\" \"fire extinguisher\"), their visual properties (\"bright blue,\" \"red-glowing\"), and their exact spatial relationships. It accurately identifies the camera movement as a \"slow pan to the left.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally thorough. It successfully covers all the required points from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size and Perspective:** It correctly starts by identifying the \"wide, scenery shot\" and the \"eye-level, first-person perspective.\"\n    *   **Initial and Final States:** It clearly separates the initial layout of the scene from the final layout after the camera movement, describing how elements shift within the frame (e.g., the console moves from \"center-right\" to \"far-right\").\n    *   **2D and 3D Positioning:** For every major element, it provides both its position within the frame (2D: \"center-right,\" \"left,\" \"bottom-left\") and its depth in the scene (3D: \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\").\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It not only describes the camera pan but also explains the effect of this movement on the composition, including noting which element remains static (\"The debris... remains in its initial position\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n    *   **Tone and Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. Descriptors like \"futuristic\" and \"industrial\" define the style of the room, which is an objective observation of its design.\n    *   **Focus:** The entire paragraph is dedicated to the core task of describing spatial framing and dynamics, without any extraneous information.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, concise, and provides a comprehensive and accurate spatial description of the video's content and movement.",
