    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle full shot, a single figure sits in the background, centered in the corner of a room. This main subject is surrounded by several other figures that occupy the foreground and middle ground. A prominent figure is positioned in the left foreground with its back to the camera, while other figures are visible in the right foreground and middle ground, all facing towards the sitting figure in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject is a stylized, low-polygon human figure sitting hunched in a corner with its back against two walls. This figure has a light-colored, geometric body, a faceless head, and dark, blocky hair. It is surrounded by several other standing, low-polygon figures, which are rendered in a uniform, light bluish-white color and are also faceless. These surrounding figures are all oriented towards the sitting figure, looking down upon it as if cornering it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit, blue-tinted corner of a room with textured walls, a scene is captured from an objective perspective. The camera is positioned behind several standing, low-polygon, faceless figures, looking down at another stylized humanoid figure with dark hair who is sitting on the floor in the corner. The entire scene is rendered in a low-polygon, geometric style. An overlay of yellow subtitles appears at the bottom of the screen, with text that reads, \"there's a lot of physical abuses happening,\" \"especially when you are new there,\" and \"They will try to discipline you.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the high-angle perspective and the general distribution of figures across the foreground, middle ground, and background. However, the description could be more precise about the spatial relationships and dynamics. The phrase \"centered in the corner\" is confusing; it would be clearer to state that the figure is centered within the frame while positioned in the far corner of the room. The term \"full shot\" is also potentially misleading for a multi-subject scene with significant depth; a \"wide shot\" might be more appropriate, as the foreground figures are likely only partially visible. The caption lacks specificity regarding the \"several other figures,\" failing to describe their postures (e.g., some standing, some kneeling) which would better define the vertical space. Furthermore, the description implies a static image, but the video could contain subtle movements; for example, the foreground figures might be slightly shifting their weight or gesturing, creating a dynamic that funnels attention toward the still figure in the background, a detail that is currently missing.",
