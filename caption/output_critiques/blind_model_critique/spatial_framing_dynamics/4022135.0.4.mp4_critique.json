    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle medium shot from the upper stands, featuring spectators in the foreground who occupy the lower right portion of the frame. A purple railing runs along the bottom edge. In the middle ground to the left, a portion of the football field is visible, while the opposite stands and a large building inscribed with \"RYAN FIELD\" are positioned in the middle ground and background on the right. The camera then pans left, shifting the composition to a wide, high-angle shot of the stadium. As the pan concludes, the initial spectators are no longer in view, replaced by the back of a person's head in the bottom center foreground. The football field now dominates the middle ground, stretching across the frame, with the expansive, crowded stands on the far side filling the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a scene at a crowded outdoor football stadium from the perspective of the audience. In the foreground, a fair-skinned man with short, graying hair is seen from the side, wearing a dark baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt. He is sitting and looking towards the field. Next to him are other spectators, including a man in a white baseball cap and a gray jacket, and another man in a blue long-sleeved shirt. The stands are packed with a large crowd of people, many of whom are wearing purple and yellow clothing. Below, on the green football field marked with white lines, two teams of players in uniforms are visible from a distance. The word \"WILDCATS\" is painted in large purple letters in the end zone. The camera pans to the left, revealing a wider view of the stadium, the full expanse of the field, and the packed stands on the opposite side under an overcast sky. A large, light-colored building with a tower stands behind the far end of the stadium.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A wide shot from the upper stands of a crowded football stadium, Ryan Field, captures a game under an overcast sky. The green field below is marked with white yard lines and features a large purple end zone with \"WILDCATS\" written in white. Two teams are visible on the field near the touchlines. The stadium is filled with thousands of spectators, many dressed in purple, packing the stands on all sides. In the background, beyond the stadium, a dense line of green trees is visible, with a city skyline in the far distance. A prominent beige-colored building with \"RYAN FIELD\" inscribed on its side stands on the right of the stadium. The perspective pans to the left, offering a broader view of the entire stadium and the game unfolding below.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an outdoor sports stadium during a game, with the stands full of spectators. The camera is positioned among the audience. At the start, the foreground shows a medium shot of some spectators from the left rear of them, occupying the lower left corner of the frame. The remaining space shows a more distant view of the stands and the stadium. The camera then pans left, showing a wider view of the stadium and the opposite stands.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It meticulously follows all instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and stylistically correct.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption provides a precise and objective description of the visual information. It correctly identifies key elements like the spectators, the purple railing, the football field, the stands, and the \"RYAN FIELD\" building. The description of the camera movement (a left pan) and the resulting change in composition is logical and spatially accurate.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully incorporates all the required descriptive elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial \"medium shot\" and the transition to a \"wide... shot.\"\n    *   **Position (2D and 3D):** It consistently provides both the 2D position (e.g., \"lower right,\" \"bottom center,\" \"to the left\") and the 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for all major elements.\n    *   **Height:** It correctly establishes the \"high-angle\" perspective at the beginning and notes its consistency.\n    *   **Changes/Dynamics:** It clearly describes the \"pans left\" camera movement and details the spatial consequences: the initial spectators disappear, a new person's head appears in the foreground, and the field and far stands become the dominant elements in the new composition.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption strictly adheres to all stylistic and content-related rules:\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"exciting\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\"). The words \"expansive\" and \"crowded\" are used as objective descriptors of scale and density, which is appropriate.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the **spatial framing and dynamics**, as requested, providing a clear picture of how the scene is composed and how that composition changes over time.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a high-angle medium shot from the upper stands, showing spectators in the lower right of the frame, with a purple railing along the bottom edge. To the left in the middle ground, part of the football field is visible, while the opposite stands and a large building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" are in the middle ground and background on the right. The camera pans left, transitioning to a wide, high-angle shot of the stadium. As the pan ends, the initial spectators are out of view, replaced by the back of a person's head in the bottom center foreground. The football field now spans the middle ground, with the expansive, crowded stands on the far side filling the background.",
