    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a serene forest during sunrise. The entire frame captures the expansive view of the forest, with tall, slender trees occupying the middle ground and background. These trees are evenly distributed across the scene, with their trunks forming vertical lines from the bottom to the top of the frame. The foreground is filled with vibrant purple and green wildflowers, covering the ground densely. Sunlight streams through the trees, creating bright spots and casting shadows on the flowers and the forest floor. The sun's rays are prominently visible in the center-right portion of the frame, radiating outward. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective at eye level relative to the trees, emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of the forest setting. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial position of the elements within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the interplay of light through the trees and the vibrant colors of the flowers. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and beauty of the forest setting rather than a specific object, creating a sense of tranquility and immersion in nature.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a serene forest setting during sunrise, with sunlight streaming through tall, slender trees. The ground is carpeted with vibrant purple and green wildflowers, creating a colorful contrast against the dark tree trunks. Butterflies flutter among the flowers, adding to the enchanting atmosphere of the scene. The sun's rays filter through the foliage, casting a warm, golden glow across the scene. The atmosphere is calm and natural, with the interplay of light and shadow enhancing the tranquil beauty of the forest.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements and their spatial arrangement. It correctly identifies the trees in the middle ground and background, the wildflowers in the foreground, and the position of the sun's rays in the center-right of the frame. The description of the static camera and the lack of movement is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required components from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D/3D):** Effectively describes the foreground (wildflowers), middle ground/background (trees), and the 2D position of the sun's rays (center-right).\n*   **Height:** Mentions the camera is at \"eye level relative to the trees.\"\n*   **Changes:** Explicitly states that the camera is stationary and there are no changes in framing.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most instructions but fails on one critical point:\n\n*   **Strengths:** It follows the structure well, starting with shot size and then detailing the spatial composition. It uses simple, natural English and avoids speculative statements. The paragraph is coherent and provides a clear spatial map of the scene.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The primary violation is the use of emotional and subjective language. The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption includes \"serene,\" \"vibrant,\" and the concluding phrase \"emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of the forest setting.\" These words describe the mood and interpret the effect of the shot rather than objectively describing its spatial properties. A better caption would remove these subjective terms to focus purely on the physical and spatial description.",
