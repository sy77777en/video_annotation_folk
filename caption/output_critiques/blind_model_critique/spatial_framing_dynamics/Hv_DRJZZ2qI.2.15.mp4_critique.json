    "pre_caption": "The video is presented as an extreme wide shot, with the camera positioned below the subjects. Initially, a cyclist is captured mid-backflip in the upper center-left of the frame, on a high, light-colored rocky ridge which forms part of the middle ground. Two observers are visible in the bottom right of the frame, positioned further down the steep, brown mountainside, also in the middle ground. The expansive, rugged, and layered mountainside dominates the background and extends into the middle ground. The cyclist completes the trick and then moves downwards and to the right, descending the steep slope. Throughout this movement, the cyclist remains in the middle ground, transitioning from their initial upper center-left position towards the center-right portion of the frame, eventually being positioned above and to the left of the observers, who remain static in the bottom right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person wearing a yellow helmet, a black long-sleeved top, and black pants performs a backflip on a black bicycle down a steep, light brown, rocky slope. Further down the slope, to the right, two other people are visible. One, positioned lowest, wears a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. The second, slightly above and to the left of the first, wears a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and khaki pants. These two individuals appear to be observing the cyclist.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor scene on a rugged, arid mountainside characterized by steep, layered rock formations in shades of brown and tan. Sparse, dry, greenish-brown vegetation dots the landscape. During what appears to be daytime, a mountain biker is seen performing a trick on a high ridge before descending a steep, uneven slope. Two people are visible at the base of the incline, observing from below.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's placement of both the cyclist and the observers in the middle ground feels inaccurate; given the low camera angle and the observers being positioned \"further down the steep... mountainside,\" it is more likely the observers are in the foreground, which would create a more distinct sense of depth relative to the cyclist on the ridge. The description of the cyclist's movement is also somewhat general; as the cyclist descends, they likely move from the middle ground toward the foreground, causing the shot to transition from an extreme wide shot to a wide or medium shot, a significant change in framing that is not mentioned. Furthermore, the caption states the observers shift position within the frame but fails to specify if they exit the frame, which is probable as the camera pans right to follow the cyclist. Finally, while the camera starts below the subjects, it misses a key dynamic: as the cyclist descends the slope, the camera's relative height likely changes, potentially ending at eye-level or even in a high-angle position relative to the cyclist, a crucial shift from the initial low-angle setup.",
