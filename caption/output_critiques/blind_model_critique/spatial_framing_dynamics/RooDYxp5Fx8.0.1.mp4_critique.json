    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, eye-level scenery shot that begins with the Gojo Station entrance positioned in the center-right middle ground. To the left, a sidewalk stretches from the foreground into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings. A bicycle with a green delivery bag is parked in the bottom-left foreground. On the right side of the frame, a delivery truck and a circular traffic sign occupy the middle ground. In the background, visible through the station's opening and beyond the street, are more buildings and distant green mountains under a blue sky. The camera slowly and steadily moves forward, pushing in towards the station entrance, which causes the elements in the frame to grow larger. Pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalk on the left. A weather information graphic is overlaid in the lower-center foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a vibrant Japanese street scene on a bright, sunny day, with a particular emphasis on the modern, grey, arched entrance to Gojo Station, prominently featured in the center of the frame. The urban environment and atmosphere are highlighted, with pedestrians and a cyclist moving along the pavement lined with multi-story buildings. In the background, traffic flows down the street, and green mountains are visible under a clear blue sky, completing the urban landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a bright, sunny day on a city street in front of Gojo Station in Japan. The camera slowly moves toward the modern, gray, arched subway entrance, which is marked with signs in Japanese and English. The sidewalk to the left is lined with multi-story buildings, one of which has a traditional wooden storefront. On the right, a delivery truck is parked near a red and blue circular traffic sign. In the background, more buildings and a distant green mountain are visible under a clear blue sky. Pedestrians walk along the pavement, and a bicycle with a green delivery bag is parked in the foreground. An overlay in the lower center of the scene displays a sun icon with the text '35°C / 95 F' and 'Sunny weather'.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its use of descriptive terminology. It correctly identifies the shot size (\"wide\"), camera height (\"eye-level\"), and camera movement (\"moves forward, pushing in\").\n*   It precisely places multiple elements using both 2D coordinates (\"center-right,\" \"bottom-left\") and 3D depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\").\n*   The description of the effect of the camera movement (\"causes the elements in the frame to grow larger\") is an accurate observation of spatial dynamics.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The description is very thorough. It accounts for the main structure (station), foreground details (bicycle, graphic), middle ground elements (truck, sign), and background scenery (buildings, mountains).\n*   It successfully captures both static composition at the start and the dynamic change caused by the camera movement.\n*   It includes the movement of secondary subjects (\"Pedestrians can be seen walking\") and even a non-diegetic overlay (\"weather information graphic\"), demonstrating a comprehensive analysis of the frame.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Spatial Framing:** The caption perfectly fulfills the core instruction to describe spatial framing and dynamics. Every sentence contributes to building a clear mental map of the scene's layout and movement.\n*   **Language and Tone:** It uses simple, objective, and natural English, avoiding emotional adjectives or speculative phrases like \"it seems\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph as requested. It logically starts with the overall shot, details the static elements from foreground to background, and then describes the movement.\n*   **Required Elements:** It successfully incorporates all the required details: shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and spatial changes.",
