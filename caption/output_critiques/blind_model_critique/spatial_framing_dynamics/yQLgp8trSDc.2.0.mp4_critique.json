    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a full shot of a man positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground. In the background, a vertical plaque is visible near the center, and a large circular object is on the far left. The shot then rapidly transitions to a medium close-up, centering the man in the frame. In the final composition, the plaque is now in the background on the left. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man of East Asian descent with black hair styled back and a thin mustache is shown in a martial arts stance. He wears a dark blue, long-sleeved tunic. His expression is intense and focused as he holds his hands up in a preparatory or defensive pose.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit space with dark, textured walls, resembling a training hall or courtyard. In the background, a vertical wooden plaque with a gold border and prominent gold Chinese characters is mounted on the wall. To the left, a large, light-colored circular object, likely a Taiji Bagua diagram, is partially visible. A man in a dark tunic occupies the central area of this space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the initial and final shot sizes and the subject's position, but it could be more precise about the camera movement and its consequences. The term \"rapidly transitions\" is ambiguous; a more specific description like \"the camera quickly dollies in\" would better explain the visual shift, especially since the plaque's relative position changes from center to left, suggesting a physical camera move rather than a digital zoom. The caption also fails to mention what happens to the \"large circular object\" on the left after the transition; it should clarify that this element moves out of the frame. Furthermore, while the change in the plaque's position is noted, the description misses a key spatial dynamic: the likely change in depth of field. In the final medium close-up, the plaque in the background would probably become significantly more out of focus, a detail that is crucial for describing the final spatial composition. Finally, describing the man as simply \"positioned\" is static; a more active verb like \"stands\" would provide a clearer image of the scene.",

In the background, a vertical plaque is visible near the center, and a large circular object is on the far left. The camera quickly dollies in to a medium close-up, centering the man in the frame. In this final composition, the plaque is now in the background on the left and likely becomes significantly more out of focus, enhancing the depth of field. The large circular object moves out of the frame during this transition. Throughout the shot, the camera remains at the subject's level.",
