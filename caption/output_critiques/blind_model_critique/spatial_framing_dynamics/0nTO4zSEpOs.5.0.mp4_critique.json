    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an indoor urban setting, capturing a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The camera remains at eye level throughout, providing a consistent perspective of the environment. Initially, the walkway stretches into the background, with the ceiling's exposed beams and smooth flooring dominating the upper and lower portions of the frame. On the right side, large windows or glass walls reveal well-lit interiors, likely shops or restaurants, situated in the middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, bringing a blue fabric banner with white text into clearer view on the right side, hanging near the center-right of the frame. This banner is positioned in the foreground, accompanied by a digital display board showing images, suggesting a restaurant entrance. To the left, decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding greenery and warmth to the scene. An escalator is visible further back on the left side, enhancing the modern feel of the space. The camera's movement is smooth, maintaining a steady pace as it transitions from the initial wide view of the walkway to a closer focus on the banner and display board. The watermark \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV\" remains consistently in the lower left corner,",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is an urban scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of the indoor space, highlighting architectural elements and ambient lighting rather than a specific object or subject. The composition emphasizes the overall setting and mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a first-person POV, takes place in an indoor setting resembling a modern shopping or dining area. The environment features a long, covered walkway with a sleek, contemporary design. The ceiling is lined with exposed beams, and the floor is smooth and clean. On one side, large windows or glass walls reveal brightly lit interiors that appear to be restaurants, as indicated by an illuminated advertising stand near the entrance. Decorative elements like potted plants and wooden benches are placed along the walkway, adding a touch of greenery and warmth. An escalator is visible in the scene, enhancing the modern feel of the area. Notable visual elements include a blue fabric banner with white text and a digital display board showing images, suggesting a restaurant entrance. Overlay elements, such as a watermark reading \"VIRTUAL JAPAN.TV,\" are present in the lower corner, indicating the video’s source.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions:\n\nThe caption is good but has several significant flaws that violate the core instructions. While it successfully describes the spatial layout and camera movement, it fails on key negative constraints regarding speculative and subjective language.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of the physical space. It correctly identifies the shot as a wide shot, the camera height as eye level, and the camera movement as a smooth forward push. The 2D and 3D positioning of key elements like the walkway (background), windows (right, middle ground), and the blue banner (center-right, foreground) is precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Strengths:** The description is very thorough, covering the initial static view and the dynamic change as the camera moves. It includes details from all parts of the frame (top, bottom, left, right) and at different depths (foreground, middle ground, background), including the watermark.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The caption ends with a comma, making it an incomplete sentence and a grammatical error.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption follows the structural requirements well. It starts with the shot size, describes the spatial positions of multiple elements using both 2D and 3D terms, notes the camera height, and clearly explains the camera's movement and how it changes the framing.\n*   **Weaknesses (Major Violations):**\n    *   **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" The caption violates this rule with phrases like \"**likely** shops or restaurants\" and \"**suggesting** a restaurant entrance.\" It should only describe what is visibly certain.\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this with words and phrases like \"**sleek, contemporary** design,\" \"adding greenery and **warmth**,\" and \"enhancing the **modern feel**.\" These are interpretations of the scene's mood and style, not objective spatial descriptions.\n\nIn summary, the caption excels at describing the spatial composition and camera dynamics but fails to adhere to the critical negative constraints of avoiding subjective and speculative language. To be considered \"good\" under the given rules, these interpretive phrases must be removed and the final sentence must be grammatically complete.",
