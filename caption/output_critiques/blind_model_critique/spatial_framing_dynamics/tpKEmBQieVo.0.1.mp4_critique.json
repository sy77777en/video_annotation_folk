    "pre_caption": "This video begins with a full shot of a person in a wingsuit positioned in the center-middle ground, with a large rock formation to the left in the middle ground and distant mountains in the right background. The person walks a few steps away from the camera, causing the framing to shift to a wide shot. They then stop in the center-middle ground and spread their arms, fully extending the wingsuit. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with long blonde hair tied back is shown from behind, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and a bright yellow and blue wingsuit. They wear a black backpack with blue and white stripes and yellow and black hiking boots. The person walks a few steps forward on the rocky ground, then stops and spreads their arms wide, fully extending the wings of the suit.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A person in a yellow wingsuit with a black backpack featuring blue and white stripes stands on a wide, rocky mountain plateau under a sky filled with heavy grey clouds. The ground is covered in loose, light-colored stones. To the left, a large, layered rock formation has patches of snow near its base. In the distance to the right, a break in the clouds reveals other sharp mountain peaks. The person walks a few steps away from the camera before stopping and spreading their arms, unfurling the fabric of the wingsuit.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and key environmental elements, but it contains a spatial contradiction and could be more precise. The statement that the person starts in the \"center-middle ground,\" walks away, and then stops in the \"center-middle ground\" is inconsistent; moving away from the camera would shift their position further into the scene, perhaps from the near-middle ground to the far-middle ground, closer to the background. The description also omits any foreground elements, such as the rocky ground or cliff edge the person is standing on, which would provide a more complete sense of depth. Furthermore, the description of the rock formation and mountains is vague; specifying that the rock formation occupies the entire left side of the frame or that the mountains form a continuous line across the background would improve compositional clarity. Finally, the description of the action ends abruptly. If the person jumps after spreading their arms, this critical spatial transition—moving from the center of the frame and rapidly descending out of view—is a major omission.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a full shot of a person in a wingsuit standing on a rocky ground or cliff edge in the near-middle ground, with a large rock formation dominating the entire left side of the frame and a continuous line of distant mountains in the background. The person walks a few steps away from the camera, shifting their position from the near-middle ground to the far-middle ground, closer to the background. They stop and spread their arms, fully extending the wingsuit. The camera remains at the subject's level. After this, the person jumps, creating a dynamic transition as they move from the center of the frame and rapidly descend out of view.",
