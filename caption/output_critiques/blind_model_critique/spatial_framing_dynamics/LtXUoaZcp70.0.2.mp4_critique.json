    "pre_caption": "A full shot displays a scene set against a dark background with a faint grid on the floor. In the center of the frame and the middle ground, a translucent blue figure of a man stands behind a brown wooden table. A glowing red-orange box rests on the table, also in the center middle ground. In the bottom left foreground, the text \"Georg Elser\" is overlaid on the screen. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A translucent, blue, 3D representation of a man stands behind a simple, brown, four-legged wooden table. The man is wearing what appears to be a collared shirt and trousers, with his hands in his trousers' pockets. On the table sits a rectangular box that emits a bright, fiery red-orange glow. In the lower-left corner, the name \"Georg Elser\" is displayed in a white, typewriter-style font.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, undefined space with a faint grid pattern on the floor, a simple wooden table is positioned in the center. A translucent, blue, human-like figure stands behind the table. On the tabletop, a rectangular object emits a bright red glow. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the name \"Georg Elser\" in a white, typewriter-style font, and the text changes from \"[2,3,4]\" to \"[5,6].\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the camera movement and its effect on the subjects' spatial relationship is confusing and likely inaccurate. Stating the table shifts to the foreground while the figure *behind* it remains in the middle ground is spatially improbable unless it's a complex visual effect like parallax with layered digital elements, which is not explained. A more plausible scenario is that a forward dolly movement would cause both the table and the figure to move towards the foreground, transitioning the shot from a full shot to a medium shot or medium close-up; this change in shot size is a critical omission. Furthermore, the caption fails to specify the position of the \"glowing red-orange box\" on the table (e.g., center, left, right) and how its framing changes during the camera move, even though its glow suggests it's a focal point. The description of the overlay text \"Georg Elser\" and the changing numbers lacks any spatial positioning (e.g., bottom left, top center), making it difficult to visualize their placement within the composition. Finally, describing the figure simply as \"stands\" is too static; a detail about its posture or orientation relative to the camera (e.g., facing forward, in profile) would provide more complete spatial information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene is set against a dark background with a faint grid on the floor. The camera moves forward, transitioning the shot from a full shot to a medium shot, bringing both the translucent blue figure of a man and the brown wooden table towards the foreground. The man stands behind the table, facing forward. A glowing red-orange box, positioned centrally on the table, serves as a focal point. The text \"Georg Elser\" is overlaid in the bottom left corner of the screen. The camera's movement enhances the spatial relationship between the elements, emphasizing the box's glow and the figure's presence.",
