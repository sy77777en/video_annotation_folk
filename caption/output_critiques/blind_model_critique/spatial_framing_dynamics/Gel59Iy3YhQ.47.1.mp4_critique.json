    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, captured from a side-view perspective at the subject's height, initially frames a small, white character in the center-right of the scene, positioned in the middle ground on a raised platform next to a bench. In the foreground, large, sinuous black shapes occupy the left and top of the frame, with spiky ground along the bottom. A user interface is visible in the top-left corner. The character then leaps from the platform towards the left, moving to the center of the frame. While airborne in the middle ground, the character emits a large, bright white flash of light that radiates outward from its central position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, white, insect-like character with a horned, mask-like head and two large, black, empty eye sockets stands in a dark, monochromatic environment. The character, clad in a dark, tattered cloak, is positioned on a spiky, dark-colored ledge next to a simple bench. In the upper-left corner, a display shows a row of nine white, mask-like icons and the number 2722 next to a white, flower-shaped symbol. The character is also seen emitting a large, bright white flash of light that radiates outward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, monochromatic, cavernous environment. The landscape is defined by sharp, spiky ground and long, dark tendrils hanging from above, with large, sinuous, black shapes dominating the foreground and a blurry, indistinct background. On a raised platform, a dark, ornate bench sits next to glowing purple crystals. A small, white character is seen standing beside the bench before leaping into the air and executing an attack that produces a large, bright white flash of light. An overlay is present in the top-left corner, displaying a row of mask icons, a flower-shaped symbol, and the number 2722.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The description accurately captures the initial framing and the character's basic action, but it misses key spatial dynamics that would be present in the video. The caption states the character \"moves to the center of the frame,\" which implies a static camera; however, it's more likely the camera pans slightly to the left to follow the character's leap, keeping them as the central focus during the movement. The description of the scene's depth is incomplete, as it details the foreground and middle ground but entirely omits any background elements, such as a distant cavern wall or faint structures that would provide a complete sense of the 3D space. Furthermore, while the \"flash of light\" is mentioned, its spatial effect is not described. The flash would likely illuminate the entire scene, momentarily revealing the texture of the foreground shapes and casting shadows, which is a significant change in the spatial lighting. Finally, the relationship between the platform and the bench is described as \"next to,\" but it could be more precise by stating if the bench is on the same plane or slightly behind the platform in the middle ground, which would better define the depth of that layer.",
