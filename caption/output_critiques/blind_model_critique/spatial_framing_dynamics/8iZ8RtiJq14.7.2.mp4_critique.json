    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a red thumbtack in the foreground, positioned in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame. A red string extends from the thumbtack toward the right, leading to out-of-focus papers and another thumbtack in the middle ground and background. The camera's focus then shifts, moving along the red string as it travels from the bottom left toward the center of the frame. The shot transitions to a close-up of the red string, now in the middle ground, as it lies across a yellow piece of paper in the bottom-center of the frame. The initial thumbtack is now a blurred element in the background on the left, with another out-of-focus thumbtack visible in the background on the right. The camera remains at a low angle, level with the surface, for the entire duration.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A translucent red thumbtack with a round head is pushed through a small white piece of paper into a light brown, marbled surface. A twisted red string is wrapped around the base of the thumbtack's head. The camera's focus shifts, moving along the red string as it stretches across the surface, leading towards other thumbtacks and small pieces of paper. One piece of paper is yellow and clearly displays the text \"$2k for $10k.\"**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The camera moves across a surface resembling a marbled tabletop or a corkboard. Several red, translucent thumbtacks are pushed into small pieces of white and yellow paper. A thin, twisted red string connects the thumbtacks, creating a network across the board. The camera's focus shifts, following the path of the red string from one pinned note to another, leaving the surrounding elements blurred.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a full shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the camera's general movement, but it could be more precise in its terminology and description of the visual dynamics. The term \"full view\" is ambiguous; given the small size of a thumbtack, the shot is likely an \"extreme close-up,\" which should be specified. The description of the focus change could be more dynamic; instead of just \"focus shifts,\" it would be more descriptive to state that the focus \"racks\" or \"pulls\" along the string, which is a key visual action. Furthermore, the caption states the second thumbtack \"comes into view,\" which is likely inaccurate. It was probably visible from the start, but out of focus in the middle ground or background on the right side of the frame. Mentioning its initial blurry state would better describe the change in depth and focus. Finally, describing the camera's movement directly (e.g., \"the camera pans/slides to the right\") would be clearer than describing the effect of that movement (the first thumbtack exiting the frame).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with an extreme close-up of a red thumbtack in the bottom-left quadrant of the frame. A red string extends from this thumbtack toward the right, leading to out-of-focus papers and another thumbtack in the middle ground and background. The camera's focus dynamically racks along the red string as it travels from the bottom left toward the center of the frame. The shot transitions to a close-up of the red string, now in the middle ground, lying across a yellow piece of paper in the bottom-center of the frame. The initial thumbtack becomes a blurred element in the background on the left, while another out-of-focus thumbtack is visible in the background on the right. The camera maintains a low angle, level with the surface, and slides to the right throughout the scene.",
