    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot primarily features several pairs of legs and feet dangling in the middle ground, positioned across the upper half of the frame (top left, top center, top right). Below them, a textured metallic platform occupies the bottom portion of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the middle ground. A large, blurry vertical element is prominent in the right foreground, partially obscuring the view. The legs show slight movement, suggesting the motion of a ride. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking up from the platform towards the feet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of people seated on a swing ride. The focus is on their legs and feet, which are visible as they dangle above a metallic platform. The individuals are wearing a variety of footwear, including sandals and closed shoes, and some are dressed in patterned pants. The scene captures the motion of the ride, with legs slightly elevated and swinging. The overall composition highlights the diversity in clothing and footwear among the riders.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a low-angle view from a textured, metallic floor, characteristic of an amusement park ride platform. Several pairs of legs dangle just above this surface, belonging to unseen riders seated above. The footwear varies, including dark sneakers, dark wedge boots worn with patterned leggings, and sandals. The background is indistinct, hinting at a bustling fairground environment. The legs hang suspended, suggesting the motion of a ride.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good, but it has one minor flaw. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the main visual components: the dangling legs and feet, the textured metallic platform, and the blurry vertical element. The description of their appearance (dangling, textured, blurry) and placement is precise and matches the video content perfectly.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"close-up shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It does an excellent job of describing both the 2D position (upper half, bottom portion, right) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground) for each key element.\n*   **Camera Height:** It accurately states that the camera is at a \"low angle, looking up.\"\n*   **Movement:** It correctly notes the \"slight movement\" of the legs.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to most of the stylistic and content rules, but it violates one specific negative constraint.\n*   **Strengths:** It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids emotional adjectives and focuses on objective, spatial description.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The phrase \"**suggesting the motion of a ride**\" violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" While the inference is logical, the instruction requires describing only what is visibly happening, not interpreting the cause. The movement itself is the observable fact; the \"ride\" is a speculation. A more compliant alternative would be to describe the movement itself, for example, \"The legs sway slightly back and forth.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, detail, and structure. It provides a clear and comprehensive spatial analysis of the scene. Its only flaw is a minor violation of the rule against speculation. By revising that single phrase, the caption would be perfect.",
