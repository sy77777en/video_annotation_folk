    "pre_caption": "This medium shot initially frames three women from the thighs up in the center-right foreground on a wet, sandy beach. The foreground and middle ground are composed of the shoreline, with other people scattered in the water and on the sand to the left. In the background, trees and beachside structures are visible on the right, while the setting sun is positioned slightly left of center. The camera then pans slightly to the right, shifting the group of women to the center of the frame. This movement causes the sun to become obscured behind the head of the woman on the right, who holds an object and leans forward, becoming the most prominent figure in the group. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **Three women stand close together on a wet, sandy beach, their bodies visible from the thighs up. The woman on the left has light skin and long, dark hair. She wears a white, long-sleeved cover-up open over a pink bikini top and patterned bottoms, and she stands with one hand on her hip at first. In the center, a woman with a medium skin tone wears a wide-brimmed hat and a green t-shirt with sunglasses hanging from the collar. She holds a black object, possibly a phone, and looks down at it. To her left, a woman with dark skin and long, dark hair, dressed in a sleeveless, lime-green top, leans in to look at the object as well.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a wide, sandy beach during sunset, with the bright sun low on the horizon creating a strong glare over the water. The wet sand at the water's edge reflects the golden light. In the foreground, three young women stand together in the shallow surf. The background and middleground feature a line of trees, simple beachside structures, and other people scattered along the shore and in the water. The camera's perspective shifts.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The shot captures four people from their upper bodies to their thighs, standing close together on the beach. The wide framing also reveals the scenic surroundings—golden sand, gentle waves, trees, and beachside structures—with the sun setting in the background.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the camera's arcing movement and the general composition, it could be more specific about the spatial relationships within the central group and the dynamics of the background. The description of the \"group of women\" is too general; it would be more informative to detail their arrangement, for instance, if two women stand slightly behind a central one, creating a triangular formation that adds depth. The caption also implies the women are static, but it's more likely they are subtly turning or shifting their weight to remain oriented towards the moving camera, a key detail of their spatial dynamic. Furthermore, the description of the background elements like \"trees and beachside structures\" is vague; it should specify their initial position (e.g., on the right side of the frame) and how they shift across the background as the camera pans. Finally, while the caption mentions \"other people,\" it misses an opportunity to clarify the depth of field by noting if these secondary figures are blurred and out of focus, which would emphasize the sharp focus on the main subjects in the foreground.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The medium shot begins by framing three women from the thighs up in the center-right foreground on a wet, sandy beach. The women are arranged in a triangular formation, with two slightly behind the central figure, adding depth to the composition. The shoreline occupies the foreground and middle ground, with other people scattered in the water and on the sand to the left, appearing blurred and out of focus, which emphasizes the sharp focus on the main subjects. In the background, trees and beachside structures are initially visible on the right side of the frame. As the camera pans slightly to the right, the group of women shifts to the center, and the sun becomes obscured behind the head of the woman on the right, who holds an object and leans forward, becoming the most prominent figure. The women subtly turn or shift their weight to remain oriented towards the moving camera, maintaining their spatial dynamic. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot, while the background elements shift across the frame, enhancing the scene's depth and movement.",
