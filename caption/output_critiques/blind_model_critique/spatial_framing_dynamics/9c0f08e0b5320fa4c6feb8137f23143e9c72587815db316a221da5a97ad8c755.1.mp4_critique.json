    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young man centered in the frame, playing an electronic keyboard located in the bottom foreground against a textured wall in the background. The camera then slowly pulls back, smoothly transitioning to a wider shot that reveals the man from the knees up, seated on a wooden stool. Throughout this movement, the man remains centrally positioned as more of the keyboard and his lower body come into view. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young Black man with short, black, twisted hair is seated and playing a black electronic keyboard. He is wearing a short-sleeved, dark blue button-up shirt over a grey t-shirt, paired with light brown pants. On his right wrist, he wears a black beaded bracelet. His focus alternates between looking at a sheet of paper positioned above the piano and looking down at his hands as they move across the piano keys.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors against a large, textured wall with a mottled, light-grey and beige finish that resembles concrete or plaster. In the middle ground, a young man is seated on a simple wooden stool, playing a black electronic keyboard. The environment is evenly lit, creating a neutral and minimalist setting. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly pulls back, gradually widening the view to include more of the keyboard and the simple surroundings.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively describes the camera movement and the transition from a medium to a full shot, it could be more precise about the spatial relationships at the start. Describing the man as being in the \"middle ground\" feels inaccurate; if the keyboard is in the foreground, the man playing it is likely also in the foreground, just positioned directly behind it. The caption could also benefit from specifying the man's orientation, such as whether he is in profile or at a three-quarter angle to the camera, which is a key aspect of his spatial presence. Furthermore, the wooden stool is introduced only after the camera pulls back, but it's plausible that the top of it was visible in the initial medium shot. Clarifying that the pull-back *fully reveals* the stool would be more accurate. Lastly, while the textured wall is mentioned, explicitly placing it in the background and perhaps noting another static element, like a small lamp on the right side of the frame, would provide a more complete and grounded description of the scene's depth and composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a young man in the foreground, playing an electronic keyboard positioned directly in front of him against a textured wall in the background. The man is oriented at a three-quarter angle to the camera. The camera then slowly pulls back, smoothly transitioning to a wider shot that fully reveals the man from the knees up, seated on a wooden stool, which was partially visible in the initial shot. Throughout this movement, the man remains centrally positioned as more of the keyboard and his lower body come into view. A small lamp is visible on the right side of the frame, adding depth to the scene's composition.",
