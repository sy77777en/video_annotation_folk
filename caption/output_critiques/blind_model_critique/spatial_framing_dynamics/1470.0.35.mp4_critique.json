    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot capturing multiple subjects in a domestic setting. Initially, a woman with short blonde hair, dressed in a blue and white checkered dress, is positioned in the foreground on the right side of the frame. She moves slightly towards the center. As the video progresses, a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress enters from the left, partially turning away and moving into the middle ground. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants then appears in the foreground on the left, engaging with the other subjects. A child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat joins near the center, interacting with the adults. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout. In the background, a yellow door opens, revealing another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, standing further back in the scene. The large, cream-colored refrigerator occupies the right side of the frame in the foreground, while a wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left in the middle ground. The vase with blue and yellow flowers sits on a countertop in the background, near the center-right. The camera maintains a consistent perspective, focusing on the interactions among the group without significant changes in shot size or position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress. A woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress appears partially turned away. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants is seen next, followed by a child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat. Finally, a door is opened, revealing another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants. The scene suggests an interaction among the group in a domestic setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set in a bright, vintage-style dining area with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room features a yellow door that is opened, revealing another room with a window and curtains, adding a retro touch. A large, cream-colored refrigerator stands prominently on the right, with a smooth, glossy surface. A wooden dining table with chairs is visible on the left, contributing to the cozy, domestic setting. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light filtering through a window, softly illuminating the space. A vase with blue and yellow flowers adds a pop of color on a countertop. The scene captures a moment of activity, with several people interacting, enhancing the lively, familial ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption correctly starts by identifying the shot size as a \"medium shot,\" fulfilling the first requirement.\n*   **Spatial Positioning (2D and 3D):** The description is exceptionally thorough in detailing the spatial positions of multiple subjects and key objects. It successfully uses both 2D terms (right, left, center) and 3D terms (foreground, middle ground, background) for each element mentioned (e.g., \"woman... in the foreground on the right,\" \"table... on the left in the middle ground,\" \"person... in the background\").\n*   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states the camera's height relative to the subjects (\"at the subjects' level\"), as instructed.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics and Movement:** The caption excels at describing movement and changes within the frame. It clearly outlines how subjects enter the scene (\"enters from the left,\" \"appears in the foreground\"), move within it (\"moves slightly towards the center\"), and how background elements change (\"a yellow door opens, revealing another person\").\n\n**2. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption balances detail with clarity. While it is dense with information, every piece of information directly addresses the prompt's focus on spatial framing.\n*   **Objective Language:** It strictly uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"appears,\" \"might be\"). The descriptions are factual and observational (\"mustard yellow sweater,\" \"cream-colored refrigerator\").\n*   **Structure and Format:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, perfectly matching the formatting requirements. The flow is logical, establishing the initial scene and then describing the sequence of actions.\n*   **Focus:** The entire caption is dedicated to describing the spatial relationships and dynamics, successfully ignoring narrative, character emotions, or any details not visually present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and strictly adheres to all stylistic and content-related rules. It demonstrates a clear understanding of concepts like shot size, depth of field, and spatial movement, translating them into a clear and objective description. No significant improvements are needed.",
