    "pre_caption": "The video captures a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court enclosed by a chain-link fence. The camera remains stationary throughout, offering a consistent view of the scene. The basketball court occupies the center of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. The fence forms the immediate foreground, with its gate slightly ajar, positioned centrally along the bottom edge of the frame. Bare trees line the background, stretching across the top left and top right sections of the frame, while tall buildings appear further back in the distance, situated towards the upper middle part of the scene. Puddles on the court surface are scattered across the middle ground, reflecting the overcast sky above. The camera's height is level with the fence, providing a direct view of the court and surrounding elements without any noticeable elevation or angle change. There are no significant shifts in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the video, maintaining a steady perspective on the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the open space and natural elements like trees and the overcast sky. The absence of a specific main subject emphasizes the mood and setting rather than any particular object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents a first-person POV shot of an outdoor basketball court surrounded by a chain-link fence. The setting is a park-like area with bare trees, suggesting late autumn or winter. The court is wet, indicating recent rain, and puddles are visible on the ground. In the background, there are tall buildings, hinting at an urban environment. The sky is overcast, contributing to a muted, gray atmosphere. The scene is devoid of people, emphasizing the stillness and quiet of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"wide shot\" and accurately pinpoints the spatial relationships of all key elements. The descriptions of the basketball court (center, foreground to middle ground), the fence and gate (immediate foreground, bottom center), the trees (background, top left/right), and the buildings (distant background, upper middle) are precise. The observation that the camera is stationary and level with the fence is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very thorough and fulfills all the requirements of the instructions.\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly begins by specifying the \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It successfully describes both the 2D position (e.g., \"center,\" \"top left\") and the 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for multiple elements in the scene.\n*   **Camera Height:** It clearly states the camera's height is \"level with the fence.\"\n*   **Dynamics:** It explicitly notes the lack of movement by stating the \"camera remains stationary\" and there are \"no significant shifts.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   It avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and sticks to what is visibly certain.\n*   It focuses entirely on spatial framing and dynamics as requested, without adding extraneous information.\n*   It successfully structures the information logically, starting with the overall shot and then detailing the placement of individual elements.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model response that is accurate, complete, and strictly adheres to all aspects of the provided instructions. It effectively translates the visual composition of the video into a concise and informative textual description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a wide shot of an outdoor basketball court surrounded by a chain-link fence. The camera remains fixed, providing a consistent view of the scene. The basketball court is centrally positioned, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. The fence, with its gate slightly open, forms the immediate foreground at the bottom center of the frame. Bare trees line the background, stretching across the top left and right, while tall buildings are visible in the distant background, towards the upper middle. Puddles scattered across the court reflect the overcast sky. The camera is level with the fence, offering a direct view of the court and its surroundings without any change in elevation or angle. The shot maintains a steady perspective throughout, with no significant shifts in size or spatial positioning.",
