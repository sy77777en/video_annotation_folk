    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man's face is initially seen in profile on the right side of the frame, looking toward the left. The scene is extremely dark, with a single light source illuminating the right side of his face, leaving the rest of his features and the background in shadow. The camera performs a slow, clockwise arc around him. This movement gradually brings more of his face into view, revealing his wide eyes as he shifts from a profile to a three-quarter view, positioned in the center-right of the frame. The camera remains at his eye level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin is shown in a dimly lit environment. He has short, dark hair or is bald, and he has a dark mustache and a short beard. Initially seen in profile, the camera moves in a clockwise arc around him, revealing wide eyes and a slightly open mouth. He is wearing a light-colored t-shirt. The lighting illuminates only one side of his face, leaving the other in deep shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a nearly pitch-black environment, a man's face is partially illuminated by a single, dim light source from the side, creating deep shadows that obscure the background entirely. His skin has a noticeable sheen, and the camera moves in a clockwise arc around him, gradually revealing his wide eyes. The setting is undefined, consisting only of the enveloping darkness around him.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the shot as a close-up and notes the camera's eye-level height, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The description of the man's movement as shifting to the \"center-right of the frame\" is potentially misleading; in the video, the man's head remains anchored on the right side, simply rotating in place rather than moving horizontally across the frame. The caption should clarify this is a rotational movement. Furthermore, while the lighting is well-described, the caption omits the subject's depth, failing to state that his face occupies the foreground against a completely black background. The phrase \"more of his face comes into view\" is vague; specifying that he \"slowly rotates his head toward the camera\" would be more descriptive of the action. Finally, describing his eyes as \"wide\" borders on interpretation; a more objective description, such as \"his fully open eyes are revealed,\" would better adhere to the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives.",
