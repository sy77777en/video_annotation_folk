    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a man in a uniform is initially positioned slightly right of center in the middle ground. Behind him, striped curtains occupy the background across the top half of the frame, with a hanging light fixture in the top center middle ground. A green light source is visible in the left foreground, and a red neon light element is seen in the right middle ground/background. The man turns slightly to his left, moving towards the center-left of the frame while staying in the middle ground. The camera remains level with the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man wearing a white uniform with short sleeves and a matching white cap with a red stripe. He has a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and is wearing glasses. The man is positioned in a dimly lit setting, and his facial hair is neatly trimmed. In the video, he is seen raising his arm and flexing his bicep, appearing to dance very relaxedly. The lighting casts a warm glow, highlighting his profile and the details of his attire.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit ambiance, likely during the evening. The environment features a room with striped curtains and a hanging light fixture that casts a soft glow. The walls and decor suggest a retro or vintage style, with muted colors and a cozy atmosphere. A person is present, wearing a white uniform and a hat, adding to the nostalgic feel of the scene. The lighting creates a mix of shadows and highlights, enhancing the intimate and slightly mysterious mood of the space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the shot as a **close-up**.\n*   It accurately describes the man's initial position as **slightly right of center** in the **middle ground**.\n*   The descriptions of the background elements are correct: **striped curtains** in the **background**, a **hanging light fixture** in the **top center middle ground**, a **green light source** in the **left foreground**, and a **red neon light** on the right.\n*   The description of the man's movement—turning to his left and moving toward the **center-left** of the frame—is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete and successfully addresses all the requirements of the prompt.\n*   It specifies the **shot size**.\n*   It details the **2D position** (left, right, center) and **3D position** (foreground, middle ground, background) for the main subject and multiple other elements.\n*   It describes the **spatial movement** of the subject.\n*   It correctly notes the **camera's height** is level with the subject.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres well to the given constraints.\n*   It is a **single, concise paragraph** written in simple, natural English.\n*   It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   The only minor deviation is the use of \"middle ground/background\" for the red light, which could be seen as violating the \"avoid ambiguous options like 'A or B'\" rule. However, given the element's position, this description accurately reflects a slight visual ambiguity in depth. A more decisive choice like \"right background\" would also have been acceptable and more strictly compliant.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is excellent. It is a well-structured, accurate, and comprehensive description of the video's spatial framing and dynamics, fulfilling all the key requirements of the instructions with only one very minor, justifiable deviation.",
