    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot where a red Land Rover occupies the left half of the frame in the foreground. In the middle ground, a black Mercedes is positioned in the center-right, with other cars parked behind it. The camera, positioned at the vehicle's level, then moves backward and to the right, parallel to the Land Rover. This movement causes the shot to transition into a full shot, revealing the entire rear of the Land Rover, which now fills the center-left of the frame. As the camera continues its path, the Land Rover remains the primary foreground subject, while the background buildings on the right become more fully visible across the top of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A red Land Rover Defender 90 with a white roof is shown on a street. The vehicle features a black roof rack, a black mesh grille over the rear side window, and black fender flares. A spare off-road tire on a white steel wheel is mounted on the rear door, next to a black access ladder. The vehicle has a yellow UK license plate reading \"R614 JGF,\" with the word \"Pooh\" written in white next to it and a small Union Jack flag sticker on the bottom right corner of the rear side of the car. Parked behind the Land Rover across the street is a black Mercedes-Benz B-Class station wagon with silver multi-spoke wheels. Behind the Mercedes is a silver sedan with a blue and white graphic on its rear side door. A white sedan is visible parked further down the street.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves along an urban street during the daytime. The camera walks alongside a red off-road vehicle with a white roof, a roof rack, a rear-mounted ladder, and a large spare tire. The vehicle remains in the frame the entire time, parked on the side of an asphalt road with white painted lines. Along the street, other cars, including a black Mercedes-Benz, are parked in front of tall, light-colored stone buildings with large windows. An overlay in the bottom right corner displays the text \"The Stradman\" in red and white.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions, providing a description that is accurate, complete, and stylistically correct. It successfully translates the visual information of the video into a concise, objective, and spatially-aware paragraph.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the subjects (red Land Rover, black Mercedes, other cars, buildings) and their key attributes.\n*   It correctly describes the spatial relationships: the Land Rover is in the foreground on the left, the Mercedes is in the middle ground to the center-right, and buildings are in the background.\n*   The description of the camera movement (\"backward and to the right, parallel to the Land Rover\") is precise and accurately captures the dynamic nature of the shot.\n*   The resulting change in framing—from a medium shot to a full shot, and the Land Rover's shift to the center-left—is described correctly.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** The caption correctly identifies the initial \"medium shot\" and its transition to a \"full shot.\"\n*   **2D Position:** It effectively uses terms like \"left half,\" \"center-right,\" and \"center-left\" to place elements within the frame.\n*   **3D Depth:** It clearly distinguishes between \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" and \"background\" elements.\n*   **Camera Height:** It correctly notes the camera is \"positioned at the vehicle's level.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** The caption excels at describing the movement. It doesn't just state that the camera moves; it explains the direction of movement and, crucially, the *effect* of that movement on the framing of both the primary subject and the background.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is dense with information without being wordy. Every phrase contributes to the spatial description.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful car,\" \"impressive building\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"it might be\"), as instructed.\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the initial state, through the camera movement, to the final state.\n*   **Focus:** The focus remains squarely on spatial framing and dynamics, exactly as the prompt demanded.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, well-structured, and written in clear, natural English. There are no flaws or areas for improvement.",
