    "pre_caption": "A full shot, filmed from above, shows a corroded artifact positioned in the center of the frame, resting in the foreground on a dark surface. A black line then appears, running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right across the center of the artifact. The artifact subsequently splits into two pieces along this line, with both halves remaining in their original central position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A corroded, ancient-looking artifact is shown against a dark surface. The object is roughly square-shaped with irregular, broken edges. Its surface is heavily textured with a greenish patina, characteristic of oxidized copper or bronze, and patches of reddish-brown rust. Despite the corrosion, raised patterns are visible, including a central circular design that contains what appears to be a stylized face or symbol. During the video, a clean, black line appears diagonally across the artifact, and it splits into two distinct pieces along this line, suggesting it has broken.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An ancient, corroded metal artifact rests on a dark brown wooden surface. The object is roughly square with irregular edges and is covered in a thick, uneven patina of green and reddish-brown. A faint, embossed circular design is visible on its surface. The artifact splits cleanly into two distinct pieces along a line that runs diagonally across it.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and sequence, but its spatial description could be more precise and accurate. The term \"full shot\" is ambiguous for an object of this kind; a \"medium shot\" might be more appropriate if the artifact fills a significant portion of the frame with some surrounding space. For a direct top-down perspective, describing the artifact as being in the \"foreground\" is less effective than simply stating it rests on the surface, as the sense of depth is flattened into a single plane. The description of the split is the most problematic; stating that the halves \"remain in their original central position\" is a logical contradiction. A more accurate description would be that the two halves separate by moving a short distance away from each other along the diagonal line, creating a visible gap, while their combined mass remains generally centered in the frame. Finally, the caption could clarify the nature of the line and the split, for instance, by specifying if they are animated digital effects superimposed on the artifact rather than a physical occurrence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot, filmed from a top-down perspective, shows a corroded artifact positioned centrally on a dark surface. A black line appears, running diagonally from the top left to the bottom right across the center of the artifact. The artifact then splits into two pieces along this line, with the halves moving slightly apart to create a visible gap, while their combined mass remains generally centered in the frame. The line and split appear to be animated digital effects superimposed on the artifact.",
