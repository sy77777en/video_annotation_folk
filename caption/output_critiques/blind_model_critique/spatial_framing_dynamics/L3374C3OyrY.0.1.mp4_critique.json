    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a close-up shot featuring a red soccer cleat in the bottom left foreground and the right portion of a yellow soccer ball in the right middle ground. The camera then rotates slightly to the left while pulling back, transitioning into a medium close-up that reveals the complete arrangement. In the final frame, the first cleat is fully visible in the bottom left foreground, a second cleat is seen lying on its side in the center middle ground, and the entire soccer ball occupies the right middle ground. The subjects are situated on a green, grassy surface at the bottom of the frame, with the camera positioned at their level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A pair of bright red Nike soccer cleats and a yellow Nike soccer ball rest on a green, grassy surface. The soccer ball, positioned on the right, is yellow with large black graphic patterns. It features a black Nike swoosh, the word \"STRIKE,\" and the number \"90\" enclosed within a circle. The cleats are a vibrant red with a textured, honeycomb-like pattern and a prominent white Nike swoosh on the outer side. One cleat is upright in the foreground, with its white-tipped studs visible, while the other cleat lies on its side, partially obscured behind the first cleat and the ball. Both the ball and the cleats are covered in water droplets.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A pair of wet, red soccer cleats and a yellow soccer ball rest on a green, grassy field at night. Rain falls steadily, coating the textured surface of the cleats and the panels of the ball with water droplets. The cleats feature a white Nike swoosh, and one is positioned upright while the other lies on its side, revealing its white-tipped studs. The yellow ball, also branded with a black Nike swoosh and the number \"90,\" sits next to the cleats. The scene is illuminated by a bright, overhead light against a dark background.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The scene consists of a pair of shoes and a ball. The initial shot focuses on one shoe and half of the ball. After that, the camera rotates and pulls back to reveal the full scene.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all key subjects (two red cleats, one yellow soccer ball), their initial and final states (partial vs. full visibility), and their specific placement on a green surface. The description of the camera movement—a rotation to the left combined with a pullback—is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial \"close-up\" and the final \"medium close-up,\" clearly describing the transition.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It excels here by providing both the 2D position (bottom left, right, center) and the 3D depth (foreground, middle ground) for every subject in both the initial and final frames.\n    *   **Dynamics and Changes:** The caption effectively describes the spatial dynamics, explaining how the camera movement \"reveals the complete arrangement,\" including the appearance of the second cleat and the full view of the ball.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly includes the camera's height relative to the subjects (\"positioned at their level\").\n    *   **Style and Tone:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and focuses entirely on the visual, spatial facts as instructed. It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of the instructions provided. It successfully synthesizes all the required elements—shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and movement—into a concise, clear, and comprehensive description of the video's spatial framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up shot showing a red soccer cleat in the bottom left foreground and part of a yellow soccer ball in the right middle ground. The camera then slightly rotates to the left and pulls back, transitioning into a medium close-up that reveals the full scene. In the final frame, the first cleat is fully visible in the bottom left foreground, a second cleat is lying on its side in the center middle ground, and the entire soccer ball is in the right middle ground. All subjects are on a green, grassy surface at the bottom of the frame, with the camera positioned at their level.",
