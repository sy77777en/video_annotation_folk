    "pre_caption": "A man is shown in a medium close-up shot, positioned slightly left of center in the foreground. To his right, a weathered green wooden post stands in the middle ground. The background is composed of a wooden interior, with a window in the top right quadrant revealing a green, wooded area outside. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged man with dark skin is shown from the chest up. He has a very short, buzzed haircut and a neatly trimmed goatee. He is wearing a plain, muted reddish-brown, short-sleeved t-shirt. He is seated and looking slightly to his left with a serious expression on his face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set during the day within a rustic, wood-paneled interior, possibly an enclosed porch or cabin. The walls are constructed from vertical wooden planks, with some sections and a prominent post painted in a weathered, light green finish. A window in the background provides a view of a bright, green, and wooded outdoor area. A man in a brown t-shirt is seated in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the shot size and the main elements in the foreground, middle ground, and background. However, it describes the scene as completely static, failing to mention that the man, initially looking forward, slowly turns his head to the right toward the post, a key spatial dynamic. The description of the post as simply \"to his right\" is also imprecise; the post is positioned more centrally in the frame, creating a strong vertical compositional line. A crucial detail omitted is the shallow depth of field, which keeps the man in sharp focus while the wooden interior and the view from the window in the background are softly blurred, a technique that significantly enhances the sense of depth and isolates the subject. Additionally, the caption neglects to mention the effect of the light coming from the window, which illuminates the right side of the man's face and the post, helping to define their forms and separate them from the darker background.",
