    "pre_caption": "The video is a wide shot capturing a quiet, rain-soaked urban street from a slightly elevated perspective. The scene begins with a view from the top of a descending staircase, positioned centrally in the frame, leading down to a wet road. The road runs vertically through the center, flanked by lush green trees on both sides, positioned in the middle ground. Modest residential buildings are visible on the right and left, also in the middle ground. Power lines crisscross the top of the frame, adding to the urban atmosphere, and are situated in the background. The camera is positioned at a height above the street level, looking slightly downward, emphasizing the gentle slope of the road. As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, maintaining the central alignment of the road and trees, enhancing the sense of depth and tranquility in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a quiet, rain-soaked urban street. The scene features a gently sloping road flanked by lush green trees and modest residential buildings, with wet pavement reflecting the overcast sky. Power lines crisscross above, adding to the urban atmosphere. The focus is on the serene environment and the interplay of rain and greenery, rather than any specific object, creating a tranquil and atmospheric mood.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video offers a first-person POV shot, simulating the character’s perspective, as it captures a quiet, residential street on a rainy day. The outdoor setting features a descending staircase leading to a wet, reflective road lined with lush green trees and modest houses. The overcast sky suggests a daytime scene with soft, diffused lighting. The road is flanked by sidewalks and utility poles, enhancing the suburban atmosphere. The rain creates a glossy sheen on the pavement, adding to the tranquil mood. Overlay elements include white text displaying \"Nagoya, Japan\" in the center and \"10 AM - May 2021\" beneath it, which then disappear. A rain symbol follows, accompanied by a red \"14°C\" and \"Rainy weather\" in white text on a blue background, positioned at the bottom of the frame, providing additional information without obstructing the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the wide shot and the general camera movement, but it could be more precise and objective. It uses subjective terms like \"quiet\" and \"tranquility\" and interpretive phrases like \"simulating the experience\" and \"enhancing the sense of depth,\" which should be avoided. The description of the staircase as \"centrally in the frame\" is potentially misleading; it's more likely that the handrails of the staircase are visible in the foreground on the left and right, framing the downward view of the road, a key detail that is missing. The caption also fails to mention the prominent reflections of the trees and buildings on the rain-soaked road, a significant visual element that affects the scene's composition. Furthermore, the description of the camera's descent could be more specific by noting if the camera's downward tilt is maintained or if it adjusts as it moves, and whether it reaches the bottom of the stairs by the end of the clip. Finally, while the overlays are mentioned, their appearance and disappearance could be tied more directly to the camera's movement, for example, specifying if they fade out as the camera begins its descent.",

Reflections of the trees and buildings are prominent on the rain-soaked road, adding a significant visual element to the scene's composition. Power lines crisscross the top of the frame in the background, contributing to the urban atmosphere. The camera is positioned above street level, looking slightly downward, and maintains this tilt as it moves forward, keeping the road and trees centrally aligned. The camera's movement enhances the depth of the scene, and it reaches the bottom of the stairs by the end of the clip. The overlays at the top of the frame fade out as the camera begins its descent, aligning with the camera's movement.",
