    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static shot of a foggy street scene, captured from an eye-level perspective. The cracked asphalt street occupies the lower half and center of the frame, leading from the immediate foreground into the distant, fog-shrouded background where a large white building is faintly visible. A beige building with dark shutters lines the left side of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground. On the right, the front of a red car is positioned in the bottom right foreground, with a black convertible parked just behind it in the right middle ground next to a yellow building. Two stop signs are posted in the middle ground on opposite sides of the street. While the focus is on the scenery, a few pedestrians are present; a group of three walks from left to right across the center of the street in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a quiet, foggy street in what appears to be a historic urban neighborhood. The cracked asphalt reflects the overcast sky, and a thick fog obscures the buildings in the distance, creating a moody and atmospheric quality. On the right, a black convertible and the front of a red car are parked along the curb, while on the left, two people walk along the sidewalk of a stucco building with dark shutters. A group of three people crosses the street in the middle distance, dwarfed by the surrounding architecture and the pervasive mist. The video lacks a main subject, as the focus is placed on the overall environment and the quiet, hazy atmosphere of the scene rather than on any specific individual or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place on a narrow, cracked asphalt street on a very foggy day. The damp road is flanked by buildings; on the left is a beige stucco structure with dark shutters, and on the right is a yellow building with a green door and a green wrought-iron balcony. The dense fog obscures the view down the street, where a large white building is faintly visible. Two red, octagonal STOP signs are positioned on either side of the road. Under the right STOP sign, a black convertible sports car is parked in front of a red one. A few pedestrians are present, with a small group walking across the street in the middle of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the wide, static shot and the primary elements, it could offer more specific details about the spatial dynamics and composition. For example, the description of the pedestrians' movement is somewhat general; the group of three actually emerges from behind the black convertible on the right, crosses the street diagonally away from the camera, and their forms become progressively softer and less distinct as they recede into the denser fog of the left middle ground. The caption also misses a key dynamic element: a single traffic light, suspended over the center of the street in the distant middle ground, which blinks a soft, consistent yellow, providing a rhythmic focal point within the otherwise still scene. Additionally, the spatial relationship of the stop signs could be more precise; the sign on the right is positioned slightly closer to the camera than the one on the left, creating a staggered effect that enhances the perception of depth. Lastly, the beige building on the left does more than just line the frame; its corner is in the immediate foreground, creating a strong diagonal line that leads the eye into the scene, complementing the perspective of the street itself.",
