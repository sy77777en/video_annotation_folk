    "pre_caption": "A low-angle, close-up shot frames the interior of a car's dashboard and door. The dark green upholstered dashboard dominates the foreground, extending from the bottom left across the top of the frame. A reddish-brown panel is set into the dashboard in the center-left of the frame. In the middle ground on the right, the car's side mirror and open door frame are visible against a bright, white background that fills the top right and background of the scene. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, looking slightly upward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up view shows the interior of a car with a two-tone color scheme. The door panel and A-pillar are upholstered in a dark, forest-green material that has a soft, suede-like texture. A contrasting panel on the driver side door is covered in a salmon-pink or terracotta-colored suede. A small, rectangular \"AIRBAG\" label is embossed on this pink section. The driver-side wing mirror, visible in the middle ground, is also colored dark green.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, close-up view captures the interior of a car's driver's side against a bright, overcast sky. The door panel is upholstered in a two-tone, suede-like fabric, with the upper section in dark green and a large inset panel in a reddish-brown color. The word \"AIRBAG\" is embossed to the left of the glove compartment surface. On the left, the open driver's door frame is visible, and on the right, the side mirror is visible. Both are finished in the same dark green material.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and camera angle, but it misses a key dynamic element and could be more precise about the spatial relationships. The video likely features a slow, deliberate upward tilt, beginning with the camera focused on the lower portion of the reddish-brown door panel in the foreground and gradually revealing more of the side mirror and the bright white exterior in the middle ground and background. The caption's description of the \"A-pillar and door\" as a single unit is slightly inaccurate; the A-pillar is a distinct structural element visible in the top-left, separate from the door panel that dominates the center. Furthermore, the description of depth could be improved by specifying that the side mirror is positioned in the middle ground *outside* the vehicle, creating a distinct spatial layer between the car's interior and the distant background. Finally, given the tight framing on the panel's details, describing the shot as an \"extreme close-up\" rather than just a \"close-up\" would more accurately reflect the intimacy of the shot.",
