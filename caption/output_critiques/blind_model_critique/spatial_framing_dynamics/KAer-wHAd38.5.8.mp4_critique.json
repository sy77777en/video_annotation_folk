    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a sunlit neighborhood street, with the camera positioned at approximately the height of a person riding a motorbike. The paved road runs from the bottom center foreground to the center background, creating a strong sense of depth. Residential and commercial buildings are positioned on both the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background. Lush green trees and bushes line both sides of the street, occupying the left, right, and top edges of the frame in the middle ground and background. Utility poles and wires cross the upper part of the frame, mostly in the background and top center. Flags on poles are visible along the roadside, mainly in the middle ground on the right. The sky, filled with scattered clouds, occupies the top background. The camera maintains a consistent height and forward-facing angle, with no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement throughout the video. There is no main subject, as the focus remains on the overall environment and spatial layout of the street and its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a streetscape scenery shot, capturing a sunlit, tranquil neighborhood with a clear blue sky dotted by fluffy white clouds overhead. The scene features a wide, paved road flanked by a mix of residential buildings, lush green trees, and neatly trimmed bushes, all bathed in bright daylight. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the peaceful atmosphere, vibrant greenery, and the spaciousness of the street rather than any specific object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to showcase the ambiance and scale of the neighborhood, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video offers a first-person perspective from a motorbike rider navigating a quiet, sunlit street in a small town or village. The clear blue skies with scattered white clouds suggest it's midday. The road is paved and lined with a mix of residential and commercial buildings, featuring white or green facades and tiled roofs. Lush green trees and neatly trimmed bushes border the street, casting patches of shade on the ground. Utility poles and wires cross overhead, and flags are visible on poles along the roadside. The scene captures the presence of other motorbike riders on the street, either approaching or moving away from the camera, while other figures and vehicles are visible farther in the distance. The overall environment is calm, with sunlight highlighting the vibrant greenery and the clean, well-maintained appearance of the area.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and the general street layout, but it misses key spatial details and dynamics. It fails to mention the most immediate foreground elements: the motorbike's handlebars and a portion of the front fairing, which are constantly visible at the bottom of the frame and are essential for anchoring the point-of-view. The description of \"other riders\" is too generic; the video specifically shows a single scooter approaching from the background and passing on the right, while a group of three motorbikes overtakes the camera on the left, moving from the middle ground to the foreground before exiting the frame. Furthermore, the camera's movement is not just \"forward\" but includes a slight, continuous lean to the right as the rider navigates a gentle curve, causing the buildings in the left background to shift toward the center of the frame. The caption also oversimplifies the depth of the flags, which are positioned at staggered intervals in both the right foreground and middle ground, creating a repeating pattern that is not mentioned. Finally, the description should explicitly state this is a wide shot taken from the rider's eye-level height.",
