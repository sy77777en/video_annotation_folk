    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot, where a woman is positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, standing at the edge of a vast green grassy field that occupies the foreground and middle ground. Behind her, a tall cornfield stretches horizontally across the background, with a dark pine forest visible further back, predominantly on the right side, and distant mountains in the far background on the left, under a pale sky at the top. As the woman runs towards the camera, the shot transitions from a wide shot to a medium shot, and then briefly to a close-up where her head moves out of the top of the frame, leaving only her body from the neck down visible in the foreground. Subsequently, as she runs away from the camera, moving towards the right side of the frame, the shot returns to a wide shot, showing her full figure receding into the middle ground. The grassy field remains in the foreground and middle ground throughout, while the cornfield, forest, and mountains maintain their background positions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman with long hair that is brown at the top and gradually transitions to blonde. She is wearing a white two-piece outfit consisting of a bandeau top and loose-fitting pants, paired with white sneakers. She is seen running in a grassy field. Initially, she is visible in a wide shot. As she runs towards the camera, she becomes larger in the frame, and for a moment, only her body from the neck down is visible as her head moves out of the top of the frame. Subsequently, as she runs away from the camera, the view returns to a wider shot showing her full figure again.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot from a handheld panoramic camera, with noticeable distortion, shows a person running through a lush green grassy field. In the background, a tall, dense cornfield lines the edge of the meadow, with a dark green pine forest and distant mountains visible under a pale sky, indicating sunset or dusk. The camera moves with the person, capturing the motion through the long grass. Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen, displaying the words \"Ohh,\" \"yes,\" \"yes, yes, yes,\" and \"that's it.\" At the end of the video, part of the filmer’s left hand appears, making an \"OK\" gesture.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a woman in a white dress running on an outdoor grassy field. Initially, the frame shows a wide shot. As she gets closer, she becomes larger in the frame, with her head exiting the frame, leaving only her body below the head visible. Then, as she moves away from the camera, the shot returns to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Your description of the initial scene is clear, but the caption lacks clarity regarding the transition and the resulting spatial changes. The term \"subsequently\" is ambiguous; it should specify if there is a hard cut between the woman running towards the camera and running away. A cut seems likely, as the complete disappearance of the \"tall cornfield\" is a major environmental shift that a simple change in the subject's direction wouldn't explain. If the camera instead pivoted 180 degrees to follow her, the caption should state this and describe how the positions of the background mountains and forest are now reversed (e.g., the forest is now on the left). Furthermore, the description of her running towards the camera could be more precise; rather than saying \"only her head moves out of the top,\" it would be more accurate to describe the shot as tightening on her, effectively becoming a medium shot of her torso as she gets too close for the wide frame. Finally, the caption omits the camera's height, which, based on the description, appears to be positioned at a low angle to emphasize the vastness of the field and the woman's figure against it.",
