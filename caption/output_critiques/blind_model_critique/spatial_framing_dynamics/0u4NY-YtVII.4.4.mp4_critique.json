    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide-angle view of a world map, featuring continents in dark gray against a lighter gray background. Various locations in North America and South America are initially marked with blue squares in the top left and bottom left areas of the screen. These markers are positioned in the foreground, drawing immediate attention. As the video progresses, a yellow curved line emerges from the middle right section of the map, originating from Europe and extending across the Atlantic Ocean towards South America. This line is prominently displayed in the middle ground, creating a visual connection between the two continents. The camera then transitions smoothly, focusing on Uruguay, located in the bottom left area of the frame. Uruguay is highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text, now occupying the central foreground. The surrounding countries remain in dark gray, forming the background. Throughout the video, the camera maintains a top-down perspective, providing a clear overview of the geographical connections and transitions. The copyright notice remains consistently in the lower-left corner throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a world map with various regions highlighted. Initially, several locations across North America and South America are marked with blue squares. A yellow curved line then appears, directly connecting a point in Europe to Uruguay, crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The focus shifts to Uruguay, where the country is distinctly highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text. This sequence suggests a journey or connection between Europe and Uruguay. The map's design uses dark tones for continents, drawing attention to the specified regions and routes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with a light gray world map, featuring dark gray continents and light gray country borders. In the lower-left corner, the text reads: \"[17]; © OpenStreetMap contributors © CARTO.\" Initially, the map highlights the Americas, Europe, and Africa with moving blue squares that disappear. An orange line originates from Europe, connecting to Uruguay, which is highlighted in light blue with its name displayed. The video maintains an objective perspective, focusing on geographical representation and connections without indicating time of day or weather conditions. The minimalistic style uses clean lines and contrasting colors to convey information effectively.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes the visual elements (world map, continents, markers, line, labels) and their attributes (colors, shapes).\n*   The spatial descriptions are precise. It correctly identifies the 2D positions (top left, bottom left, middle right, central) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) of the various elements as they appear and change.\n*   The description of movement and transitions (the line emerging, the camera smoothly focusing) is accurate and reflects the dynamic nature of the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is comprehensive, covering all the key requirements of the instructions.\n*   It establishes the initial shot size (\"wide-angle view\") and camera perspective (\"top-down\").\n*   It details the spatial framing of multiple elements at different stages: the initial markers, the emerging line, and the final highlighted country.\n*   It successfully describes the change in framing, noting how Uruguay transitions from a location in the bottom left to the central foreground subject.\n*   It even includes a minor, static element (the copyright notice), demonstrating thorough observation.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Spatial Framing:** The caption excels at its primary goal of describing spatial framing and dynamics, using the specified terminology (shot size, position, depth, height) correctly.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and clear. It forms a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to follow.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. Phrases like \"drawing immediate attention\" and \"prominently displayed\" are used effectively to describe visual hierarchy and emphasis, which is a key part of spatial analysis, rather than expressing a subjective opinion.\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption strictly describes what is visible, avoiding any speculative or ambiguous language.\n*   **Format:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and perfectly structured to provide a clear and objective analysis of the video's spatial composition and dynamics.",
