    "pre_caption": "The video uses an extreme wide shot to capture the landscape, with the terraced rice paddies filling most of the frame from the bottom foreground to the top background. The rectangular plots and water channels are arranged in a geometric pattern, extending horizontally across the frame from left to right and receding into the distance, creating a strong sense of depth. Small huts are scattered throughout, with some positioned in the bottom left and bottom right foreground, while others appear in the middle ground and background toward the center and sides. The dense forest forms a horizontal band along the top background, and the misty horizon is visible at the upper edge of the frame. The camera is positioned above the scene, looking down at a high angle, which emphasizes the scale and layout of the fields and elements. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position during the video; the framing remains consistent, maintaining a broad aerial perspective over the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video captures a serene landscape scenery focusing on expansive rice paddies, with occasional appearances of huts that blend into the environment. The emphasis remains on the atmosphere, showcasing a patchwork of flooded fields with varying shades of green and brown. The paddies are neatly divided by narrow paths and irrigation channels, creating a geometric pattern. In the background, a dense line of trees and a misty horizon add depth, enhancing the sense of scale and tranquility. The presence of huts complements the vastness and serene beauty of the rural landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone shows an expansive outdoor landscape of terraced rice fields bordered by dense green forest. The fields are divided into long, rectangular plots separated by narrow, water-filled channels that reflect the sky, with some areas displaying vibrant green growth and others showing brown, freshly tilled earth. Small wooden huts with sloped roofs are scattered throughout the fields, and the terrain is mostly flat with gentle undulations. The weather is clear, with soft daylight illuminating the scene, and the distant background fades into a light mist above the treetops.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption accurately identifies all key visual elements (terraced rice paddies, huts, forest, horizon) and describes their spatial relationships with high precision. It correctly specifies the shot size (\"extreme wide shot\") at the beginning, as instructed. It thoroughly covers the 2D positions (bottom left, top, center), 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and the camera's high-angle position. It also correctly notes the static nature of the shot, fulfilling the requirement to describe any changes (or lack thereof).\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Structure:** The caption is well-structured, starting with the overall shot, then detailing the main and secondary elements, and concluding with the camera perspective and dynamics. This logical flow makes it easy to understand.\n    *   **Spatial Focus:** It remains strictly focused on spatial framing and dynamics, describing how elements are arranged and perceived in terms of depth and position, rather than their narrative or emotional context.\n    *   **Language and Tone:** The language is simple, objective, and natural. It avoids emotional adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"stunning\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\"), sticking to factual observation.\n    *   **Format:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is concise, informative, and technically precise in its description of the video's spatial composition.",
