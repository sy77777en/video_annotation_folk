    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective framed by a viewport in the extreme foreground, the scene is set in a dense underwater forest. A gloved hand is positioned in the lower right foreground. The middle ground and background are filled with tall, stalk-like structures that rise from the seabed, with some positioned on the left and right to form a central path. Glowing vines are wrapped around the stalks in the right middle ground, while clusters of small, glowing creatures drift in the center and left middle ground. The camera, positioned at a height level with the mid-section of the surrounding structures, moves forward through the central path, navigating between the structures, and pans slightly to the right, revealing more of the environment in the right middle ground and background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video offers a first-person view of a fantastical, bioluminescent underwater environment, framed by the orange-red interior of a helmet or viewport. The dark, aquatic landscape is populated with tall, greenish-brown, stalk-like structures that resemble giant mushrooms, distributed at different heights along the stalks. These mushrooms have flat, disc-shaped caps with dark green tops. Glowing, turquoise-colored vines spiral around some of the stalks, adorned with small, glowing green and purple lights. Schools of tiny, glowing white creatures drift through the water. Occasionally, a pair of gloved hands, part of an orange and black suit, is visible in the lower part of the frame.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, underwater environment resembling a forest. Tall, stalk-like structures with flat, orange-red-bottomed, disc-shaped mushrooms distributed at different heights along the stalks rise from a sandy seabed. The stalks have a green, mossy texture and are illuminated by various forms of bioluminescence, including glowing green and purple spots, and strings of bright teal lights that wrap around them. Clusters of small, glowing white creatures swim in the dark, greenish water. The view is framed by a dark orange border, suggesting a helmet or viewport, and a pair of gloved orange and black hands is visible in the lower part of the frame. A faint text overlay in the bottom left corner says \"Loopy Longplays.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very effectively follows the detailed instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres to all stylistic and content requirements.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene and its elements (viewport, gloved hand, stalk-like structures, glowing vines, creatures) is precise and fact-based.\n*   The spatial positioning is correctly identified: the hand is in the \"lower right foreground,\" the stalks are in the \"middle ground and background,\" and the camera movement \"forward\" and \"pan to the right\" is accurately described.\n*   The effect of the camera movement—\"revealing more of the environment in the right middle ground and background\"—is a correct and important observation of the spatial dynamics.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies and describes the spatial properties of all key elements in the scene.\n*   It provides a thorough analysis of the camera's role, including its height (\"level with the mid-section of the surrounding structures\") and its complex movement.\n*   It effectively combines the 2D position (left, right, center), 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background), and relative height for multiple elements within a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Spatial Focus:** The entire caption is dedicated to describing spatial framing and dynamics, as requested.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and clear. It conveys a large amount of spatial information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objectivity:** It correctly avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"eerie\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Structure:** The caption is well-structured. It begins with the overall framing, moves to specific elements and their positions, and concludes with the camera's movement and its impact on the scene.\n*   **Shot Size:** While it doesn't use a specific term like \"wide shot,\" it effectively describes the framing from a \"first-person perspective framed by a viewport,\" which is an appropriate and informative way to establish the shot's nature, fully satisfying the instruction's intent.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example of how to follow the given instructions. It is detailed, objective, and perfectly captures the spatial composition and movement within the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective framed by a viewport in the extreme foreground, the scene unfolds in a dense underwater forest. A gloved hand appears in the lower right foreground. The middle ground and background are populated with tall, stalk-like structures rising from the seabed, creating a central path flanked by some on the left and right. Glowing vines entwine the stalks in the right middle ground, while clusters of small, glowing creatures drift in the center and left middle ground. The camera, positioned at a height level with the mid-section of the surrounding structures, advances through the central path, weaving between the structures, and pans slightly to the right, unveiling more of the environment in the right middle ground and background.",
