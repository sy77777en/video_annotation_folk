    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a highway scene, capturing an expansive view of the road and its surroundings. The camera remains at a consistent height, likely mounted on a vehicle, providing a steady perspective of the road stretching into the distance. The road occupies the central portion of the frame, with white lane markings clearly visible. Trees line both sides of the road, positioned in the left and right areas of the frame, forming a natural corridor in the middle ground and background. The sky, showing hints of sunset, is located at the top of the frame, contributing to the overall ambiance. Vehicles appear intermittently, moving through the scene from various directions; they enter and exit the frame, altering the dynamic slightly but maintaining the focus on the road and its environment. The camera's position remains constant throughout, emphasizing the continuity and flow of the highway. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera angle, ensuring a stable and continuous view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the open road and surrounding nature rather than a specific object. The wide view and perspective highlight the scale and expanse of the scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a dashcam POV mounted on a vehicle, shows a highway scene during the early evening. The road stretches ahead, flanked by dense trees on both sides, creating a natural corridor. The sky is clear with a hint of sunset on the horizon, casting a soft glow. Multiple vehicles, including a red car, are visible on the road, with some moving in the same direction as the camera and others traveling in the opposite direction on the other side of the guardrail. The asphalt is smooth and dark, with white lane markings. The scene conveys a sense of motion and transition as the vehicle progresses along the highway, with the changing light subtly indicating the passage of time.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas for improvement to fully align with the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is generally accurate in its description of the scene's elements (wide shot, highway, trees, sky, vehicles).\n*   However, it violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements\" by using the phrase \"**likely** mounted on a vehicle.\" The description should only state what is visible or certain.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the shot size, the 2D position of most elements (road in center, trees on left/right, sky at top), and the 3D position of the trees (middle ground and background).\n*   It is incomplete in its description of the moving vehicles. While it mentions they \"enter and exit the frame,\" it fails to describe their specific spatial path (e.g., moving from the background toward the foreground in the center, or moving from left to right across the middle ground).\n*   The description of the camera height is not fully complete. It notes the height is \"consistent\" but doesn't describe it *relative* to the scene (e.g., at a low angle close to the road, or at a driver's eye-level).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly begins with the **shot size** (\"wide shot\").\n    *   It successfully describes both the **2D and 3D positions** for the static elements (trees).\n    *   It correctly notes the absence of changes in shot size or camera angle.\n    *   It is written as a single, coherent paragraph in simple English.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   It violates the rule against **speculative language** (\"likely\").\n    *   It includes interpretive, non-spatial descriptions, such as \"contributing to the overall ambiance\" and \"emphasizing the continuity and flow of the highway,\" which deviate from the goal of describing only **spatial framing and dynamics**.\n    *   The description of the vehicles' movement is too general and lacks the required detail on their spatial dynamics within the frame.",
