    "pre_caption": "This scenery shot begins as a wide shot, capturing an informational sign in the foreground at the bottom of the frame. In the middle ground, a low concrete wall separates the viewer from a dirt enclosure containing blue-gray posts on the left and a pile of rocks on the right. The background consists of trees and a building. The camera then tilts downward, transitioning into a high-angle close-up shot that centers on the informational sign. In this final framing, the sign occupies the majority of the screen in the foreground, with only small portions of the grass in front and the concrete wall behind it visible at the bottom and top edges of the frame, respectively.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures a scenery shot of an informational sign at a zoo, positioned in front of an animal enclosure. The camera tilts downward, adjusting to a high angle to properly frame the light-colored sign, which provides details about the \"Indian Rhinoceros\" (Rhinoceros unicornis) in multiple languages, complete with a habitat map and a photograph of the animal. Behind the sign, the enclosure features a dirt ground, a low concrete wall, a series of thick blue-gray posts, and a large pile of dark rocks, all surrounded by patches of green grass and trees. The video focuses on the descriptive sign, presenting the static, informational context of the zoo environment rather than any specific animal or action within the enclosure.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An outdoor scene at what appears to be a zoo focuses on an informational sign for the Indian Rhinoceros (*Rhinoceros unicornis*). The sign, set in a light gray frame against a low concrete wall, features text in Japanese and English, a small map of India, and a photo of the animal. In the background, a dirt enclosure contains large rocks, patches of green grass, and a row of blue posts. Trees and a building with a pale, textured facade are visible beyond the enclosure. The camera tilts downward to focus on the sign throughout the shot.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the scenery. It then changes to a close-up shot.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately outlines the basic camera movement and subject framing, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and visual details. It correctly identifies the final shot as high-angle but omits the initial camera height, which appears to be at an eye-level position relative to the overall scene. The description of the middle ground is generic; the \"blue-gray posts\" could be more specifically described as part of a weathered wooden fence, and the \"pile of rocks\" might be a small, deliberate rock formation, details which would add more spatial context. A key dynamic is missed in the final shot: the shallow depth of field. The caption should note that as the camera focuses on the sign, the grass in the immediate foreground and the concrete wall in the background become soft and out of focus, which emphasizes the sign's position. Additionally, the description of the sign as simply \"centered\" is incomplete; it is a plaque angled slightly upward, meaning its top edge is spatially further from the camera than its bottom edge.",
