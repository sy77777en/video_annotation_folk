    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a large tree trunk occupies the right foreground. A cheetah is positioned in the middle ground, initially emerging from behind the right side of the tree. It walks from right to left across the center of the frame, moving through a clearing of dirt and grass before lowering its head to the ground. The background is filled with green trees and foliage. The camera is positioned at the cheetah's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A cheetah with a tan coat covered in black spots and a long, ringed tail with a white tip walks from right to left. It is partially obscured by the dark, textured trunk of a large tree in the foreground. The cheetah lowers its head to the ground as it moves across a patch of dirt in a grassy, wooded area.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a grassy, wooded area during the daytime. A large, dark tree trunk with textured bark stands prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the view. The ground is covered in vibrant green grass, interspersed with patches of bare, brown earth. In the background, a mix of smaller trees and green foliage creates a dense, natural setting. A cheetah with a spotted coat walks through a clearing in the mid-ground, moving from right to left behind the main tree.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a clear sequence of events, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The term 'wide shot' might be inaccurate; if the cheetah is a prominent figure for most of its walk, 'medium-long shot' or 'full shot' would better describe its framing. The description of the tree trunk could be more specific, for instance, noting if it fills the entire right edge of the frame, creating a strong vertical element that the cheetah is revealed from. While the cheetah's right-to-left movement is noted, the caption misses the opportunity to describe any change in depth—for example, if the cheetah walks on a slight diagonal, moving from the middle ground closer to the foreground as it crosses the frame. Furthermore, the caption implies a static camera, but if the camera performs a slow pan to follow the cheetah, this crucial movement should be included as it directly affects the framing. Finally, adding a detail about the depth of field, such as specifying that the background foliage is soft-focus, would provide a more complete picture of the scene's depth and composition.",
