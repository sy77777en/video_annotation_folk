    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium close-up shot. A woman is positioned in the left-middle ground of the frame, initially facing towards the left side of the frame. A partially visible man is situated in the right foreground, also facing towards the left. The woman then turns her head to her right, directing her gaze towards the man. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A dark-skinned woman with long, dark, wavy hair is seated in a helicopter seat, facing the left side of the frame. She wears a dark textured jacket over a lighter top and a headset with a microphone, speaking continuously while her right hand rests on a control device. Initially, she is facing the left side of the frame, then turns left towards the camera, her eyes widening and mouth opening slightly as she looks at a partially visible light-skinned man on the right side of the frame. The man, seen mostly from the side and back of his head, has a visible tattoo on his neck/shoulder area and wears a light-colored t-shirt and a headset with a microphone. He is seated to her left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set inside the cockpit of a helicopter during the daytime. The interior is moderately lit, with visible structural elements of the aircraft. Two individuals are present, both wearing headsets with microphones. The person on the left, a woman with dark hair, wears a dark, textured jacket. The person on the right, partially visible, wears a light-colored shirt. Through the cockpit windows, a blurry, light-colored background is discernible, suggesting an urban environment or sky. The overall impression is of an active flight.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption contains a significant directional error, stating the woman turns \"to her left\" to look at the man positioned in the \"right foreground,\" which is a physical impossibility; she would have to turn to her right. The description of the man as \"partially visible\" is vague; specifying which parts are visible, such as the back of his head and his right shoulder, would provide more clarity. Furthermore, the spatial relationship between the subjects and the environment could be described more cohesively. For example, instead of listing the window as a separate element, it would be more accurate to state that the woman is initially looking out the window on the left side of the frame. The description of the background as being seen \"through\" the window is good, but the window's position relative to the woman is described as \"behind\" her, which seems unlikely; it is more probable that she is sitting next to it, with the window occupying the left portion of the frame. Clarifying these spatial relationships and correcting the direction of movement would make the description more accurate.",
