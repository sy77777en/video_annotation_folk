    "pre_caption": "In an extreme wide shot, a vast, dark chamber is framed from a low angle. Numerous dark, rectangular boxes are arranged in a grid across the floor, extending from the foreground to the background and occupying the bottom half of the frame. In the upper center background, several pale, human-like figures hang upside down, suspended near a bright, diffuse light source. Thin, dark wires connect both the boxes and the figures to the unseen ceiling, creating strong vertical lines that enhance the sense of height and depth. A small figure, initially positioned in the middle ground slightly right of center, runs towards the bottom left, moving from the middle ground into the foreground as it navigates between the boxes. The camera remains static and is positioned at the level of the small running figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, hazy environment, several pale, unclothed human figures hang upside down, suspended by thin, dark wires attached to the ceiling. Their bodies are limp and appear lifeless. Below them, arranged in a grid-like pattern on the floor, are numerous dark, rectangular boxes. Each box has a small, glowing red light on its top surface and is connected to the ceiling by a thin, dark pole or wire. A single, bright, diffuse light source at the top of the scene illuminates the hanging figures.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a vast, dark, and foggy indoor chamber. Numerous thin, dark cables descend from the high, unseen ceiling to the dark, reflective floor. At the bottom of each cable rests a dark, cubic box with a single glowing red light. High above, near a bright, hazy light source at the top center of the room, pale, human-like figures hang suspended in the gloom. A small figure runs across the floor, navigating the grid-like arrangement of the boxes. The scene is rendered in a monochromatic color scheme, dominated by shades of grey and black.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to all instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its use of descriptive terminology. It correctly identifies the **shot size** as an \"extreme wide shot\" appropriate for a \"vast... chamber.\"\n*   It uses precise, objective language to describe elements (e.g., \"dark, rectangular boxes,\" \"pale, human-like figures,\" \"bright, diffuse light source\") without making unverified assumptions.\n*   The description of movement is specific and accurate, detailing the subject's path in both 2D (\"towards the bottom left\") and 3D space (\"from the middle ground into the foreground\").\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is exceptionally thorough. It successfully describes the **shot size**, the **2D position** (upper center, bottom half), **3D depth** (foreground, middle ground, background), and **camera height/angle** (low angle, at the level of the figure) for all key elements.\n*   It effectively captures the **spatial dynamics** by detailing the running figure's starting and ending positions and trajectory.\n*   It includes the state of the camera (\"remains static\"), which is a crucial detail for understanding the scene's framing.\n*   It even analyzes compositional elements (\"strong vertical lines that enhance the sense of height and depth\"), which directly relates to the instruction to describe \"spatial framing.\"\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Format:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as required.\n*   **Content:** It focuses strictly on spatial framing and dynamics, avoiding emotional language, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and any information not visually present (\"unseen ceiling\" is an acceptable inference based on the hanging wires).\n*   **Structure:** The caption is logically structured, starting with the overall shot, moving to static background and foreground elements, describing the primary subject's movement, and concluding with the camera's properties. This creates a clear and easy-to-follow description.\n*   **Language:** The English is simple, natural, and concise, making the complex spatial information easy to understand.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is detailed, precise, and perfectly formatted, successfully translating a complex visual scene into a clear and objective textual description of its spatial composition and movement.",
