    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a female-form mannequin shown from the hips up, positioned centrally in the frame. The mannequin stands with its hands on its hips, occupying the foreground. Its reflective, metallic surface contrasts with the background, which consists of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light from the side creates a distinct outline on the mannequin, enhancing its presence against the background. The camera remains at the mannequin's level throughout the video. Occasionally, the mannequin turns its head slightly, introducing subtle movement within the otherwise static composition. The background remains constant, with no changes in the spatial arrangement of elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A female-form mannequin is shown from the hips up, standing with its hands on its hips. It is dressed in a light gray business suit, which includes a two-button blazer over a v-neck top. The mannequin's body, including its hands and featureless, oval-shaped face, is made of a reflective, silver-colored metallic material. Its dark hair is tied behind its head. Throughout the video, the mannequin occasionally turns its head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A figure with a metallic, featureless head stands with its hands on its hips in an indoor setting. The figure wears a grey, two-button business suit over a light-colored v-neck shirt. The background consists of a wall made of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light illuminates the figure from the side, creating a distinct outline.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This medium shot shows a mannequin from the hip up. Throughout the video, the mannequin occasionally turns their head. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the initial medium shot but fails to mention the subtle, slow zoom-in that occurs, which gradually reframes the subject into a medium close-up, focusing more on the torso and head by the end. The description of the movement as a \"slight head turn\" is also an oversimplification; the mannequin actually rotates its entire upper torso slowly to its left, causing its spatial position to shift from the center to the center-left of the frame. Furthermore, the analysis of depth is incomplete as it omits a small, out-of-focus crystal sculpture positioned in the bottom-right foreground, which is a key element in establishing the scene's depth. Lastly, while the blue side light is noted, the caption misses a crucial dynamic element: a warm, yellow light that periodically fades in from the top left, casting shifting highlights on the mannequin's metallic surface and altering the visual texture of both the subject and the wooden background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a female-form mannequin shown from the hips up, centrally positioned in the frame.
