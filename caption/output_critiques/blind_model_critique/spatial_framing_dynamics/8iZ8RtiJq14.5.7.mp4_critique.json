    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a female-form mannequin shown from the hips up, positioned centrally in the frame. The mannequin stands with its hands on its hips, occupying the foreground. Its reflective, metallic surface contrasts with the background, which consists of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light from the side creates a distinct outline on the mannequin, enhancing its presence against the background. The camera remains at the mannequin's level throughout the video. Occasionally, the mannequin turns its head slightly, introducing subtle movement within the otherwise static composition. The background remains constant, with no changes in the spatial arrangement of elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A female-form mannequin is shown from the hips up, standing with its hands on its hips. It is dressed in a light gray business suit, which includes a two-button blazer over a v-neck top. The mannequin's body, including its hands and featureless, oval-shaped face, is made of a reflective, silver-colored metallic material. Its dark hair is tied behind its head. Throughout the video, the mannequin occasionally turns its head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A figure with a metallic, featureless head stands with its hands on its hips in an indoor setting. The figure wears a grey, two-button business suit over a light-colored v-neck shirt. The background consists of a wall made of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light illuminates the figure from the side, creating a distinct outline.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: This medium shot shows a mannequin from the hip up. Throughout the video, the mannequin occasionally turns their head. \n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It meticulously follows all instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and stylistically correct.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the **shot size** (\"medium shot... from the hips up\"), the subject's **2D position** (\"centrally\"), and its **3D position** (\"foreground\").\n*   It correctly describes the **camera's height** (\"at the mannequin's level\") and the **dynamics** of the scene, noting the mannequin's \"subtle movement\" and the static nature of the camera and background.\n*   The description of the background (\"vertical, brown wooden planks\") and the lighting (\"blue light from the side\") adds precise, objective detail.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers every required element: shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and spatial changes/movement.\n*   It analyzes both the primary subject (mannequin) and key background elements (planks, light), providing their spatial context as instructed.\n*   It clearly states what remains static, which is crucial for describing the overall spatial dynamics of the shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It is concise yet highly informative, focusing exclusively on spatial framing and visible elements.\n*   It successfully avoids emotional adjectives, subjective language, and speculative statements (\"might be,\" \"appears\"). The phrase \"enhancing its presence\" is used in a functional sense to describe the effect of the light on depth perception, which is acceptable within the context of spatial analysis.\n*   The format is correct, with no introductory text or Markdown.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a medium shot of a female-form mannequin, captured from the hips up and centrally positioned in the frame. The mannequin stands with its hands on its hips, prominently occupying the foreground. Its reflective, metallic surface contrasts with the background of vertical, brown wooden planks. A blue light from the side casts a distinct outline on the mannequin, enhancing its presence against the background. The camera remains level with the mannequin throughout the video. Occasionally, the mannequin slightly turns its head, introducing subtle movement within the otherwise static composition. The background remains unchanged, with no alterations in the spatial arrangement of elements.",
