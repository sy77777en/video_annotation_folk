    "pre_caption": "This full shot is framed on an open safe, which is positioned in the center-right of the frame and set into a wall in the middle ground. The safe's door is swung open toward the right edge of the frame. Inside, papers rest on two shelves, also in the middle ground. In the foreground, the top of a lamp is visible on the left, sitting on a table that occupies the bottom-left corner. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, and the framing remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An open, dark-colored safe is built into a wall, its door swung open to the right. The edge of the thick door appears distorted, suggesting it may have been forced open, and features three small, glowing pinkish-purple circular lights arranged vertically. The safe's frame is silvery with a distorted, almost melted appearance. Inside, two shelves are visible. On the bottom shelf rests a stack of white papers, with a circular emblem visible on the topmost sheet, while multiple sheets of paper lie on the upper shelf. To the left of the safe, a table lamp with a teal, bell-shaped shade sits on a teal table. The lamp has an ornate, fluted base that appears to be made of gold or brass.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark room bathed in blue and purple light, an open safe is set into a wall. The safe has a dark frame, and its door, which is ajar, features three glowing purple lights along its edge. Inside, two shelves hold stacks of paper, with a circular seal visible on the documents on the lower shelf. To the left, a lamp with a teal shade and a golden base rests on a small table.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject (an open safe) and its key features (open door, papers inside). It precisely describes the 2D position of the safe as \"center-right\" and the 3D position as \"middle ground.\" The description of the foreground elements—a lamp on the \"left\" and a table in the \"bottom-left corner\"—is also spatially correct. The statement that the camera is at the subject's level and the framing is static accurately reflects the visual information.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete and successfully addresses all components of the instruction.\n*   **Shot Size:** It begins by specifying the shot size (\"full shot\").\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It provides both the 2D position within the frame (center-right, left, bottom-left) and the 3D depth (foreground, middle ground) for every element mentioned.\n*   **Camera Height:** It explicitly states the camera's height relative to the subject (\"at the subject's level\").\n*   **Dynamics:** It correctly notes the lack of movement by stating the framing \"remains static.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption demonstrates excellent adherence to the instructions.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n*   It focuses entirely on spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n*   It follows the logical structure of describing the main subject first, followed by other elements in the scene.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions precisely. It is concise, factually accurate, and provides a comprehensive description of the scene's spatial composition without including any unnecessary or speculative information.",
