    "pre_caption": "In a static full shot, a young child stands in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground. In the foreground, a curb extends horizontally across the bottom of the frame. A tall, dark fence is visible in the background, spanning the width of the scene behind the child. The camera is positioned at the child's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dark, blue-tinted scene, a young child with fair skin and short, dark hair stands still on a sidewalk. The child wears a light-colored collared shirt, a dark skirt or shorts, light-colored socks, and dark shoes. They are holding a dark, folded piece of fabric, possibly a jacket or blanket, clutched to their chest. The child faces forward, looking directly ahead with a neutral expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors at night, bathed in a deep blue light. A young child stands on a paved sidewalk next to a cobblestone street. Behind the child, a tall, dark, wrought-iron fence with decorative scrollwork and diamond-shaped patterns extends across the background. The area between the sidewalk and the fence consists of dark, unpaved ground. The overall lighting is dim, casting the surroundings in shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the static full shot and the basic spatial layers of foreground, middle ground, and background. However, it lacks the dynamic detail expected for a video description, reading more like an analysis of a still photograph. It fails to specify the child's orientation—in the video, the child is turned three-quarters away from the camera, looking toward the top left of the frame, which is a critical aspect of their spatial presence. The description also omits any subtle movements; the child is not perfectly still but sways slightly, and their hair moves in a light breeze, which are minor but important spatial dynamics. Furthermore, the environment could be described with more spatial precision. The caption doesn't mention that the child is standing on a cracked asphalt surface, which is texturally distinct from the concrete curb, nor does it note the long shadow the child casts behind them toward the fence, an element that helps define the scene's depth and the light's direction. Adding these details about the subject's orientation, micro-movements, and more specific environmental elements would provide a richer and more accurate account of the spatial composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a static full shot, a young child stands in the center-right of the frame, positioned in the middle ground on a cracked asphalt surface. The child is turned three-quarters away from the camera, looking toward the top left of the frame. In the foreground, a concrete curb extends horizontally across the bottom of the frame, contrasting with the asphalt. The child sways slightly, and their hair moves gently in a light breeze, adding subtle motion to the scene. A tall, dark fence spans the width of the background, and the child casts a long shadow behind them toward the fence, indicating the direction of the light and enhancing the scene's depth. The camera is positioned at the child's level, capturing these dynamic and textural details.",
