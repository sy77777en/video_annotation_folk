    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a high-angle wide shot of a digital map, where the RMS Carpathia is located in the bottom right of the frame, in the middle ground. A glowing red dashed line extends diagonally from a red dot in the top left background to the ship's position. As the scene progresses, the camera zooms in and tracks the ship, transitioning the view to a full shot. The ship moves from the bottom right toward the center of the frame, following the red line. Throughout this movement, a compass icon remains stationary in the bottom left foreground, while coordinate text boxes are positioned at the top and right edges of the frame. The entire scene is overlaid with a white grid that moves relative to the camera, creating the illusion of the ship's forward motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white ocean liner, identified by red text as the \"RMS CARPATHIA,\" is shown from a high-angle perspective on a dark, grid-lined navigational chart. The chart's background is black with a white, marbled texture, resembling a dark, choppy sea. White text boxes display changing longitude and latitude coordinates, such as \"LONG: 49.98\" and \"LAT: 41.36.\" A glowing, dashed red line extends across the grid from a red dot in the upper left, indicating a path toward the ship's position. In the bottom left corner, a circular icon with a directional arrow is present.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An animated digital map shows a nighttime scene over a dark, textured body of water, overlaid with a white grid of latitude and longitude lines. A grey, single-funnel steamship, labeled \"RMS CARPATHIA\" in red text, travels along a glowing red dashed line starting from a red dot. A faint white frame with tick marks surrounds the image, with labels for longitude and latitude along the top and right edges, displaying the ship's current coordinates. As the ship sails, the longitude decreases from 50.00 to 49.91, and the latitude decreases from 41.37 to 41.33. A circular icon with an arrow is visible in the bottom left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general camera and subject movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the nature of the motion. For instance, the compass icon and coordinate text boxes are mentioned, but their specific, static positions within the frame, such as the top right and bottom left corners, are omitted. The description of the camera's path as two separate movements—\"moves to the right, downward, and forward, then continues moving forward and downward\"—feels disjointed; a more accurate description for a smooth animation might be a single, continuous arcing motion that swoops in towards the ship. Furthermore, the initial placement of the ship in the \"middle ground\" of a wide map shot might be better described as the background, with the caption then highlighting its clear transition to the foreground as the camera closes in. The caption also misses an opportunity to identify the \"red dot\" in the top left, which is visually labeled \"Titanic's Last Known Position,\" failing to establish the full spatial context of the ship's journey. Finally, the description of the final \"full shot\" is incomplete; it should specify that the camera settles into a slightly high-angle three-quarter view, with the Carpathia now positioned centrally and angled toward the top right, clearly occupying the foreground.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a high-angle wide shot of a digital map, where the RMS Carpathia is initially located in the background. A glowing red dashed line extends diagonally from a red dot labeled \"Titanic's Last Known Position\" in the top left corner to the ship's position. As the scene progresses, the camera executes a smooth, continuous arcing motion, swooping in towards the ship.
