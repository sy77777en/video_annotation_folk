    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a computer monitor is positioned in the middle ground, occupying the frame from the left edge to the right. Centrally displayed on the monitor are four horizontally stacked graphs, each featuring a bright yellow waveform that continuously scrolls from right to left. A line of text is visible in the bottom-left corner of the screen. In the foreground on the right, a blurred, curved object partially obscures the monitor. The camera remains static and is positioned at the monitor's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a close-up of a dark monitor screen, which shows four distinct horizontal graphs. Each graph features a bright yellow, fluctuating line representing electroencephalogram (EEG) data, plotted against a black background. A fine white grid is overlaid on each graph, and white numerical labels for the y-axis, including \"100,\" \"50,\" \"0,\" and \"-50,\" are visible to the left. At the bottom left corner of the screen, there is a line of small, white text. Partially visible on the right side of the screen is a blurred, light-colored, smooth, curved object, reflecting the ambient green-tinged light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit room with a green ambiance, a computer monitor displays four horizontally stacked graphs. The graphs feature a black background with a white grid, upon which bright yellow, fluctuating waveforms scroll continuously from right to left. Numerical scales are visible on the vertical axes of each graph. The monitor is positioned against a textured wall, and the right side of the view is partially obscured by a smooth, white, curved surface. An overlay in the bottom-left corner of the screen displays the text \"[2]; gtec medical engineering - Comparing the different approaches of EEG data visualization (2023)\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the shot size transition is confusing; as the camera moves forward causing parts of the monitor to go out of frame, the shot would transition from a full shot to a medium shot or close-up, not remain a full shot. The term \"blurred, curved object\" is imprecise; a more descriptive phrase like \"an out-of-focus silhouette of a person's shoulder\" would better capture this common framing element without speculating. Additionally, the description of the graphs as \"horizontally stacked\" is ambiguous; it would be clearer to state they are arranged in a vertical column, one above the other. The caption also fails to specify if the \"overlay text\" is part of the software displayed on the monitor or a graphic added over the video frame itself. Finally, while the caption notes the waveforms scroll from right to left, it misses an opportunity to describe the visual texture of the movement, such as whether the scrolling is smooth and continuous or if it updates in discrete chunks, which would add more detail to the dynamics of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a computer monitor, which gradually transitions to a close-up as the camera moves forward, causing parts of the monitor to go out of frame. The monitor displays four graphs arranged in a vertical column, each featuring a bright yellow waveform that scrolls smoothly and continuously from right to left. In the bottom-left corner of the screen, overlay text is visible, which appears to be part of the software displayed on the monitor.
