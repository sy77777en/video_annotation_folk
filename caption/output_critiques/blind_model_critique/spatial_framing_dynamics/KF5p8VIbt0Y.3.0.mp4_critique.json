    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a man stands in the bottom center foreground. Directly behind him, a two-story wooden house occupies the center and upper portions of the frame in the middle ground. The entire front facade of the house detaches and falls forward, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. The man remains stationary in the bottom center of the frame as the wall crashes to the ground around him, with the open window frame landing perfectly around his position. The now-exposed interior of the house is visible in the middle ground behind him. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black and white video, a young man wearing dark overalls and a flat cap stands with slight movements in front of a two-story wooden house. The entire front facade of the house, featuring scalloped shingles on the lower half and a window, detaches and falls forward. The man does not move as the wall crashes to the ground around him, leaving him standing perfectly in the open space previously occupied by the window. Behind him, the now-exposed interior of the house is a pile of rubble and debris.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic outdoor setting, a two-story wooden house with a gabled roof stands in a yard next to another building. The upper level of the house is covered in clapboard siding, while the lower level features scalloped shingles and a decorative trellis pattern. The entire front facade of the house suddenly detaches and collapses forward, breaking apart as it hits the ground. The event leaves the interior of the house exposed, with a man standing safely within the open frame where a window once was.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid and accurate description of the main action, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the environment to create a richer visual account. While the man is correctly placed in the \"bottom center foreground,\" specifying his orientation, such as \"with his back to the camera,\" would add valuable detail. The description of the falling facade is clear, but the aftermath could be more specific; for example, you could mention that the fallen wall creates a new layer of debris in the foreground around the man, and that the window frame itself becomes a foreground element that now encircles him. The caption also misses the opportunity to contextualize the house within the wide shot; mentioning if it is flanked by open land or other structures would better establish the scene's scale. Lastly, the description of the \"now-exposed interior\" is a bit vague; specifying what is visible inside, such as \"two floors of unfurnished rooms,\" would provide a more complete picture of the scene's depth after the wall collapses.",
