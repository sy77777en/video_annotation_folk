    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a man stands in the bottom center foreground. Directly behind him, a two-story wooden house occupies the center and upper portions of the frame in the middle ground. The entire front facade of the house detaches and falls forward, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. The man remains stationary in the bottom center of the frame as the wall crashes to the ground around him, with the open window frame landing perfectly around his position. The now-exposed interior of the house is visible in the middle ground behind him. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a black and white video, a young man wearing dark overalls and a flat cap stands with slight movements in front of a two-story wooden house. The entire front facade of the house, featuring scalloped shingles on the lower half and a window, detaches and falls forward. The man does not move as the wall crashes to the ground around him, leaving him standing perfectly in the open space previously occupied by the window. Behind him, the now-exposed interior of the house is a pile of rubble and debris.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a monochromatic outdoor setting, a two-story wooden house with a gabled roof stands in a yard next to another building. The upper level of the house is covered in clapboard siding, while the lower level features scalloped shingles and a decorative trellis pattern. The entire front facade of the house suddenly detaches and collapses forward, breaking apart as it hits the ground. The event leaves the interior of the house exposed, with a man standing safely within the open frame where a window once was.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all instructions, providing a clear, accurate, and detailed description of the video's spatial framing and dynamics.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the subjects (a man and a house facade), their initial positions, the dramatic action of the facade falling, and the final state of the scene. The description of the window frame landing around the stationary man is a crucial and correctly identified detail.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly begins by identifying the \"wide shot.\"\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It precisely locates the man (\"bottom center foreground\") and the house (\"center and upper portions... in the middle ground\"). It also tracks the movement of the facade (\"from the middle ground toward the foreground\").\n    *   **Dynamics and Movement:** It clearly describes the key action (\"facade of the house detaches and falls forward\") and the subject's lack of movement (\"man remains stationary\"). It also describes the result of the movement (\"crashes to the ground around him,\" \"exposed interior... is visible\").\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly includes the camera's position relative to the subject (\"at the subject's level\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Stylistic Rules:**\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n    *   It is structured as a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the visual and spatial information present in the video.\n    *   It is concise while remaining highly informative.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions, resulting in a description that is both comprehensive and easy to understand. No improvements are needed.",
