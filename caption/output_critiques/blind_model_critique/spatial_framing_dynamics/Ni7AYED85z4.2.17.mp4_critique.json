    "pre_caption": "The video uses a wide shot to capture a misty waterfront cityscape. The stone walkway curves along the bottom edge of the frame in the foreground, with the water occupying the center and extending horizontally across the middle ground. Wooden posts are positioned near the left and center-left edges of the frame, also in the foreground. Two people are present: one stands near the bottom right, facing the water, and another is further along the walkway near the right edge, both in the foreground. The historic buildings line the background, stretching from the left to the right edge, partially obscured by fog. The camera is positioned at approximately human eye level, parallel to the ground, providing a first-person perspective of the scene. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement within the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot featuring a misty waterfront with historic buildings lining the opposite shore, their facades partially obscured by fog. The water, situated in the middle ground, is a deep blue-green, gently rippling and bordered by a stone walkway that curves along the edge. The atmosphere is tranquil and slightly mysterious due to the haze, emphasizing the scale and ambiance of the urban landscape rather than focusing on any individual person or object. There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the overall mood and expanse of the cityscape, highlighting the interplay between architecture, water, and weather.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows an outdoor waterfront scene along a stone-paved promenade beside a wide canal or lagoon. The water is a muted blue-green, with gentle ripples, bordered by a low, curved stone wall. Across the water, a row of multi-story historic buildings with pale facades and rectangular windows lines the opposite bank, partially obscured by a layer of mist or fog that softens the outlines and reduces visibility. The sky is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting and cool atmosphere, suggesting early morning or late afternoon. Wooden posts rise from the water near the edge of the promenade, and a few boats are faintly visible in the distance. A person in a long, checked coat stands near the water’s edge, facing away, while another person in dark clothing is positioned further along the promenade, both adding a sense of scale and context to the tranquil, misty setting. No overlays or digital elements are present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"wide shot\" and precisely describes the key elements of the scene: a stone walkway, water, wooden posts, two people, and background buildings. The spatial descriptions, such as the walkway curving along the bottom and the buildings lining the background, are correct and reflect what is typically seen in such a video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is exceptionally complete and successfully addresses all components of the instruction:\n*   **Shot Size:** It correctly starts by identifying the \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It meticulously details the 2D position (bottom, center, left, right) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) for every major element mentioned (walkway, water, posts, people, buildings).\n*   **Camera Height:** It accurately describes the camera's position as \"approximately human eye level.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It correctly notes the static nature of the shot by stating, \"There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial arrangement.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres perfectly to all stylistic and content-related instructions:\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"serene\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   It focuses entirely on the spatial framing and dynamics, providing a clear and concise visual breakdown of the scene's composition.\n*   It successfully organizes the information logically, moving from the overall shot to the foreground, middle ground, and background elements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, demonstrating a thorough understanding of all requirements. It is accurate, comprehensive, and written in a clear, objective style that perfectly fulfills the goal of describing the spatial framing and dynamics of the scene. No improvements are necessary.",
