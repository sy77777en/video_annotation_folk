    "pre_caption": "In this close-up shot, a hippopotamus is visible with its head and upper back above the water. Positioned slightly left of center in the middle ground, the hippo moves slowly towards the right side of the frame, maintaining a relatively central horizontal position. The water occupies the majority of the frame, extending from the foreground to the middle ground. In the background, at the top of the frame, a river bank with vegetation is visible. The camera remains at the hippo's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a hippopotamus partially submerged in water. The hippo's head is partially visible above the surface, displaying smooth, dark brown skin. Its eyes and ears are prominent, positioned high on the head, which is typical for a hippo, allowing it to remain mostly underwater while still observing its surroundings. The water around the hippo is calm, reflecting the animal's stillness and suggesting it is either resting or slowly moving through the water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video shows an outdoor scene centered on a body of calm, murky water, likely a river. The water reflects the light, creating a slightly hazy appearance. Along the far bank, some green, grassy vegetation is visible. A hippopotamus is partially submerged in the water, with only its head and the top of its back visible. It is moving through the water, creating a gentle wake. The time of day appears to be daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but contains one specific inaccuracy regarding the description of the subject's movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the shot size as a \"close-up,\" the subject as a hippopotamus, and the visible parts (\"head and upper back\"). It accurately places the hippo in the middle ground and describes the water (foreground to middle ground) and river bank (background, top of the frame) correctly.\n*   **Inaccuracy:** The phrase \"maintaining a relatively central horizontal position\" is incorrect. The hippo starts left of center and moves *horizontally* toward the right; it does not maintain a central horizontal position. It does, however, maintain a central *vertical* position within the frame. A more accurate description would be: \"...moves slowly towards the right side of the frame, maintaining its position in the vertical center of the shot.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is very complete and successfully addresses all the requirements of the instructions. It includes the shot size, the 2D and 3D positions of the main subject and other key elements, the camera's height relative to the subject, and the spatial dynamics (the hippo's movement).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption perfectly follows the given constraints. It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculation, and ambiguity. It follows the specified structure by starting with the shot size and then describing the spatial arrangement and movement.",
