    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a close-up shot of tall, dry grass filling the frame, obscuring any initial view of the subject. As the scene progresses, the shot transitions into a medium shot, revealing a person from the waist down. The subject is positioned in the center of the frame, with their legs and lower torso visible. The person is standing in the middle ground, surrounded by dense, tall reeds that dominate the foreground and background. The reeds are primarily located in the top and sides of the frame, while the person's legs and boots occupy the central area. The camera remains at the subject's level, capturing the movement of the person walking forward through the reeds. The subject's feet and boots are consistently in the bottom center of the frame, emphasizing their interaction with the ground covered in dry stalks. There are no significant changes in the camera's height or angle, maintaining a consistent perspective focused on the subject's lower body and the surrounding reeds.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a person standing in a field of tall, dry grass. The individual is wearing a brown jacket and beige pants, complemented by dark green rubber boots. The person is facing away, with their lower body visible among the dense grass, which is a prominent feature throughout the scene. The video begins with the view initially obscured by the tall grass, gradually revealing the subject as the camera or subject moves, focusing on the interaction between the person and the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a dense, dry field of tall, golden-brown reeds. The time of day appears to be during daylight, with sunlight casting a warm glow over the scene. The ground is covered with dry, broken stalks, adding a textured layer to the earth. The reeds are slender and vertical, creating a natural barrier that fills the environment. A person is present, wearing green boots and beige clothing, standing amidst the reeds, which suggests a sense of exploration or movement through the field. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with the earthy tones of the reeds dominating the visual palette.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It successfully meets all the requirements of the instruction by providing a detailed and accurate spatial analysis of the video.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. It correctly uses technical terms like \"close-up shot,\" \"medium shot,\" \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" and \"background\" to define the spatial relationships between the subject and the environment. The description of the subject's movement (\"walking forward\") and the camera's perspective is clear and precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It addresses every point from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It clearly states the initial \"close-up\" and the transition to a \"medium shot.\"\n    *   **Position:** It details the subject's 2D position (\"center,\" \"bottom center\") and 3D position (\"middle ground\"), as well as the position of the reeds (2D: \"top and sides\"; 3D: \"foreground and background\").\n    *   **Camera Height:** It specifies the camera is \"at the subject's level.\"\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It effectively describes the initial reveal of the subject from behind the grass and the continuous forward motion, while noting the camera's stability.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the negative and positive constraints perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., it uses \"dry grass,\" a physical descriptor, not \"sad grass\").\n    *   It avoids speculation, sticking only to what is visibly described.\n    *   It follows the requested structure by starting with the shot size, describing the positions of elements, and detailing any changes or movements.\n    *   The description of the subject being revealed from behind the grass is an excellent example of describing a dynamic transition as requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass filling the frame, initially obscuring the subject. As the scene unfolds, the shot transitions to a medium shot, revealing a person from the waist down, centrally positioned in the frame. The subject stands in the middle ground, surrounded by dense, tall reeds that dominate both the foreground and background. The reeds are primarily located at the top and sides of the frame, while the person's legs and boots occupy the central area. The camera remains level with the subject, capturing their movement as they walk forward through the reeds. The subject's feet and boots consistently appear in the bottom center of the frame, highlighting their interaction with the ground covered in dry stalks. The camera maintains a consistent height and angle, focusing on the subject's lower body and the surrounding reeds.",
