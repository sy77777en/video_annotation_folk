    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, while a large fire occupies the left foreground. The man, initially shown in profile facing the left side of the frame, slowly turns his head to face forward toward the camera. The camera remains stationary at the man's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, disheveled hair is shown in heavy silhouette against a large, bright fire. The flickering flames, positioned to his left, create a warm, orange-red rim light along his profile and the back of his head, while his face and front remain in deep shadow. He is wearing dark clothing, the details of which are obscured. Initially seen from the side, he slowly turns to face forward, his features remaining hidden in the darkness.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark setting at night, a person is silhouetted against a large, flickering fire. The bright orange and yellow flames on the left provide the primary illumination, casting the individual's features into deep shadow while creating a warm, glowing outline on their profile and hair. The surrounding environment is obscured in darkness. The person slowly turns their head toward the front as the fire continues to burn.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their basic positions, but it misses a crucial spatial dynamic created by the lighting. Since the fire is in the left middle ground and the man is in the right foreground, the firelight would illuminate the left side of his face and body. The caption fails to mention this key visual link that connects the two elements across the frame and defines their relationship in the 3D space. Additionally, \"close-up shot\" is slightly ambiguous; if the man's shoulders are visible, \"medium close-up\" would be more precise. The description of the man's turn is functional but could be more dynamic by describing the path of his gaze as it shifts from the fire on the left, across the frame, and toward the camera. Finally, mentioning the nature of the background, such as a dark, out-of-focus wall, would provide a more complete sense of depth by establishing a distinct background plane behind the man and the fire.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium close-up shot, a man is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the foreground, while a large fire occupies the left middle ground. The firelight casts a warm glow on the left side of his face and body, creating a visual link between the two elements. Initially shown in profile facing the left side of the frame, the man slowly turns his head, his gaze shifting from the fire, across the frame, and toward the camera. The camera remains stationary at the man's level throughout the shot. The background features a dark, out-of-focus wall, adding depth and establishing a distinct plane behind the man and the fire.",
