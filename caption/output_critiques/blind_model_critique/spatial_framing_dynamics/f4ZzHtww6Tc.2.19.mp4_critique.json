    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot of a skateboarder in the top-center foreground, captured mid-air above a marble ledge in the right foreground. A building is visible in the left background. As the skateboarder lands, the frame tightens to a close-up, with his lower body and skateboard occupying the center foreground. The shot then transitions to a wide shot as the skateboarder moves from the center foreground toward the right middle ground, riding down a street that stretches into the background. The final composition shows the wide street in the center, with buildings on the left, and a van parked in the right middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with light skin and tattoos on both arms is shown skateboarding. He wears a forward-facing black baseball cap, a short-sleeved, light-colored shirt, and dark, baggy cuffed jeans. On his feet are black and white high-top sneakers. He performs a trick, jumping with his dark skateboard onto a low ledge, and then lands back on the board on the pavement to ride away.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A low-angle, fisheye perspective captures an outdoor urban scene during the day. The setting is a city street lined with tall, modern buildings and green, leafy trees. One building features a large, polished marble or stone wall and ledge next to a concrete sidewalk. The camera follows a skateboarder from the sidewalk onto the asphalt street, where a dark-colored van is parked. The wide-angle lens creates a distorted, curved view of the architecture and the street stretching into the distance.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing (shot size) is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should emphasize this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the assumption that the video shows a common skate-line edit. The caption accurately outlines the sequence of shots, but it could be more precise about the transitions and camera dynamics. The phrase \"the frame transitions\" is ambiguous; specifying if it's a hard cut to the medium shot would be clearer, as is typical for emphasizing a landing. Similarly, the transition to the wide shot is likely another hard cut, which should be stated. For the final wide shot, the caption describes the skater's movement but not the camera's action. It would be more informative to state if the camera is static, allowing the skater to ride out of the frame, or if it pans to follow him. The initial low-angle is well-noted, but the camera height for the subsequent medium and wide shots is omitted; the medium shot is likely still low to focus on the feet, while the wide shot might be at a more standard, eye-level height. Finally, describing the skater's movement in relation to the static elements in the final shot—for example, \"riding past the van\"—would better integrate the subject's action with the environment rather than just listing the scene's components.",
