    "pre_caption": "This video features a medium shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. She is on a dirt path, visible at the bottom of the frame, which is flanked by trees and foliage in the background on the left and right. Throughout the clip, the woman remains centrally framed as she leans forward and down to pull a t-shirt over her head. The camera maintains a stable, eye-level perspective with a slight handheld shake, keeping her as the consistent focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A plus-size woman with light skin and dark, wet, curly hair pulled back in a ponytail is shown from the chest up. She is wearing a white bikini top and appears out of breath, with a flushed face and a focused, strained expression. She struggles to pull a light-colored, short-sleeved t-shirt over her head and down her torso, over the bikini top.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The setting is an unpaved dirt path during the daytime, flanked by dense green trees and foliage. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting a soft light on the scene. A woman in a white bikini top is on the path, putting on a light-colored t-shirt. The video has a muted, warm color palette, giving it a slightly faded appearance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the initial scene but overlooks several key spatial dynamics that occur during the action. While it states the woman \"remains centrally framed,\" it fails to mention that as she leans forward, the shot transitions from a medium shot to a medium close-up, bringing her head and shoulders to dominate the frame. The description of her movement is also incomplete; in addition to leaning forward, she moves from the vertical center towards the bottom of the frame, a significant shift in composition that is not described. Furthermore, the claim of a consistent \"eye-level perspective\" is inaccurate; as she bends down, the camera maintains its height, creating a high-angle view looking down on her head and back. The spatial depth could also be more precise, as the dirt path occupies the immediate foreground while the woman stands slightly further back in the shallow middle ground, not strictly in the foreground. Finally, the caption misses the visual obstruction caused by the action, as the t-shirt completely covers her head and upper torso for a moment, temporarily changing the subject from the woman to the fabric itself.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot of a woman positioned in the center of the frame, standing on a dirt path that occupies the immediate foreground. The path is flanked by trees and foliage in the background on both sides. As the woman leans forward to pull a t-shirt over her head, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, with her head and shoulders dominating the frame. During this movement, she shifts from the vertical center towards the bottom of the frame, altering the composition significantly. The camera maintains its height, resulting in a high-angle view looking down on her head and back as she bends. At one point, the t-shirt completely covers her head and upper torso, temporarily shifting the focus from the woman to the fabric itself. Throughout the clip, the camera maintains a slight handheld shake, keeping the dynamic action as the focal point.",
