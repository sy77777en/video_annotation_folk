    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide shot of a nighttime landscape, with no specific subjects. The scene is framed with a thin line of distant city lights positioned along the bottom of the frame in the background. Above this, a vast, dark storm cloud occupies the majority of the frame, stretching from the left edge across the center and top. A small area of clearer sky is visible in the bottom right, just above the horizon. Suddenly, a powerful lightning strike occurs within the cloud, primarily illuminating the upper left and central portions of the frame. This flash reveals the turbulent, purple interior of the cloud and a bright, branching lightning bolt in the upper left before the scene returns to darkness. The camera remains static and is positioned at a low height, looking across the flat terrain towards the immense sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at night. The focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the weather event rather than a specific subject. The scene is set against a dark, flat horizon punctuated by the distant, twinkling lights of a city. Above, a vast and ominous storm cloud, initially cloaked in darkness, is suddenly and spectacularly illuminated from within by several massive lightning strikes, causing a large portion of the sky to erupt in a brilliant, glowing purple. Within this vibrant luminescence, the turbulent, streaked texture of the cloud becomes visible, along with the bright, branching form of the lightning bolts themselves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **At night, a vast, dark storm cloud looms over a distant city skyline, separated from the sky by a thin line of glowing lights on the horizon. To the right, a small patch of clearer, dark blue sky is visible. Several sudden, powerful flashes of lightning occur within the massive cloud, illuminating it from the inside with a brilliant white glow. The brief flashes reveal the turbulent, purple-textured interior of the storm before the scene returns to darkness.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the extreme wide shot and the general placement of the city lights and storm cloud, it could be more precise about the nature of the lightning and its effect on the scene. The description of \"powerful lightning strikes\" followed by \"a bright, branching lightning bolt\" is slightly contradictory; the video actually shows a rapid series of interconnected \"crawler\" lightning flashes that spread horizontally across the cloud's interior, not a single, distinct bolt. Furthermore, the caption states the flash \"reveals the turbulent, purple interior,\" but it understates the dynamism of this moment; the lightning doesn't just illuminate the cloud but makes the entire formation appear to boil and churn with violent energy for a brief second. The description of the camera's slow pan to the right is correct, but it misses the compositional shift this causes, as the area of clearer sky in the bottom right gradually expands, and the central mass of the storm cloud drifts slightly toward the left of the frame. Finally, the depth could be described with more nuance; the lightning flash creates a momentary, dramatic sense of deep, three-dimensional layers within the cloud, contrasting with its initial appearance as a flat, dark silhouette.",
