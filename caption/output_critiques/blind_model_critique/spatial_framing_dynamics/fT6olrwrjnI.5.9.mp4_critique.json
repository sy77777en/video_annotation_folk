    "pre_caption": "A medium shot centers on an animated character positioned in the middle ground of the frame. He leans forward, occupying the center of the composition. Red, vein-like energy surrounds the character, with some tendrils extending into the foreground and others wrapping around him in the middle ground against a plain, light-colored background. The camera is positioned slightly below the character, looking up at him, and executes a subtle, slow push-in throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video showcases an animated figure wearing a black and white striped sports jersey with the number 18. He has short, dark hair and a determined expression. His eyes are glowing red, and red, vein-like energy surrounds him, highlighting his intense focus and power. The character is depicted in motion, possibly running or charging forward, with his fists clenched and arms bent.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an intense scene featuring a character in a dynamic pose, set against a stark, minimalistic background. The environment is undefined, with a focus on the character who is wearing a black and white sports uniform with the number 18. Red, lightning-like energy surrounds the character, adding a sense of motion and intensity. The character's expression and posture suggest action, with the red energy providing a vivid contrast to the otherwise monochrome setting. The scene is captured from an objective point of view, emphasizing the character's centrality and the dramatic visual elements.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Shot Size and Subject:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as a medium shot that centers on the animated character.\n*   **Position and Depth:** It accurately places the character in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The description of the red energy is particularly strong, correctly noting how some tendrils extend into the foreground while others remain in the middle ground with the character, which effectively describes the scene's depth.\n*   **Camera Angle and Movement:** The caption correctly identifies the camera's position as slightly below the character (a low angle) and accurately describes the subtle, slow push-in movement that occurs throughout the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the required elements: shot size, 2D position (center), 3D position (foreground, middle ground, background), camera height (below the subject), and spatial dynamics (camera push-in).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is efficient, packing a lot of accurate spatial information into a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **Neutral Language:** It uses simple, objective language (\"red, vein-like energy,\" \"plain, light-colored background\") and avoids emotional or speculative terms.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It provides a precise and detailed analysis of the video's spatial framing and dynamics without any unnecessary information.",
