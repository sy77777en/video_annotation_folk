    "pre_caption": "A medium shot centrally frames an astronaut from the chest up. He is positioned in the middle ground, situated within a complex, multi-dimensional structure of intersecting planes that extend from the foreground to the background, creating a symmetrical and immersive environment. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged man with light skin is shown from the chest up, facing forward. He is wearing a white and black spacesuit with a circular blue NASA patch in the center of his chest and a rectangular black name tag that reads \"COOPER\" on the left side. He wears a matching helmet with a clear visor, through which his face is visible, showing an expression of intense concentration.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An astronaut in a white spacesuit is positioned in the center of a vast, dimly lit, and complex interior space. This environment is a multi-dimensional grid composed of countless intersecting planes and corridors that stretch into the distance in all directions, creating an infinite lattice-like effect. The spacesuit, marked with a circular blue NASA logo and the name \"COOPER\" on a patch, contrasts with the dark, predominantly brown and black surroundings. The lighting is low, casting deep shadows and highlighting the intricate geometry of the abstract structure.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the medium shot and the astronaut's central position, but it lacks specificity regarding the dynamics and texture of the environment. The description of the \"complex, multi-dimensional structure\" is too abstract; it could detail whether the \"intersecting planes\" are solid, translucent, or made of light, and if they are static or in motion, such as slowly rotating or pulsing with energy, which would be a key spatial dynamic. The caption also misses the astronaut's own subtle actions; for instance, he might be slowly turning his head to scan the environment or his gloved hands could be manipulating a control panel just below the frame, adding a layer of interaction with his surroundings. Furthermore, describing him as simply in the \"foreground\" might be inaccurate if parts of the structure are also in the immediate foreground, framing him and creating a more layered depth of field. The assertion of a \"symmetrical\" environment could be an oversimplification, as there might be asymmetrical elements like a floating piece of debris on the left or a flickering light on a background plane to the right that break the perfect symmetry and guide the viewer's eye.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot centrally frames an astronaut from the chest up, positioned in the middle ground within a dynamic, multi-dimensional structure. The intersecting planes, made of translucent material, pulse gently with energy, creating an immersive environment that extends from the foreground to the background. The camera remains static at the subject's level, capturing the astronaut as he slowly turns his head to scan the surroundings, while his gloved hands subtly manipulate a control panel just below the frame. The environment is rich with depth, as parts of the structure also occupy the immediate foreground, framing the astronaut. Asymmetrical elements, such as a floating piece of debris on the left and a flickering light on a background plane to the right, break the symmetry and guide the viewer's eye through the scene.",
