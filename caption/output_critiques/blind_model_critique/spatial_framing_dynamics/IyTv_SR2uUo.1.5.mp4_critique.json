    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot from a point-of-view perspective inside a shopping cart, the red wire frame of the cart occupies the foreground, framing the bottom and sides of the scene. A young boy is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground, pushing the cart. In the foreground, a bag of chips rests inside the cart at the bottom right. On the left and right, tall grocery shelves are in the middle ground and extend into the background, moving past the camera as the cart is pushed forward. The camera is positioned at the boy's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young boy with light brown skin, short dark brown hair, and dark eyes is pushing a red metal shopping cart. He is wearing a light green short-sleeved t-shirt and dark shorts with a white pattern. He holds onto the top front bar of the cart with both hands and looks up and to his right. Inside the cart is a large purple bag of chips with a yellow cartoon character on the front.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a locked-on POV shot mounted inside a red, wire-frame shopping cart, the camera moves forward through a brightly lit aisle of a grocery store. White ceilings with rectangular fluorescent lights illuminate the scene. On either side, tall shelves are fully stocked with various packaged goods in bags and jars. A young boy, leaning forward and holding onto the front of the red cart, looks up to his right while the shelves of products pass by. Inside the cart with the camera, a large purple bag of chips rests against the side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of a \"locked-on perspective\" that also \"pans right\" is contradictory; a locked-on camera moves with the object it's attached to, so the caption should instead specify that the entire cart is turning right, causing the view to pivot. Furthermore, from a perspective inside the cart looking out, the cart's handlebar would be a prominent framing element at the top of the frame, which the caption omits. Including the handlebar would also provide a reference point for the boy's hands and better contextualize his action of pushing. The spatial relationship between the foreground and middle ground could be more precise; for instance, the boy in the middle ground is seen *through* the foreground wire frame of the cart, a detail that would add more depth. Finally, while the boy is correctly placed in the center, the bag of chips is described as being at the \"bottom right,\" but it's possible other items are also in the cart, and their collective arrangement in the foreground could be described more comprehensively to give a fuller picture of the immediate space.",
