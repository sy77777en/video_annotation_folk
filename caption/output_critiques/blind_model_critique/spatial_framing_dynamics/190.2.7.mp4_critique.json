    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of three men seated inside a car. The camera captures them from the front, at their eye level. The man on the left occupies the bottom left portion of the frame, positioned in the foreground. The man in the middle is centered, also in the foreground, while the man on the right sits slightly to the right, occupying the bottom right area of the frame. All three are in the foreground, with the car's interior forming the middle ground. The background outside the car is blurred, suggesting a tree-lined street. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial position throughout the sequence. The camera remains static, maintaining a consistent view of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features three men seated inside a car. The man on the left has a medium skin tone, is wearing a dark hat, and a dark jacket. The man in the middle, with a lighter skin tone, is wearing a light-colored hat and a beige jacket over a green shirt. The man on the right, with a deep brown complexion, is wearing a dark hat and a dark jacket. All three men are facing forward, with the man on the right positioned as the driver. The scene conveys a sense of focus and engagement among the men.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a car, viewed from an objective perspective. The scene takes place during the day, as indicated by the natural light filtering through the windows. The car's interior features a rearview mirror and windshield wiper, with three individuals seated inside. The upholstery appears to be dark, complementing the overall muted color scheme. Outside the car, blurred elements suggest a tree-lined street. Overlay text is present, displaying a quote: \"We were just doing it to show off.\" - Spike Lee, prominently placed across the scene.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the basic shot size and depth layers but lacks precision regarding the subjects' specific arrangement and the scene's dynamics. It should specify the individual positions of the men within the frame—for example, a driver on the left, a passenger on the right, and a third man in the center but positioned in the back seat. This detail is crucial as it also clarifies the relative depth between the subjects, with the man in the back being further from the camera than the two in the front, a nuance missed by grouping them all in the \"midground.\" Most importantly, the statement \"no significant changes\" is likely incorrect; a blurred background of a \"tree-lined street\" implies the car is moving. The caption should describe this key dynamic, noting that while the subjects and camera are static relative to each other, the background elements are in constant horizontal motion, creating a dynamic contrast.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a medium shot of three men inside a car. The camera captures them from the front at eye level. The man on the left is the driver, occupying the bottom left portion of the frame in the foreground. The man in the middle is seated in the back seat, centered in the frame, and positioned further from the camera, indicating greater depth. The man on the right is the front passenger, occupying the bottom right area of the frame in the foreground. The car's interior forms the middle ground, while the blurred background suggests a tree-lined street, indicating the car is in motion. This movement creates a dynamic contrast, as the subjects and camera remain static relative to each other, while the background elements move horizontally.",
