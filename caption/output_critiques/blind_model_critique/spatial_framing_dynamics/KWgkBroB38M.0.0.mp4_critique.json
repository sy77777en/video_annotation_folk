    "pre_caption": "This close-up video begins from a high angle, showing a person's hands in the bottom left foreground holding a square infinity mirror that occupies the center of the frame. To the right of the mirror, in the middle ground, a black power adapter rests on a white tabletop. The camera then zooms in, pushing the hands and adapter out of view until the infinity mirror fills the entire frame, creating a centered, direct view into the illusion of receding cyan squares.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person's hands, emerging from the sleeves of a dark jacket, are shown with a lit-up thin object. The object has a black frame and emits a bright cyan glow from an internal light source, creating a tunnel-like illusion of infinitely receding, nested squares. Lying on the white surface next to the object is a black, rectangular AC/DC power adapter with a label.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Indoors, on a white tabletop, a person handles a square, black-framed object. The device illuminates to reveal an infinity mirror effect. Glowing cyan-colored squares appear to recede into the distance, creating the illusion of a deep, luminous tunnel. The power adapter and its coiled black cable lie on the table beside the lit mirror.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (hands, infinity mirror, power adapter), their properties (square mirror, black adapter), and their actions/states (hands holding, adapter resting). The description of the visual effect within the mirror (\"receding cyan squares\") is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:** The caption successfully incorporates all the required elements from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the initial shot as a \"close-up.\"\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** It masterfully describes the position and depth of each element: \"hands in the bottom left foreground,\" \"mirror that occupies the center,\" and \"adapter... to the right... in the middle ground.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly notes the initial \"high angle\" of the camera.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics/Changes:** It clearly explains the camera movement (\"zooms in\") and the consequences for the framing: \"pushing the hands and adapter out of view\" until the \"mirror fills the entire frame.\" It also accurately describes the final state as a \"centered, direct view.\"\n    *   **Style and Tone:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional adjectives and speculative phrases, focusing purely on the visual and spatial facts as instructed. It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a perfect execution of the instructions. It is detailed without being verbose, and it precisely describes the spatial composition and dynamic changes within the video frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This close-up video starts from a high angle, capturing a person's hands in the bottom left foreground holding a square infinity mirror at the center of the frame. To the right of the mirror, a black power adapter rests on a white tabletop in the middle ground. The camera then zooms in, gradually moving the hands and adapter out of view until the infinity mirror fills the entire frame, offering a centered, direct view into the illusion of receding cyan squares.",
