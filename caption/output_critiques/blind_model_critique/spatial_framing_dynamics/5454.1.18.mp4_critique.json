    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a low-angle wide shot, featuring a man positioned in the center of the frame, in the middle ground, on a balcony. The dark, perforated metal railing of the balcony is in the foreground relative to the man. The angular, grey concrete building occupies the background, with an overhanging section at the top of the frame. A bright, circular light fixture is visible on the top right, attached to the underside of the building's upper level, in the middle ground, while the overcast sky forms the upper background. The camera then swiftly tilts downwards, transitioning to show a blurred group of people on a lower balcony, now occupying the lower portion of the frame in the middle ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark skin and short, dark hair is featured on a balcony, looking downwards. He wears a dark jacket with extensive white lettering and designs, including \"OWN YOUR ASSET\" on his right chest, and \"NEVER FORGET YOUR GRACEFUL LEGACY\" on his left chest and sleeves. Underneath the open jacket, a white crew-neck shirt is visible. He also wears dark pants and dark gloves, leaning forward with his hands resting on the dark metal, perforated railing of the balcony. Subsequently, the viewpoint shifts to reveal a group of people situated on the ground below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene, captured from an objective point of view, presents a low-angle perspective of a person on a balcony of a multi-story building under an overcast, grey sky. The building features angular, grey concrete construction with a flat roof and overhanging sections. The balcony is enclosed by a dark, perforated metal railing. A single, bright, circular light fixture is visible on the underside of the building's upper level. The camera then swiftly tilts downward, revealing a blurred view of a group of people standing on the lower floor's balcony.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of a man standing on a balcony, captured from a low angle. The camera swiftly tilts down to reveal a group of people below\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key elements and the camera movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships, particularly during and after the camera tilt. While \"wide shot\" is plausible, if the man is clearly the central subject and visible from head to toe, \"full shot\" might be a more accurate descriptor of his framing within the wider architectural context. The description of the downward tilt is good, but it omits what happens to the initial foreground element; if the camera is positioned on its own balcony, the railing in the immediate foreground would likely remain a constant, out-of-focus element at the very bottom of the frame throughout the entire shot, which is a key detail for spatial anchoring. Furthermore, the final composition is described vaguely; after the tilt, the caption should specify what fills the rest of the frame besides the blurred group in the \"lower portion.\" For instance, the concrete facade of the building might now dominate the upper two-thirds of the frame, providing a more complete picture of the final framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a low-angle full shot, featuring a man positioned centrally in the frame, standing on a balcony. The dark, perforated metal railing of the balcony is in the immediate foreground, slightly out of focus, and remains a constant element at the bottom of the frame throughout the shot. The angular, grey concrete building occupies the background, with an overhanging section at the top of the frame. A bright, circular light fixture is visible on the top right, attached to the underside of the building's upper level, in the middle ground, while the overcast sky forms the upper background.
