    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a full shot of a leopard positioned in the right middle ground on a dirt and grass slope. A dense thicket of green bushes and tall grass occupies the background and the left side of the frame. The leopard moves diagonally from the right towards the bottom left, entering the foreground. It continues walking until it is completely obscured by the foliage at the bottom left, disappearing from the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A leopard with a tan coat covered in black rosettes is seen walking on a slight incline of dry grass and reddish dirt. The large cat has a muscular build and a long tail that curls up, revealing the white underside. It moves cautiously from the right side of the frame, heading towards the bottom left. The leopard continues walking until it is completely obscured by the foliage and disappears from view.\n\n**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a sunlit, natural landscape, a leopard moves down a gentle slope of reddish-brown earth mixed with dry, yellowed grass. A dense thicket of green bushes and taller, straw-colored grasses is situated in the middleground and background. As it proceeds, it lowers its body and disappears from the bottom left, with its tail visible for a moment before it is fully concealed by the foliage.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects disappearing from the frame**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subject. Then the subject disappears.\n\nBefore the subject disappears, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview, but it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the leopard's interaction with its environment. The term \"full shot\" might be inaccurate; if the surrounding landscape is a significant part of the composition, \"wide shot\" would be more appropriate. The initial position \"right middle ground\" is slightly ambiguous; specifying it as the \"top right\" would better indicate its higher position on the slope. The description of the leopard's exit, \"disappears from the frame,\" is too general. A more detailed account would be better, for example, describing if it walks behind a foreground bush in the bottom left, which would add a layer of depth to the scene. Furthermore, the description of the \"dense thicket\" could be more specific about its placement; for instance, it might be more accurate to state that it occupies the left foreground and extends into the background, creating a natural frame. Finally, while the camera is described as being at the \"subject's level,\" it's more likely positioned at a slightly low angle, looking up the slope, which would subtly enhance the leopard's presence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a wide shot of a leopard positioned at the top right of a dirt and grass slope. A dense thicket of green bushes and tall grass occupies the left foreground and extends into the background, creating a natural frame. The leopard moves diagonally from the top right towards the bottom left, entering the foreground. It continues walking until it is partially obscured by a bush in the bottom left, eventually disappearing completely behind the foliage. The camera is positioned at a slightly low angle, looking up the slope, subtly enhancing the leopard's presence.",
