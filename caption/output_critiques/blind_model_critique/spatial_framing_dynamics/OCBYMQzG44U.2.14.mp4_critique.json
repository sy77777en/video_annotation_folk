    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of an indoor pool scene, with no major subjects present. Initially, the camera is positioned low, just above the water level inside an arched, tiled tunnel, which frames the shot from the top, left, and bottom foreground. The green pool water occupies the bottom of the frame. Through the tunnel opening, a brightly lit pool area is visible in the center-right middle ground. The camera then pans to the right, revealing more of the tiled interior wall before settling on a view looking down another, similar tunnel opening on the right side of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures an indoor pool scene featuring white walls and an arched tunnel lined with white square tiles. The soft beige lighting casts a warm glow on the tiles, while the green pool water provides a striking contrast. The camera is positioned inside the arched tunnel, initially facing the brightly lit indoor pool area, then quickly pans right to reveal another tunnel opening. The focus is on creating a tranquil atmosphere within this uniquely constructed pool interior, rather than highlighting a specific subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an indoor pool scene with white walls and an arched tunnel lined with white square tiles. Soft beige lighting casts a warm glow on the tiles, contrasting with the green pool water. The camera is positioned inside the arched tunnel, initially facing the brightly lit pool area, then pans right to reveal another tunnel opening. The focus is on creating a tranquil atmosphere within this uniquely constructed pool interior.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the wide shot, low camera angle, and the rightward pan, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and subject focus. Stating there are \"no major subjects\" is debatable, as the arched tunnels themselves function as the primary architectural subjects. The description of the initial tunnel framing the shot from the \"foreground and middle ground\" is slightly confusing; it would be clearer to state that the tunnel's entrance is in the foreground, with its interior walls receding into the middle ground. As the camera pans right, the caption fails to mention that the \"brightly lit pool area\" at center-left would consequently shift left and exit the frame. Furthermore, the description of the water is static; a more dynamic caption would note if there are gentle ripples on the water's surface, which would be prominent from such a low angle. Finally, the description of the final shot is incomplete, as it only mentions the second tunnel opening in the center but neglects to describe what, if anything, is visible through it, leaving the final composition's depth unresolved.",
