    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle close-up shot filmed from the subject's chest, a man's head is centered in the frame, with his shoulders and torso occupying the bottom foreground. His hands are positioned in the top left and top right corners, framing his head in the foreground. A clear blue sky fills the entire background. A small, dark object is visible in the background, to the right of the center. The man's hands move slightly as he adjusts the goggles on his helmet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with a beard is seen from a worm's eye angle. He is wearing a black helmet with reflective goggles, which he is adjusting by pulling them down over his eyes. He is dressed in a bright yellow jumpsuit with blue and purple accents on the chest. His hands are raised on either side of his head.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a worm's eye perspective looking directly up, a man with a beard is seen against a vast, clear blue sky during the daytime. He is wearing a bright yellow jacket with blue zippered accents and a black helmet with reflective goggles pushed up onto it. His hands are raised on either side of his head, framing his face. The background consists of an uninterrupted expanse of blue, with a small black object seen falling from the sky in the far distance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of a \"worm's eye angle\" is potentially misleading; a shot from the subject's chest pointing up at their own face is more accurately a low-angle or chest-mounted point-of-view shot, not a true worm's eye view from the ground. The use of \"foreground\" for the torso and \"middle ground\" for the head, while technically relative, is slightly awkward for a single subject in a close-up; it would be clearer to describe the chin and neck as being closest to the camera at the bottom of the frame. The description of the hands is static, stating they \"are positioned\" in the corners, whereas the video likely shows them moving into the frame from the bottom or sides to reach the goggles and then possibly retracting, a key spatial dynamic that is missed. Furthermore, the caption states a black object \"is seen falling,\" which lacks detail on its movement; it should specify the object's trajectory, such as if it moves from the top right towards the bottom right of the frame, and whether its size changes, which would indicate a change in depth relative to the subject.",
