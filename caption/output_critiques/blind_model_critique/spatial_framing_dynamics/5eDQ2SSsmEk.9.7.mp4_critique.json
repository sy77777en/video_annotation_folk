    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot focusing on a small portion of the flying vehicle located in the upper-right corner of the frame. This initial segment places the vehicle in the foreground while the rest of the scene remains in the background. As the vehicle descends, the shot size transitions to a full view, capturing the entire vehicle as it moves towards the center of the frame. The vehicle's descent shifts its 2D position from the upper-right to the center, maintaining its foreground placement. The platform on which the vehicle lands occupies the middle ground, extending horizontally across the frame. The surrounding space structures and beams of light are positioned in the background, enhancing the depth of the scene. The camera maintains a position above the vehicle throughout, providing a clear overhead perspective. By the end, the shot size expands to a wide shot, showcasing the vehicle fully landed on the platform, centered in the frame, with the expansive space environment enveloping it from all sides. The camera's consistent overhead angle ensures a comprehensive view of the vehicle's landing process and its final position on the platform.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small portion of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right corner, showing a dark, angular structure with illuminated elements. As the vehicle descends, it becomes fully visible, revealing a sleek, futuristic design with glowing red and blue lights. The vehicle's surface appears metallic and reflective, with distinct geometric shapes. The video concludes with a wide shot of the vehicle resting on the platform, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures, emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts a futuristic, industrial setting viewed from an objective perspective. It takes place in a dimly lit, expansive space, possibly a docking area or a large platform, with a metallic and mechanical aesthetic. The environment is characterized by towering structures and machinery, with beams of light cutting through the darkness, creating a stark contrast. The scene is illuminated by various light sources, including spotlights and glowing red and blue indicators, adding to the high-tech atmosphere. The presence of a vehicle, with sleek, angular design and illuminated elements, suggests movement and activity within this space. The overall ambiance is enhanced by a sense of depth and scale, with scattered particles or stars visible in the background, contributing to the scene's otherworldly feel.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small part of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right part of the frame. As the vehicle descends, it is fully gradually revealed, and the shot ends with a wide shot of the vehicle on the platform.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and its general movement, it mischaracterizes the spatial dynamics and uses imprecise terminology. The initial shot is more accurately a close-up, not a medium shot, as it focuses on only a \"small portion\" of the vehicle. The most significant inaccuracy is the claim that the vehicle \"maintains its foreground placement\" during its descent; as it moves toward the platform in the middle ground, its depth position is actively shifting from the foreground *to* the middle ground, a crucial dynamic that is missed. The description of the shot size change from \"full view\" to \"wide shot\" is redundant and confusing; it would be clearer to describe this as a single, continuous camera movement, such as a dolly out or zoom out, that transitions from a close-up to a final wide shot. Furthermore, the caption describes the camera as being in a static position \"above the vehicle,\" but for the framing to change as described, the camera must be actively moving—likely dollying backward and possibly tilting down to track the vehicle's descent and landing, a key aspect of the shot's dynamic that should be specified.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a close-up shot focusing on a small portion of the flying vehicle in the upper-right corner of the frame. This initial segment places the vehicle prominently in the foreground. As the vehicle descends, the camera executes a smooth dolly out, transitioning from a close-up to a wide shot, capturing the entire vehicle as it moves toward the center of the frame. During its descent, the vehicle shifts from the foreground to the middle ground, aligning with the platform it is approaching. The platform extends horizontally across the frame, occupying the middle ground, while surrounding space structures and beams of light enhance the depth in the background. The camera actively moves, likely dollying backward and tilting down, to maintain a clear overhead perspective of the vehicle's descent and landing. By the end, the wide shot showcases the vehicle fully landed on the platform, centered in the frame, with the expansive space environment enveloping it from all sides. This dynamic camera movement ensures a comprehensive view of the vehicle's landing process and its final position on the platform.",
