    "pre_caption": "A medium close-up shot centers on a man and a woman in the middle ground. Above them, at the top of the frame, hang star-shaped decorations and lights. The background contains out-of-focus lights, with purple lights in the bottom left and a red, heart-shaped light in the top right. The couple slowly rotates clockwise in the center of the frame, and the camera follows their movement, keeping them as the central focus while the perspective on them shifts. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man and a woman are dancing closely and kissing. The woman has long, straight, light-brown hair and is wearing a light-colored, sleeveless top. The man has a large, curly, blonde perm and is wearing a dark-colored suit jacket with a white corsage on the lapel over a light-colored shirt. They are embracing and slowly rotating clockwise in place in a dimly lit environment with colorful party lights.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a dimly lit indoor space during a nighttime celebration. The environment is characterized by soft, colorful lighting, with prominent hues of purple, red, and green creating a hazy ambiance. Hanging from the ceiling are shiny, star-shaped decorations and strings of festive lights, which produce a noticeable bokeh effect. The background is dark and indistinct, keeping the focus on the central area where a couple is dancing closely beneath the decorations.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the core camera and subject movement, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. The \"medium close-up\" designation might be inaccurate; a medium shot, showing the couple from the waist up, seems more likely to comfortably frame their full rotation. The statement that they remain \"centered\" is a generalization; a more detailed description would note how their positions shift within the central third of the frame as they turn, with one person's profile giving way to the other's full face. The spatial layering feels incomplete by only mentioning the middle and background; the shot likely includes an out-of-focus foreground element, such as a railing or foliage at the bottom of the frame, which would create a stronger sense of depth and parallax during the camera's arc. Furthermore, the description of the star-shaped decorations is limited to their 2D position at the top of the frame; specifying their depth, such as being in the foreground closer to the camera, would create a more comprehensive spatial map. Finally, instead of just stating the perspective shifts, the caption could describe the effect of the combined rotation and arc, for example, by explaining that the view transitions from the man's face to the woman's as he turns his back toward the camera.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot captures a man and a woman from the waist up, rotating slowly clockwise in the central third of the frame. As they turn, the camera follows their movement, transitioning the view from the man's face to the woman's as his back faces the camera. Star-shaped decorations and lights hang in the foreground, closer to the camera, adding depth to the scene. The background features out-of-focus lights, with purple hues in the bottom left and a red, heart-shaped light in the top right. An out-of-focus foreground element, such as a railing or foliage, enhances the sense of depth and parallax as the camera arcs around the couple. The spatial dynamics and composition create a layered visual experience, with the couple's positions shifting subtly within the frame.",
