    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a bustling city square populated by numerous people. Initially, a souvenir cart is located in the center-left foreground, with tourists occupying the foreground and middle ground. In the background, a large basilica is visible in the center-left, partially covered by scaffolding, while a long, arched building extends across the right background. The scene then cuts to a wider shot from a different position. In this new framing, a metal railing appears in the left foreground, with the crowd now situated in the middle ground. The basilica is positioned more centrally in the background, with the arched building to its right and another building to its left. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level with the people in the square.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video captures the vibrant diversity of St. Mark's Square in Venice, showcasing a bustling cityscape filled with tourists of various ethnicities. The camera's broad, panning view highlights the grand scale of the historic architecture and the lively atmosphere. On a bright, sunny day, the magnificent facade of St. Mark's Basilica stands in the background, partially obscured by white scaffolding, while the distinctive Gothic architecture of the Doge's Palace extends to the right with its elegant colonnade. The square is teeming with people in colorful and varied styles, some admiring the buildings, others walking through the crowd, and a few gathered around a souvenir cart selling vibrant t-shirts and hats.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a sunny day in St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy, crowds of tourists walk around the open plaza. In the background stands the ornate St. Mark's Basilica, with its domes and detailed facade, a portion of which is covered by white scaffolding. To the right, the long, white colonnade of the Doge's Palace extends along the square. The scene also captures other buildings visible in the left background, adding to the overall view of St. Mark's Square. A souvenir stand selling t-shirts and other trinkets is nestled amidst the pedestrians. The video shows different perspectives of the bustling square, filled with people under a clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main elements and the wide shot, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics created by the camera's movement. The description of the camera trucking right while panning left is a good start, but it fails to explain the purpose of this combined motion; for instance, it could be specified that the pan keeps the central basilica framed on the left as the camera moves. The description of the zoom as \"initially zooming in and finally zooming out\" is vague; a more accurate description might be that the camera performs a slow, continuous zoom-in during the first half of the shot to focus on the activity around the souvenir cart, followed by a zoom-out in the second half. Furthermore, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the parallax effect, where the foreground tourists appear to move rapidly across the frame from right to left, while the middle-ground cart shifts more slowly, and the background basilica remains relatively stable. The movement of the people is described generically; it could be improved by noting the dominant flow of foot traffic, such as crowds moving from left to right across the foreground, which would create a dynamic counter-movement to the camera's truck. Finally, the caption omits the camera's height, which appears to be positioned slightly above eye-level, allowing for a clear view over the heads of the people in the immediate foreground.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a bustling city square with a dynamic interplay of camera movements and spatial elements. Initially, the camera trucks right while panning left, maintaining the large basilica framed on the left as it moves. The scene opens with a slow, continuous zoom-in focusing on the activity around a souvenir cart in the center-left foreground, surrounded by tourists. In the background, the basilica is partially covered by scaffolding, with a long, arched building extending across the right. The camera then zooms out, revealing a wider perspective. A metal railing appears in the left foreground, and the crowd shifts to the middle ground. The basilica is now more centrally positioned, flanked by the arched building on the right and another structure on the left. The parallax effect is evident as foreground tourists move rapidly from right to left, the cart shifts more slowly, and the basilica remains stable. The dominant flow of foot traffic moves from left to right across the foreground, creating a dynamic counter-movement to the camera's truck. The camera is positioned slightly above eye-level, providing a clear view over the heads of the people in the immediate foreground.",
