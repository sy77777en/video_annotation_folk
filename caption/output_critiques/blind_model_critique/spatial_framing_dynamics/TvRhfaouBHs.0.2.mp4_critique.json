    "pre_caption": "This close-up, high-angle shot shows a white sheet of paper positioned centrally in the foreground, resting on a dark brown wooden surface in the background. The paper, which fills most of the frame, has the text \"WRITING SECTION\" at the top center and the question \"What is the meaning of life?\" below it. A finger holds the paper at the bottom right corner of the frame. To the right, a partial illustration of a DNA helix is visible on a second sheet of paper tucked underneath the top one. The entire composition remains static throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A white sheet of paper rests on a dark brown wooden surface, held at the bottom right corner by a light-skinned finger with a short, clean nail. The paper features the heading \"WRITING SECTION\" in a black, capitalized, serif font. Below the heading is the question, \"What is the meaning of life?\", followed by two blank horizontal lines. Beneath this paper, a separate sheet displays a partial, stylized illustration of a DNA double helix with cross-hatching.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, shows a white sheet of paper held over a dark brown wooden surface. At the top of the paper, the heading \"WRITING SECTION\" is printed in bold, capital letters. Below it, the question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is written, followed by two blank lines. A small, black-and-white illustration resembling a DNA helix is visible on a sheet of paper beneath the top page, next to a finger holding the paper in place.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and the initial setup, its description of spatial relationships and movement could be more precise. The term \"high-angle\" might be less accurate than \"overhead shot\" if the camera is positioned directly above the paper. Using \"foreground\" for the paper and \"background\" for the table is confusing in a flat-lay context; it would be clearer to state the paper is positioned centrally *on* the wooden surface. The description of the camera movement is too vague; instead of \"zooms in... focusing more closely,\" it should specify the final shot size (e.g., an extreme close-up) and what elements are centered or emphasized in the final frame, such as the question and the DNA helix. Additionally, the caption fails to mention if the finger at the bottom right remains in the shot or moves out of frame during the zoom, which is a significant change to the composition. Finally, objective details like whether the text is handwritten or typed could be included to provide a more complete visual account.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This overhead shot captures a white sheet of paper positioned centrally on a dark brown wooden surface. The paper, which dominates the frame, features the typed text \"WRITING SECTION\" at the top center and the question \"What is the meaning of life?\" below it. A finger holds the paper at the bottom right corner, remaining in the frame throughout. To the right, a partial illustration of a DNA helix is visible on a second sheet of paper tucked underneath. The camera gradually zooms in to an extreme close-up, emphasizing the question and the DNA helix, while the finger stays in the shot, maintaining the composition.",
