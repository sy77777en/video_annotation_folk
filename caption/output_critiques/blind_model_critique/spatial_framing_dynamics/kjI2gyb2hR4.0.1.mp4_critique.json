    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the background, shelves line the top and left of the frame. A vintage television is visible in the middle ground on the bottom left, while a boombox sits in the middle ground on the right. As the man speaks, he leans forward, moving from the middle ground toward the foreground. The shot simultaneously tightens to a medium close-up, emphasizing his movement and expression. The camera remains positioned at the subject's level throughout the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A middle-aged, heavy-set man with fair skin and grey, thinning hair is shown in a medium shot that transitions to a medium close-up. He has a full, white beard that appears to be a prop, covering his chin and jawline. He wears a white collared shirt under a brown vest. Pushed up on his forehead is a pair of dark, steampunk-style goggles with metallic rims; a small, complex mechanical device is attached to one of the lenses. His expression predominantly remains serious and intense, with subtle eyebrow movements and moments when his eyes open wide as he looks forward and speaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is set in a dimly lit room with a noticeable green tint. The background is filled with shelves cluttered with boxes and miscellaneous items. On a lower shelf to the left sits a small, vintage television, while a boombox is visible on a counter to the right, contributing to the appearance of a workshop or storage area.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the initial medium shot, the central foreground position of the man, and the transition to a medium close-up via a zoom. However, it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and dynamics. The description of the shelves as lining the 'top, left, and right sides' is vague; it would be clearer to state if they are part of a single shelving unit that frames the subject and to mention their contents, such as books or records, which would add context to the scene's depth. While the caption notes the television disappears during the zoom, it fails to describe how the framing of other elements, like the boombox or the top shelves, changes concurrently. For instance, the boombox might become more defined in the right background as the frame tightens. Furthermore, describing the man as simply using 'hand gestures' is static; a more dynamic description would specify that his hands move from out of frame into the lower portion of the shot as he begins to speak. Finally, the phrase 'highlighting his movement and expression' is slightly interpretive; a more objective statement would be that the tighter shot brings his face and upper torso to occupy the majority of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium shot of a man centrally positioned in the middle ground. Shelves filled with books and records frame him on the top and left, creating a backdrop that adds depth to the scene. A vintage television is visible in the bottom left, while a boombox sits on the right. As the man begins to speak, he leans forward, moving toward the foreground. The camera zooms in to a medium close-up, causing the television to disappear from view while the boombox becomes more prominent in the right background. The man's hand gestures dynamically enter the lower portion of the frame as he speaks. The tighter shot focuses on his face and upper torso, occupying the majority of the frame, while the camera remains level with the subject throughout the scene.",
