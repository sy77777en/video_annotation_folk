    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide, high-angle scenery shot. A brown bascule bridge extends diagonally from the bottom left foreground to the top right middle ground, with several tanks moving across it from right to left. The river occupies the center of the frame, flowing under the bridge. In the middle ground, a double-decker tour boat is positioned on the left, while a smaller speedboat travels slightly to its right, both moving away from the camera. The background is composed of city buildings along the top of the frame, a riverbank on the right, and a large splash of water erupting on the left. The camera remains stationary, providing a fixed, elevated view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a high-angle cityscape scenery shot, establishing a location and atmosphere of conflict. The focus is on the overall environment and scale rather than a specific subject, using the wide perspective to convey the scope of the event. The scene captures a brown metal bascule bridge with several military tanks moving across its span. Below, a double-decker tour boat and a smaller speedboat move through the dark river water. The background features modern city buildings, a grassy riverbank, an empty dirt lot, and a large splash in the water caused by waves.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures an aerial view of a city river during the daytime. The scene is centered on a brown steel bascule bridge, which spans the wide, dark water. The bridge features a light-colored stone tender house at both ends, and several tan-colored military tanks are moving across its roadway. In the river, a large, white double-decker tour boat and a smaller, faster speedboat creating a white wake are visible. The riverbanks are lined with modern city buildings, a paved riverwalk, and a small patch of green space. On the far bank, a large splash erupts from the water near an undeveloped dirt lot.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the key subjects and the overall camera movement, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and the relationship between the elements. For instance, describing the \"several tanks\" as a convoy of three moving in a tight formation from right to left would add detail. The description of the \"large splash of water\" is vague; if an object is seen hitting the water to cause the splash, this should be noted. Its position could also be more specific, such as erupting in the right middle ground, between the speedboat and the riverbank. The caption misses the opportunity to link the timing of events; for example, the splash occurs just as the lead tank reaches the center of the bridge, creating a clear dynamic focus. Furthermore, the effect of the camera's pan and tilt on the composition is not fully detailed. As the camera pans right and tilts up, the bridge and tanks should be described as shifting toward the bottom left of the frame, while the splash and the background buildings on the right become the dominant elements in the upper right quadrant, which would better explain the purpose of the camera's complex movement.",
