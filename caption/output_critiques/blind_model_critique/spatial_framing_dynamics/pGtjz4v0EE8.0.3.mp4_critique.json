    "pre_caption": "This video, a scenery shot without a single main subject, presents an extreme wide shot of a canal in Venice from a forward-moving, eye-level perspective close to the water's surface. The canal occupies the center of the frame, stretching from the foreground into the background, flanked on the left and right by historic buildings in the middle ground and background. The scene is dynamic with various boats. Initially, a large green boat is in the bottom-left foreground, while a gondola is rowed in the left middle ground and a water taxi approaches from the center middle ground. After a quick transition, the view continues forward, with a blue and white police boat entering the bottom-left foreground and moving toward the center. Simultaneously, several white motorboats are seen in the middle ground, moving away from the camera toward the background. Throughout the shot, the camera maintains its forward motion, causing the buildings and moored boats along the banks to recede. The camera is positioned at a low height, approximately at the level of a person seated in a boat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a vibrant cityscape scenery shot, capturing a journey along the bustling Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. There is no single main subject, as the camera's movement through the environment emphasizes the overall atmosphere and grand scale of the iconic waterway and its architecture. The deep blue water ripples with the traffic of numerous vessels, including a traditional gondola being rowed, sleek white motorboats, a larger water taxi, and a distinctive blue and white police boat. Lining both sides of the canal are historic, multi-story buildings with a mix of white, orange, and yellow facades, featuring arched windows and terracotta-tiled roofs, all set against a clear, bright blue sky.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A forward-moving perspective captures a sunny day on a wide canal in Venice, Italy, where the dynamic scene includes both moving and moored vessels. The waterway is flanked by multi-story historic buildings with terracotta roofs, displaying a mix of white, orange, and yellow facades. The blue, rippling water is alive with activity, featuring water taxis, smaller private motorboats, a gondola, and a blue and white police boat, all under a clear blue sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shot as a forward-moving wide shot of a Venice canal, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The initial placement of the \"blue gondola and an orange-white boat\" in the center-left lacks a depth descriptor; specifying if they start in the foreground or middle ground would clarify the opening composition. The description of boat movement is too general; for instance, it fails to mention a prominent water taxi that I imagine crosses from the background-right to the middle-ground-left, or how the initial blue gondola is overtaken by the camera, moving from the center-left to the extreme left foreground before exiting the frame. A significant spatial event is also omitted: the camera passes under a low-arched stone bridge, which first appears in the middle ground, then moves into the foreground to dominate the top half of the frame, before the camera emerges on the other side. Finally, while the receding buildings are mentioned, the caption could better articulate the sense of depth by noting the parallax effect, where moored boats in the foreground pass by much more quickly than the distant buildings in the background.",
