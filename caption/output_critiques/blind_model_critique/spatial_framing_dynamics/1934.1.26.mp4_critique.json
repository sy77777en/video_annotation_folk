    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of five individuals in white outfits with orange stripes, focusing on their upper bodies and heads. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. Four individuals are grouped closely in the foreground, forming a semi-circle around a central point. The person on the far left, holding a human-like object, is slightly more forward in the 2D frame, while the others lean in from the right side. The individual in the red top hat is centrally located in the 2D frame but slightly behind the others in the 3D space. The fifth person is positioned in the top right corner of the 2D frame, standing further back in the 3D space and appearing to work independently. The small black rectangular screen is placed on a white platform in the center of the 2D frame and in the middle ground of the 3D space. The background consists of plain white walls, creating a minimalist setting. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positions throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes, including hoods that cover their heads. One stands out by wearing a tall red top hat. While four individuals gather closely, their attention is focused on a human-like object held by the person on the left, rather than the small black rectangular screen. The fifth person, positioned at the top right, appears to be working independently.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, monochromatic design. The environment is characterized by stark white walls and a clean, uncluttered space. A group of individuals dressed in white suits with orange stripes is gathered around a small, black rectangular screen placed on a white platform. One person stands out with a red top hat, adding a splash of color to the otherwise uniform scene. The individuals are positioned closely together, intently watching a human-like white figure being held by the person on the left. The setting is devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the group. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the simplicity and uniformity of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good and largely successful. It is accurate, detailed, and follows most of the complex instructions for describing spatial framing. However, it contains one minor but clear violation of the negative constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its spatial descriptions. It correctly identifies the shot as a **medium shot** and the camera height as being at the **subjects' level**.\n*   The descriptions of 2D positions (far left, right side, centrally located, top right corner, center) and 3D positions (foreground, slightly behind, further back, middle ground) are precise and effectively map out the scene's depth and composition.\n*   The breakdown of the group into a foreground semi-circle and a separate individual in the background is an accurate observation of the spatial dynamics.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It accounts for all five individuals, distinguishing them by their relative positions and, in one case, by a unique feature (the red top hat).\n*   It successfully includes other key elements like the \"human-like object,\" the \"black rectangular screen,\" and the \"white walls\" of the background, assigning them appropriate spatial coordinates.\n*   It correctly addresses the lack of movement by stating, \"There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positions.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Spatial Framing:** The caption excels at its primary goal of describing spatial framing, providing both 2D and 3D positions for multiple subjects and elements as requested.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and organized into a coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Structure:** It correctly starts with the shot size and includes camera height, subject positions, and dynamics (or lack thereof).\n    *   **Objectivity:** For the most part, it avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives. \"Minimalist setting\" is a borderline subjective term but is acceptable as a descriptive summary of the plain white walls.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Avoidance of Speculative Statements:** The caption violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The phrase \"**appearing to work independently**\" is a direct violation of this rule. It describes a perceived intention or action rather than a purely spatial fact. A better, non-speculative alternative would be: \"...standing further back in the 3D space, separate from the other four individuals.\" This describes the spatial relationship without inferring the person's activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent in its detailed and accurate description of the scene's spatial composition. It successfully follows nearly all instructions. Its only flaw is the use of the speculative word \"appearing,\" which could be easily corrected to make the caption fully compliant with the rules.",
