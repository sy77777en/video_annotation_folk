    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of five individuals in white outfits with orange stripes, focusing on their upper bodies and heads. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level. Four individuals are grouped closely in the foreground, forming a semi-circle around a central point. The person on the far left, holding a human-like object, is slightly more forward in the 2D frame, while the others lean in from the right side. The individual in the red top hat is centrally located in the 2D frame but slightly behind the others in the 3D space. The fifth person is positioned in the top right corner of the 2D frame, standing further back in the 3D space and appearing to work independently. The small black rectangular screen is placed on a white platform in the center of the 2D frame and in the middle ground of the 3D space. The background consists of plain white walls, creating a minimalist setting. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positions throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes, including hoods that cover their heads. One stands out by wearing a tall red top hat. While four individuals gather closely, their attention is focused on a human-like object held by the person on the left, rather than the small black rectangular screen. The fifth person, positioned at the top right, appears to be working independently.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a minimalist, monochromatic design. The environment is characterized by stark white walls and a clean, uncluttered space. A group of individuals dressed in white suits with orange stripes is gathered around a small, black rectangular screen placed on a white platform. One person stands out with a red top hat, adding a splash of color to the otherwise uniform scene. The individuals are positioned closely together, intently watching a human-like white figure being held by the person on the left. The setting is devoid of additional furniture or props, emphasizing the focus on the group. The lighting is bright and even, highlighting the simplicity and uniformity of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the medium shot and the five subjects, but it could be more precise about their spatial arrangement and dynamics. The description of the main group is confusing; stating that \"two on the right are positioned in the foreground, while the person on the left and the one in the middle... are in the middle ground\" makes their grouping unclear. It would be better to describe them as a single group arranged in a staggered formation, with the two rightmost individuals closer to the camera. Furthermore, the caption contradicts itself by stating the person in the top right is \"working independently\" while also claiming there are \"no noticeable changes in... spatial positions.\" The repetitive arm movements of this individual as they interact with a console are a key dynamic that should be described. Similarly, the caption omits the subtle, synchronized swaying motion of the central group and fails to mention the simple, looping geometric animation visible on the central black screen, which is another moving element within the static frame. Describing these subtle but continuous movements would provide a much more accurate account of the video's spatial dynamics.",
