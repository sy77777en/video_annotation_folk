    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames a woman from the waist up, positioned in the center foreground. To her right, a large, blue-lit abstract structure occupies the background, while the rest of the background is dark. Initially facing the camera, she turns her upper body to her left, looking toward the left side of the frame while remaining centrally positioned. The camera is static and positioned at her level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned, middle-aged woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is shown speaking. She is wearing a brown, long-sleeved, V-neck top with a matching brown belt at her waist. A small microphone is clipped to the neckline of her top. She wears bracelets on her left wrist and a watch on her right wrist. Throughout the video, she gestures with her hands while talking and at one point holds a small, dark object, initially in her left hand before transitioning it to her right hand. Her facial expression is animated as she speaks.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a dimly lit stage against a dark background. To the right, a large, multi-tiered, abstract structure is illuminated with a vibrant blue light, contrasting with the surrounding darkness. The lighting is focused on the center of the stage, where a person is standing.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of its quality:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the **shot size** as a \"medium shot\" and justifies it by stating the woman is framed \"from the waist up.\" It accurately describes the **spatial positions**: the woman is in the \"center foreground,\" and the structure is \"to her right\" in the \"background.\" The description of her movement—turning her upper body \"to her left\"—is also precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete and covers all the required elements from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** \"A medium shot frames a woman from the waist up...\"\n*   **2D & 3D Position:** It successfully describes the woman (\"center foreground\") and the background structure (\"to her right... in the background\").\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It clearly explains the change in the woman's orientation (\"Initially facing the camera, she turns her upper body to her left\") while noting her static position within the frame (\"remaining centrally positioned\").\n*   **Camera Properties:** It correctly includes the camera's state (\"static\") and its height relative to the subject (\"positioned at her level\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption perfectly adheres to all stylistic and structural rules:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs all the necessary spatial information into a few clear sentences.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional words (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"mysterious\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Structure:** It follows the requested logical flow, starting with the overall shot, moving to the subject's position, describing background elements, and concluding with the movement.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown formatting.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It is accurate, thorough, and follows every instruction precisely.",
