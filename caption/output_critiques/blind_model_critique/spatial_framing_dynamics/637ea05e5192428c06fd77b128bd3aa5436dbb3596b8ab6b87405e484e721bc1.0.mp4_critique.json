    "pre_caption": "The video features an extreme wide shot of a lush, mountainous landscape. The dense forest of evergreen trees occupies the foreground and middle ground, stretching across the bottom and center of the frame. The mountain peaks, partially shrouded in mist, are positioned in the middle ground and background, extending from the left to the center. The sky, with its partly cloudy appearance, forms the background, occupying the top portion of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high elevation, captures the scene from above, emphasizing the vastness and scale of the landscape. The drone's movement provides a sweeping view, maintaining a consistent framing of the expansive environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast expanse of lush, green forested mountains under a bright, partly cloudy sky. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the dense tree coverage and the mist gently rolling over the mountain peaks. The emphasis is on the natural beauty and scale of the landscape, rather than any specific object, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and grandeur.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, filmed by a drone, captures a sweeping view of a lush, mountainous landscape during the day. The scene is set outdoors, showcasing a dense forest of evergreen trees covering the rolling hills. The sky is partly cloudy, with patches of blue visible through the white clouds. Mist gently drifts over the mountain peaks, adding a dynamic element to the serene environment. The vibrant green of the trees contrasts with the soft white clouds, creating a picturesque natural setting. The drone's perspective provides a broad, elevated view, emphasizing the vastness and tranquility of the forested mountains.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the static elements. It correctly identifies the shot as an extreme wide shot and accurately places the forest, mountains, and sky in their respective 2D (bottom, center, top) and 3D (foreground, middle ground, background) positions. However, the description of movement is inaccurate and contradictory. It states the drone's movement provides a \"sweeping view\" while also \"maintaining a consistent framing,\" which are opposing concepts. A sweeping view implies the framing is changing, not staying consistent.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete in its description of spatial dynamics. While it mentions \"drone's movement,\" it fails to describe the specific nature of this movement as required by the instructions. It does not specify the direction or type of movement (e.g., panning left, flying forward, tilting down), nor does it explain how this movement alters the spatial relationship between the elements in the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres well to several instructions:\n*   It correctly identifies the shot size for a scenery shot.\n*   It provides both 2D and 3D positions for the main elements.\n*   It describes the camera's high-angle position.\n*   It is written in a single paragraph using simple English and avoids speculation.\n\nHowever, it fails to adhere to the following key instructions:\n*   **Describe Spatial Dynamics:** It does not clearly describe the changes in spatial framing caused by camera movement.\n*   **Avoid Subjective Language:** The adjective \"lush\" is subjective. The phrase \"emphasizing the vastness and scale of the landscape\" is an interpretive statement about the effect of the shot, not an objective description of the spatial framing itself, which the instructions advise against.",

The sky, with its partly cloudy appearance, forms the background, occupying the top portion of the frame. The camera, positioned at a high elevation, captures the scene from above. The drone moves forward, gradually revealing more of the landscape and altering the spatial relationship between the forest and mountains, as the mountains become more prominent in the frame.",
