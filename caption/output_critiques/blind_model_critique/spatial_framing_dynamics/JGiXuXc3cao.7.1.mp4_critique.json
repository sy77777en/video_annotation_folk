    "pre_caption": "A medium shot frames an older man in the middle ground, positioned on the right side of the screen. He holds a large, rectangular image in the foreground, which occupies the left half of the frame. His right hand extends from the right toward the center-left, with his index finger pointing at the image. In the background, a blurred geometric structure is visible in the center-right, and a wooden surface sits at the bottom of the frame. The camera is positioned at the subject's height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **An animated, older man with white hair and a grey suit is shown in profile, looking intently at a rectangular image he holds in his hands. He points with his right index finger at a vertical, slightly rectangular, irregular geometric shape depicted against a teal background on the image. The shape has a mottled texture with hints of green and purple. The man's expression is focused as he examines the detail he is pointing to.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an animated indoor setting, an older man with white hair, wearing a grey suit, holds up a large, teal-colored panel. He points his index finger at a vertical, irregular geometric shape depicted on the panel. The background is softly blurred, showing a wooden surface and the indistinct outline of a gray geometric shape composed of rectangles, enhancing the overall indoor ambiance.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and key elements, establishing their basic 2D and 3D positions. However, it lacks a description of dynamics and could be more precise about spatial relationships. For instance, the video I watched shows the man's index finger is not static; it moves from the center of the image toward its top-left corner, tracing a specific detail. The caption also misses clarifying the man's posture and how much of him is visible in the medium close-up; in the video, he is framed from the chest up and leans slightly forward over the image. Furthermore, the relationship between the image and the wooden surface is unclear. The caption should specify that the image is resting on the wooden surface, which is a table, connecting these two foreground elements. Finally, the description of the hand's movement is slightly wordy, and the phrase \"blurred geometric structure\" could be more specific if the shape is discernible, such as a \"blurred window frame,\" which is what I saw in the background.",
