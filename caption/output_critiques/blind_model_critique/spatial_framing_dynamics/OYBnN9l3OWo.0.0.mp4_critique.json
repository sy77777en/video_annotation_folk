    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a full shot of a woman standing in the center foreground. In the middle ground, a black church is positioned in the upper center-right of the frame, with mountains visible in the background. The shot then zooms in, transitioning to a close-up of the woman, who remains in the center of the frame as she raises a camera to her face. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with light skin and blonde hair stands in a field. She is wearing a bright orange puffer jacket, black pants, white boots, and a light gray beanie. She holds a black camera with a strap and then raises it to her face, looking through the viewfinder as if to take a picture.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set outdoors in a wide, open field of dry, brownish grass in Iceland. In the background, a distinctive black wooden church with a steepled roof and white-trimmed windows stands against a backdrop of distant, hazy mountains under an overcast sky. A person in an orange puffer jacket and a grey beanie stands in the foreground, holding a camera. They raise the camera to their face as if taking a photograph. An overlay of white text at the top of the scene reads, \"Tonight there's gonna be STRONG Northern Lights in Iceland\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately uses descriptive terminology. It correctly identifies the initial \"full shot\" and the transition to a \"close-up.\" It precisely describes the 2D position (\"center,\" \"upper center-right\") and 3D depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") of the woman, the church, and the mountains, creating a clear mental image of the scene's composition.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very thorough. It covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It specifies both the initial (\"full shot\") and final (\"close-up\") shot sizes.\n    *   **Position:** It details the 2D and 3D positions of all key subjects and elements.\n    *   **Depth:** The use of foreground, middle ground, and background effectively describes the scene's depth.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly includes the statement about the camera being at the subject's level.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It clearly describes the camera movement (\"zooms in\") and the subject's movement (\"raises a camera to her face\"), fulfilling the core requirement to describe spatial dynamics.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all constraints perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n    *   It focuses strictly on spatial framing and movement, without adding any narrative or interpretive details.\n    *   It is concise while remaining highly informative.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a full shot of a woman standing prominently in the center foreground. In the middle ground, a black church is situated in the upper center-right of the frame, with mountains visible in the background. The shot then zooms in, transitioning to a close-up of the woman, who stays centered in the frame as she lifts a camera to her face. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the video.",
