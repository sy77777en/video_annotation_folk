    "pre_caption": "In a high-angle full shot, a long, dark table extends from the bottom foreground toward the right middle ground. In the middle ground, a group of brown-colored figures and one red figure stand behind the right side of the table, while other brown figures are positioned in the foreground at the bottom of the frame, facing the table. A grid pattern with white objects sits on the table in the right middle ground, and a red glow emanates from beneath the table in the center foreground. Initially appearing as an amorphous shape in the center-left middle ground, a blue figure solidifies and walks left, exiting the scene through a dark doorway on the far left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features multiple figures, primarily men, in a dark setting. Most of the men are rendered in a textured, brown material, wearing military-style uniforms with hats. One man is distinguished by his red uniform and hat. A single figure, also a man, is rendered in blue and is seen walking away from the group through a doorway. In the center, there is a large, dark rectangular table with a grid pattern, on which white rectangular objects are placed, around which some of the men are gathered.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video presents an overhead view of a dark, enclosed space where numerous figures stand around a rectangular table. The figures, primarily rendered in shades of brown, appear to be miniature statues or figurines. One figure, colored blue, stands apart from the rest, seemingly moving away from the group. The table features a grid-like pattern in the center, where a few white rectangular objects are placed. The scene is dimly lit, with a red glow emanating from beneath the table.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key subjects (table, figures, grid) and their spatial properties. The description of the table extending from the foreground to the middle ground, the placement of the figures in the foreground and middle ground, and the location of the grid and glow are all precise representations of the scene's composition. The description of the blue figure's transformation and movement is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers:\n*   **Shot Size and Angle:** \"high-angle full shot\" is stated at the beginning.\n*   **Subjects and Elements:** It details the table, multiple groups of figures, a grid pattern, a glow, and a doorway.\n*   **2D and 3D Position:** It consistently provides both 2D (bottom, right, center-left) and 3D (foreground, middle ground) positions for all major elements.\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It effectively describes the key movement in the video—the blue figure solidifying, walking, and exiting the frame.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but there is one specific violation.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"brown-colored figures\" instead of \"ominous figures\").\n    *   It focuses entirely on spatial framing and dynamics as requested.\n    *   It clearly describes the initial and final states of the moving subject.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' '**it appears**,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'.\" The caption's phrase \"**Initially appearing as** an amorphous shape...\" directly violates this rule by using a form of the forbidden word \"appear.\" Although the intent is to describe a visual process rather than to speculate, the instruction is strict.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, completeness, and overall adherence to the descriptive goals. It provides a clear and detailed spatial analysis of the scene. However, it fails on one specific negative constraint by using the word \"appearing.\" To be perfect, it should be rephrased to describe the transformation without using that specific word (e.g., \"From an amorphous shape in the center-left middle ground, a blue figure solidifies...\").",
