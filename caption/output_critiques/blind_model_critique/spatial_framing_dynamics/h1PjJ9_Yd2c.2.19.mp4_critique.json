    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot features a young woman in the right foreground, positioned in profile and looking toward the left. Her out-of-focus reflection is visible in a mirror in the left middle ground. In the background, a window is visible in the center, and shelves are on the right. The woman briefly turns her head slightly toward the camera before returning to her initial profile position. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young woman with long brown hair pulled back into a high ponytail is shown in profile, looking towards the left. She wears a grey, short-sleeved t-shirt. Her reflection is visible in a mirror, also in profile. She appears to be speaking, with a slight smile on her face.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene is characterized by a muted, cool-toned color palette and soft, diffuse lighting. A girl is turning her body as if she is about to leave the room. A large mirror is positioned in the room, showing a blurry reflection. In the background, a window with horizontal blinds is visible, along with shelves holding various containers. The walls are a light, neutral color.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the woman's movement contains a contradiction, as moving \"closer to the camera\" conflictos with the speculative interpretation that she is \"about to leave the room.\" A more likely scenario is that she turns her head toward the camera momentarily before moving laterally to the left and exiting the frame, which would be a more direct way to describe leaving. The phrase \"appears as if she is about to leave the room\" should be replaced with a factual description of her final action, such as \"she then moves left, her body blurring as she exits the frame.\" The caption could also be more specific about the focus, clarifying that the focus पुलिस on her initial position, causing her to go out of focus as she moves away from that fixed plane. Additionally, describing the initial shot as a \"close-up\" of a subject in the \"foreground\" is slightly redundant; specifying it as a \"medium close-up showing her head and shoulders\" would be more precise. The description also neglects to mention how her reflection in the mirror on the left moves in tandem with her, disappearing from view as she exits the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This medium close-up shot shows a young woman in profile in the right foreground, focusing on her head and shoulders. Her reflection is visible in a mirror in the left middle ground. In the background, a window is centered, with shelves on the right. The woman briefly turns her head toward the camera before moving laterally to the left, her body blurring as she exits the frame. Her reflection in the mirror moves in tandem with her, disappearing from view. The camera remains stationary and at the subject's level throughout the shot, maintaining focus on her initial position.",
