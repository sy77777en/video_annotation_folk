    "pre_caption": "This full shot frames a woman standing in the center of the middle ground, holding a small basket. In the foreground, a child is seated on the floor in the bottom right, with their back to the camera. Another person is partially visible standing in the background, to the left of the woman. The scene is framed by out-of-focus household items across the bottom foreground. On the left, metal pots are stacked in the middle ground, while shelves filled with woven baskets occupy the right side of the frame, extending from the middle ground to the background. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit, cluttered room, a stop-motion puppet of a woman with dark skin stands in the center, facing slightly to her left. She wears a patterned, short-sleeved dress and holds a small woven basket in the crook of her right arm. Her dark hair is pulled back, and her eyes are closed with a slight smile on her face. In the foreground, with her back to the viewer, a small child puppet with dark hair sits on the floor wearing a purple dress, looking toward the woman. Partially visible in the background behind the woman is another puppet, a person with dark curly hair wearing a light-colored, plain shirt.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set within a dimly lit and cluttered indoor space, characteristic of a stop-motion animation. The room is filled with an assortment of objects, with wooden shelves on the right stacked high with numerous woven baskets of various shapes and sizes. A small, colorful, tiered object rests on an upper shelf. In the background, colorful clothing, including yellow and purple garments, hangs near a doorway. The left side of the room contains stacked metal pots and pans. The overall environment has an earthy feel, with rough-textured walls and floors. Light enters from an opening in the background, casting the foreground, which is filled with out-of-focus household items, into shadow. A figure of a woman in an orange sari stands in the illuminated center, while a child in a blue dress is seated on the floor in the foreground, viewed from the back.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview of the scene's composition but misses key dynamic elements and lacks precision. It describes the scene as static, whereas the video shows the woman in the center-left middle ground actively lowering the basket, and the child on the right is not just seated but is turning to look at a toy on the floor. This interaction between the subjects is a crucial spatial element. The term 'full shot' is also inaccurate, as the framing is a medium-long shot that cuts off below the woman's knees. Additionally, the 'person...partially visible' is not stationary but is briefly seen walking through a doorway in the deep background, adding a layer of depth and activity. Finally, the 'out-of-focus household items' in the left foreground could be more specifically described as the corner of a wooden table, which serves as a distinct framing element for the entire composition.",

In the bottom right foreground, a child is turning to look at a toy on the floor. In the deep background, a person briefly walks through a doorway, adding depth and activity to the composition.
