    "pre_caption": "In a wide shot, a small, insectoid character is positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing on a floating platform in the middle ground. The scene is framed by dark cavern walls on the left and right sides in the foreground and middle ground. Additional platforms are scattered vertically throughout the middle ground, while glowing, butterfly-like creatures flutter in the foreground, middle ground, and background. A user interface is fixed in the top left corner as an overlay. As the character jumps upwards and to the right, landing on successively higher platforms, the camera, positioned at the subject's level, scrolls vertically to follow its movement, keeping the character in the frame as it ascends toward the top right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A small, insectoid character with a black body is depicted wearing a tattered, dark cloak. Its head is a smooth, white, mask-like shell featuring two large, black, hollow eye sockets and two short, pointed horns on top. Also present are numerous glowing, light-blue, stylized butterfly-like creatures. In the upper left corner, a user interface displays an icon of the main character's head, a row of six white mask icons, and the number 829 next to a small, circular, gear-like symbol.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a side-view gaming video where the camera is placed to the side, capturing the scene in profile, the setting is a dark, vertical cavern. Small, dark, floating platforms are scattered throughout the space, allowing for upward movement. The cavern is illuminated by a hazy, central beam of blue light and is filled with numerous glowing, light-blue, butterfly-like creatures that flutter around. Similar glowing flora grows on the dark, rocky walls of the cavern. Small, white, glowing particles drift downwards throughout the scene. An overlay is present in the top left corner, showing a heads-up display with a series of mask icons and a numerical counter at 829.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main action and camera movement, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and visual effects. While it describes the camera following the character vertically, it could more explicitly state that this causes the character to drift from the center-left hacia the top-right of the frame, rather than being kept centered. The term \"wide shot\" might be inaccurate; if the character's details are visible, a \"medium-long shot\" would be more appropriate. The description of the glowing creatures as simply \"fluttering\" is a missed opportunity; the caption could specify if they exhibit parallax motion, with foreground creatures moving faster than those in the background as the camera scrolls, which would be a key element of the scene's depth. Additionally, the description of the cavern walls and platforms is static; it fails to mention if these background and middle-ground layers also scroll at different speeds to enhance the three-dimensional effect, which is a crucial aspect of the video's spatial framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium-long shot, a small, insectoid character is positioned in the center-left of the frame, standing on a floating platform in the middle ground.
