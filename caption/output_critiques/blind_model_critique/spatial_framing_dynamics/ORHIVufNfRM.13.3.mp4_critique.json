    "pre_caption": "This video presents a first-person perspective moving forward through a dense, underwater forest. The view is framed in the foreground by a dark, reddish-orange border, with a vehicle's interior visible at the bottom center. Tall, trunk-like structures rise from the seafloor at the bottom of the frame and extend towards the top, populating the middle ground and background to create a sense of depth. As the camera advances and moves slightly to the right, these structures, along with the small, glowing green and pink organisms attached to them, shift from the center towards the left and right sides of the frame. Initially, a small, glowing blue creature is visible in the bottom left midground. As the camera proceeds, a jellyfish-like creature with a glowing blue body and a long tentacle appears in the bottom right of the middle ground and drifts through the scene. The camera is positioned amidst the trunks, looking slightly upward towards the large, reddish-pink caps that occupy the upper half of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a first-person perspective of an underwater, bioluminescent forest. The scene is dominated by enormous, dark green, trunk-like structures that rise from the sandy seafloor. These trunks are adorned with large, flat, reddish-pink, mushroom-like caps that have a porous, light-colored underside. Clinging to the sides of these trunks are small, lumpy, bright green organisms that glow intensely. Small, glowing pink rings are attached to the trunks. A small, jellyfish-like creature with a bright, glowing blue body and a long, trailing tentacle swims in the bottom right of the midground. The entire view is framed by a dark, reddish-orange border, suggesting it is seen from inside a helmet or a submersible vehicle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves through a dark, underwater forest with greenish-teal water. The scene is dominated by tall, stalk-like structures resembling giant mushrooms with thick, dark trunks and wide, reddish-pink caps that have a porous texture on their undersides. The mushroom stalks are dotted with glowing green, peanut-shaped organisms and small, pink, glowing rings. A small, jellyfish-like creature with a bright blue, trailing tentacle drifts around the bottom right of the scene. The sandy seabed is a mix of pale sand and patches of dark flora. The view is framed by a reddish-orange overlay element, suggesting the perspective of a diver, with a small part of a vehicle's interior visible at the bottom. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"Loopy Longplays\".**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It meticulously follows all instructions to create a clear, accurate, and comprehensive description of the scene's spatial dynamics.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Objectivity:** The caption uses precise, objective language. Instead of speculating on the nature of the elements, it uses descriptive terms like \"trunk-like structures\" and \"jellyfish-like creature,\" which adheres to the instruction to avoid uncertainty. It accurately describes a plausible first-person view from a vehicle.\n\n*   **Completeness and Detail:** The caption successfully addresses every component requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It correctly identifies the shot as a \"first-person perspective,\" which effectively describes the framing in relation to the environment.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D and 3D):** It excels at this, consistently providing both the 2D position within the frame (e.g., \"bottom center,\" \"bottom left,\" \"upper half\") and the 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for multiple elements.\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** It clearly states the camera is \"positioned amidst the trunks, looking slightly upward,\" fulfilling this specific requirement.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics and Movement:** It thoroughly describes the camera's forward and rightward movement and the resulting parallax shift of the scenery. It also captures the dynamic appearance and movement of the creatures within the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Constraints:** The caption strictly follows the negative constraints:\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"eerie\").\n    *   It avoids speculative phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand while remaining highly informative.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It perfectly balances conciseness with a high level of detail, focusing entirely on the spatial framing and movement to produce a technically sound and descriptive analysis of the video.",
