    "pre_caption": "The video, shot from inside an open refrigerator, initially presents a full shot of a man positioned in the background, center. In the foreground, left, a large bowl containing strawberries is visible. In the middle ground, a stack of three clear food containers rests on a shelf to the right. Further right and slightly behind these containers, also in the middle ground, two green glass bottles are partially visible in the refrigerator door. The man moves from the background towards the middle ground, center. As he reaches in and takes the stack of containers from the shelf, the framing on him changes to a medium shot. He then holds the containers in the middle ground, center, while the bowl of strawberries remains in the foreground, left, and the bottles stay in the middle ground, right. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video, filmed from inside an open refrigerator, shows a man with short, light brown hair and a clean-shaven face, wearing a dark maroon short-sleeved polo shirt. He initially stands looking into the refrigerator, then reaches in with his right hand and takes out a stack of three clear, rectangular glass food containers with light blue-grey sealed lids. The top container holds a red, pureed substance; the middle container is filled with chopped red, orange, and pale yellow fruits or vegetables; and the bottom container contains green leafy vegetables and some white, stick-like vegetables. On the bottom shelf to the left, a large, light-colored bowl holds several red strawberries with green tops. In the refrigerator door on the right, two green glass bottles are partially visible, with a beige carton, likely a milk carton, to their left and a brown glass bottle to their right. The man smiles slightly as he lifts the containers.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, shot from inside an open refrigerator, shows a man in a dark polo shirt approaching. The refrigerator's interior is white, with glass shelves. On the left, a large white bowl contains strawberries. To the right, three clear glass containers with light blue-grey sealed lids are stacked; the top one holds a red substance, the middle one contains chopped red, orange, and pale yellow fruits or vegetables, and the bottom one is filled with green leafy vegetables and white root vegetables. Two green glass bottles are visible in the refrigerator door. The man reaches in and takes the stack of three containers.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key elements and their initial positions, but it misses the dynamic changes in framing and interaction that occur. While it notes the man moves from the background to the middle ground, it fails to specify that this action changes the shot size from a full shot to a medium shot of his upper body. The description of him taking the containers is also too general; it should detail his arm extending from the center across the frame to the right to retrieve them. A crucial missing detail is the resulting occlusion—his arm would temporarily block the view of the green bottles as he reaches. Furthermore, the caption states he holds the containers in the center, but it omits the motion of him bringing them from the right shelf back to the center of the frame. Finally, describing the camera as at the \"subject's level\" is vague; \"chest-level\" would be more precise for a camera on a refrigerator shelf.",
