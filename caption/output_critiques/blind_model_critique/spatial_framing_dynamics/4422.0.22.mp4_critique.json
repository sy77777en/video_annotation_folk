    "pre_caption": "This wide shot frames a man playing a drum set, positioned slightly left of the center in the middle ground. The dark, textured rooftop occupies the bottom half of the frame, extending from the foreground into the middle ground where the man is situated. In the background, various buildings are visible across the upper middle portion of the frame, with an overcast sky filling the top portion in the far background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level, with a distinct Dutch angle tilt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man, seen from the back, wears a light-colored suit jacket and matching trousers, with a white hoodie underneath, such that the hood is visible at the back of his neck. He is seated and actively playing a metallic silver drum set that includes gold or brass-colored cymbals.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor urban scene. A person in a light blue suit plays a silver drum set on a dark, textured rooftop. In the background, various buildings of different heights and styles are visible under an overcast, greyish-white sky.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but lacks specificity and overlooks key dynamic effects. While it correctly identifies the shot as wide, it fails to specify that the man is visible from the waist up, making \"medium-long shot\" a more accurate descriptor. The man is not perfectly \"centrally\" located; he is positioned on the right third of the frame, which gives visual weight to the expansive cityscape on the left. The most significant omission is how the \"counterclockwise roll\" affects the main subject; as the camera rolls, the man and his drum set appear to tilt diagonally across the frame, a crucial visual dynamic that is ignored. The description of the rooftop occupying the \"bottom half\" is an oversimplification, as it actually forms the bottom third, creating a more balanced composition with the subject and the sky. Lastly, the caption neglects to mention the drum set's components, such as the high-hat and crash cymbal that frame the man's upper body and periodically glint as they move.",
