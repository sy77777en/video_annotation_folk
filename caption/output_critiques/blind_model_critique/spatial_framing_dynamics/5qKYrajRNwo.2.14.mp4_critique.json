    "pre_caption": "The video features a medium shot of a young girl positioned in the center of the frame, interacting with a small, open chest. She is in the foreground, with her body facing slightly to the right. The chest is located to her left, occupying the middle ground. The girl holds a golden pocket watch in her hands, which she examines closely. The camera remains at her eye level throughout the scene. In the background, the room's walls with circular cutouts allow soft light to filter through, creating a warm ambiance. The vintage lantern is positioned to the left of the chest, adding to the rustic setting. The girl's facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile as she interacts with the watch, maintaining focus on the object. The spatial composition emphasizes the intimate interaction between the girl and the chest's contents.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young girl with long, dark braided hair and a light skin tone. She is wearing a dark blue dress and is engaged with a small, open chest. In her hands, she holds a golden pocket watch, examining it closely. Her facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile, indicating interest and satisfaction. The setting suggests an intimate, focused moment as she interacts with the object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting with a warm, dimly lit atmosphere. The environment features a rustic room with wooden elements, including a table and a vintage lantern. A chest is open, revealing its contents, which include a small, round object and a gold chain. The walls have a pattern of circular cutouts, allowing soft light to filter through, creating a cozy ambiance. The scene is characterized by a sense of discovery and curiosity, with a focus on the interaction with the chest and its intriguing items. The overall color palette is earthy and muted, enhancing the intimate and nostalgic feel of the setting.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and focus on spatial framing.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Inaccurate 3D Positioning:** The caption states the girl is in the **foreground** while the chest she is interacting with is in the **middle ground**. This is spatially contradictory. If a subject is directly interacting with an object, they typically occupy the same depth plane. Both the girl and the chest should be described as being in the foreground.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the shot size, the main subject, and several key elements (chest, watch, lantern, walls).\n*   It correctly notes the camera height and the static nature of the shot.\n*   It could be more precise with 2D positioning. For example, instead of just \"to her left,\" it could specify the chest's position within the frame itself (e.g., \"in the center-left of the frame\").\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption includes numerous subjective and emotional terms, which were explicitly forbidden. Examples include \"warm ambiance,\" \"vintage lantern,\" \"rustic setting,\" \"curiosity,\" \"gentle smile,\" and \"intimate interaction.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Describe spatial framing and dynamics\":** The caption deviates significantly from its primary goal. The last two sentences focus entirely on the girl's emotional journey (\"facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile\") and an interpretive summary of the scene's theme (\"emphasizes the intimate interaction\"). These do not describe spatial framing.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** Phrases like \"adding to the rustic setting\" and \"creating a warm ambiance\" are interpretations of the scene's mood and purpose, not objective descriptions of spatial elements.",
