    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium close-up shot of the man, focusing on his upper body and head as he walks through the field. He is positioned in the center of the frame, with the tall grasses surrounding him in the foreground and middle ground. The grasses extend from the bottom left to the top right, creating a dense, textured environment around him. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a medium shot, capturing more of the man's body while maintaining his central position. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, providing a consistent perspective. The background features leafless trees and a partly cloudy sky, situated at the top of the frame. The man moves steadily forward, and the camera follows his movement, keeping him centered as he navigates through the field. The spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the man and the expansive natural setting, highlighting his journey through the grassy terrain.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with short, dark hair, seen from behind as he walks through a field of tall, dry grasses. He is wearing a brown jacket and carries a large, beige backpack with multiple compartments. The backpack has a rectangular patch on the back. The man appears to be moving forward, surrounded by the swaying grasses, which are light brown and reach up to his shoulders. The scene conveys a sense of exploration or journey through a natural setting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in a field of tall, golden grasses swaying gently in the breeze. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, with soft, diffused sunlight filtering through a partly cloudy sky, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the background, leafless trees form a dark silhouette against the sky, suggesting a season of late autumn or early winter. The grasses are slender and topped with feathery plumes, adding texture to the landscape. A person with a backpack is present, moving through the field, their back to the viewer, which adds a sense of scale and direction to the scene. The overall atmosphere is calm and natural, with a focus on the interaction between the person and the expansive, serene environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good and closely follows the majority of the instructions. It successfully describes the spatial framing and dynamics of the scene with a high level of detail. However, there is a minor area for improvement regarding conciseness and adherence to purely descriptive language.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its use of technical and descriptive terms. It correctly identifies a \"medium close-up\" transitioning to a \"medium shot,\" which are appropriate descriptions for the framing described.\n*   The spatial descriptions (man in the center, grasses in the foreground/middle ground, trees/sky in the background/top) are precise and logical.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Shot Size:** Excellent. It clearly states the initial shot size (\"medium close-up\") and the transition to the final shot size (\"medium shot\").\n*   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** Excellent. It effectively describes the 2D position (\"center,\" \"bottom left to the top right,\" \"top of the frame\") and 3D depth (\"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for the man, grasses, and background elements.\n*   **Camera Height:** Excellent. It correctly identifies the camera's position as being \"at the subject's level.\"\n*   **Movement & Dynamics:** Excellent. It clearly describes the man's forward movement and the camera's corresponding tracking movement (\"the camera follows his movement, keeping him centered\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It successfully avoids speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and ambiguous options.\n    *   It focuses entirely on visible elements and their spatial relationships, as instructed.\n    *   The level of detail, such as describing the grasses extending \"from the bottom left to the top right,\" is a perfect example of following the instruction to analyze elements' positions within the frame.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjectivity and Interpretation:** The final sentence, \"The spatial dynamics emphasize the interaction between the man and the expansive natural setting, highlighting his journey through the grassy terrain,\" deviates slightly from the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and to describe rather than interpret. Words like \"expansive\" can be subjective, and phrases like \"emphasize the interaction\" and \"highlighting his journey\" are analytical conclusions rather than direct descriptions of spatial dynamics. While the instruction asks to \"highlight essential details,\" this sentence interprets the *effect* of those details. A more direct and descriptive conclusion would be more in line with the instructions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is a high-quality response that fulfills almost all requirements. To make it perfect, the final sentence could be removed or rephrased to be purely descriptive, eliminating the interpretive analysis and subjective language. For example, ending the caption at \"...as he navigates through the field\" would make it more concise and strictly adherent to all rules.",
