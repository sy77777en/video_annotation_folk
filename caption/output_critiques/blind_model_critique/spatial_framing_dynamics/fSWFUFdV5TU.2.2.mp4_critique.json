    "pre_caption": "A medium shot shows a man from behind, positioned in the center foreground as he leans over a light-colored wall. In the background, a dark cityscape with blurred lights is visible, and small white particles fall throughout the scene. The man, initially leaning forward, lowers his head to rest on his forearms against the wall. The camera remains static and is positioned at the man's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, curly hair is shown from behind, wearing a dark, possibly denim, jacket with prominent seams. He is leaning forward and bending down over a low wall, resting his head on his forearms or in his hands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a balcony at night, overlooking a dark cityscape where building lights appear as blurred, out-of-focus points in the distance. Small white particles fall steadily through the air. In the foreground, a person in a dark jacket leans forward and bends down slightly over a plain, light-colored wall, appearing to be deeply engaged with the view of the cityscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but misses some key spatial dynamics and details that would make the description more vivid and accurate. While it correctly identifies the man in the center middle ground, it could be more specific by stating that the light-colored wall he leans over occupies the foreground along the bottom edge of the frame, creating a distinct layering effect. The description of the man's movement from leaning to squatting is accurate, but it omits the resulting change in his position within the frame; his head and shoulders transition from the upper half of the frame to the lower half, a significant vertical shift. Furthermore, the caption could more explicitly connect the camera's downward tilt to this action, clarifying that the camera is tracking his movement. Lastly, the \"small white particles\" are mentioned, but their placement in depth is not described; specifying that they fall through both the foreground and middle ground would better illustrate the scene's three-dimensional quality.",
