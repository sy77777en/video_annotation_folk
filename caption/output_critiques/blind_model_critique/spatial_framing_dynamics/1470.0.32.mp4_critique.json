    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman is positioned in the center-right of the frame and in the middle ground, sitting in a bathtub. A dark, out-of-focus object is in the foreground on the left, partially obscuring the view of the woman. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down at her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A light-skinned young woman with blonde hair sits in a bathtub filled with white soap bubbles that cover her up to her chest. Her hair is wrapped in a pink towel, and she wears orange earmuffs. Her mouth is wide open, and her eyes are widened with a look of fear directed diagonally upward, as if she is screaming. In the foreground, a dark, out-of-focus shape partially obscures the view on the left.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a bathroom, a bathtub is filled with an abundance of white soap foam. A person with a pink towel wrapped around their head and wearing orange earmuffs is partially submerged in the bubbles, their mouth open wide. The scene is partially obstructed on the left by a dark, out-of-focus object in the foreground.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by correctly identifying the shot size, camera angle, and the general placement of the woman and other elements. However, it incorrectly portrays the scene as static. In the video, the woman is not still; she is slowly leaning forward to adjust a tap, causing her to move from the center-right further toward the center of the frame and slightly deeper into the middle ground. This movement is a key dynamic that the caption omits. Additionally, the \"dark, out-of-focus object\" in the foreground is clearly the corner of a dark vanity or cabinet, not just an ambiguous object, which is a detail that could be specified for better clarity. The description of the background is accurate but could be more concise; stating that a radiator and a blue towel are against the blurred brown background wall would streamline the information. The high-angle shot remains consistent, but failing to mention the subject's forward movement is a significant oversight in describing the spatial dynamics.",

She slowly leans forward to adjust a tap, moving toward the center of the frame and slightly deeper into the middle ground. A dark vanity or cabinet corner is out of focus in the foreground on the left, partially obscuring the view. The camera is positioned above, looking down at her.
