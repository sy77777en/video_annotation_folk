    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a man, who is consistently centered in the foreground. He is skiing down a snowy slope that occupies the background, stretching from the bottom to the top of the frame. Evergreen trees are visible in the middle ground to background on both the left and right sides of the slope, under an overcast sky at the top of the frame. One of his ski poles is occasionally visible in the left foreground. As he descends, fresh powder snow sprays upwards from the bottom of the frame, sometimes partially obscuring the lower portion of the man and the immediate foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man, seen from a very close, first-person perspective, likely from a camera mounted on his helmet. He is wearing a light-colored, possibly white and grey camouflage-patterned ski jacket. He has a prominent, light brown or reddish beard and mustache, which become increasingly covered in white snow as the video progresses. He wears a light blue or teal ski helmet with a orange logo and the text \"pecsports.com\" on the side, and a white sticker that says \"Be a HERO.\" His eyes are covered by large, orange-lensed ski goggles with a black frame and a light blue or teal accent on the nose bridge. His mouth is visible and open, and by the end, his beard and the area around his mouth are heavily coated in snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, captures the descent down a snowy mountain slope. The environment is blanketed in white snow, with scattered evergreen trees lining the sides of the run under an overcast sky. As the descent progresses, fresh powder snow sprays upwards, occasionally obscuring the person being filmed.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the medium shot and the main subject, it oversimplifies the spatial dynamics typical of a skiing video. The statement that the man is \"consistently centered\" is likely inaccurate; as he carves down the slope, he would probably shift from the center to the left and right within the frame, a key dynamic that is missing. The description of the slope as only in the \"background\" is also a simplification, as the terrain he is on constitutes the middle ground directly behind him before extending into the background. The caption could be improved by noting that the tips of his skis likely appear intermittently at the bottom of the frame, which would more clearly establish the source of the upward-spraying powder. Furthermore, instead of just stating that he \"descends,\" a more dynamic description would mention how the evergreen trees in the middle ground appear to move from the center of the frame toward the sides as he skis past them, which would better convey the speed and forward motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a dynamic medium shot of a man skiing down a snowy slope, with the camera positioned at his level. As he carves his way down, he shifts from the center to the left and right within the frame, adding a sense of movement and excitement. The slope he navigates forms the middle ground directly behind him, extending into the background. Evergreen trees flank the slope on both sides, appearing to move from the center toward the edges of the frame as he speeds past them under an overcast sky. The tips of his skis intermittently appear at the bottom of the frame, kicking up fresh powder snow that sprays upwards, sometimes partially obscuring the lower portion of the man and the immediate foreground. His ski poles occasionally come into view, enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene.",
