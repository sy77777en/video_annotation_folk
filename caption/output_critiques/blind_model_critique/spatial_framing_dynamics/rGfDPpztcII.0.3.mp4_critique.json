    "pre_caption": "The video maintains a medium shot of a man, who is consistently centered in the foreground. He is skiing down a snowy slope that occupies the background, stretching from the bottom to the top of the frame. Evergreen trees are visible in the middle ground to background on both the left and right sides of the slope, under an overcast sky at the top of the frame. One of his ski poles is occasionally visible in the left foreground. As he descends, fresh powder snow sprays upwards from the bottom of the frame, sometimes partially obscuring the lower portion of the man and the immediate foreground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man, seen from a very close, first-person perspective, likely from a camera mounted on his helmet. He is wearing a light-colored, possibly white and grey camouflage-patterned ski jacket. He has a prominent, light brown or reddish beard and mustache, which become increasingly covered in white snow as the video progresses. He wears a light blue or teal ski helmet with a orange logo and the text \"pecsports.com\" on the side, and a white sticker that says \"Be a HERO.\" His eyes are covered by large, orange-lensed ski goggles with a black frame and a light blue or teal accent on the nose bridge. His mouth is visible and open, and by the end, his beard and the area around his mouth are heavily coated in snow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A locked-on POV shot, where the camera is mounted to an object, captures the descent down a snowy mountain slope. The environment is blanketed in white snow, with scattered evergreen trees lining the sides of the run under an overcast sky. As the descent progresses, fresh powder snow sprays upwards, occasionally obscuring the person being filmed.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main elements, it could better capture the dynamic nature of the follow-shot. Stating the man is \"consistently centered\" is likely an oversimplification; in the video, he probably shifts slightly from left to right within the central third of the frame as he carves turns down the slope. The description of the background is also too static. Instead of the slope simply \"occupying\" the background, the visual reality is that the background scenery, including the evergreen trees, is constantly flowing past the skier and towards the camera, moving from the middle ground into the foreground before exiting the frame at the sides and bottom. This parallax effect is a key spatial dynamic that is currently missing. Furthermore, the description of the snow spray could be more specific; rather than just spraying upwards, the powder likely billows out in arcs corresponding to his turns, primarily filling the bottom left or bottom right of the frame depending on which way he is turning. Finally, while the shot is predominantly a medium shot, it's worth noting if his movements cause slight variations, momentarily making it a medium-long shot as he extends away or a medium-close shot as he comes nearer to the camera during a turn.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a dynamic follow-shot of a man skiing down a snowy slope, with the camera maintaining a medium shot that subtly shifts as he carves turns. The skier moves slightly from left to right within the central third of the frame, creating a sense of motion and energy. The background is alive with movement, as the snowy slope and evergreen trees flow past the skier, creating a parallax effect that enhances the spatial dynamics. The overcast sky looms above, while the skier's movements occasionally bring his ski poles into view. As he descends, fresh powder snow billows out in graceful arcs, filling the bottom left or right of the frame depending on his direction. The shot occasionally varies, transitioning to a medium-long shot as he extends away or a medium-close shot as he approaches the camera during a turn, adding to the visual engagement.",
