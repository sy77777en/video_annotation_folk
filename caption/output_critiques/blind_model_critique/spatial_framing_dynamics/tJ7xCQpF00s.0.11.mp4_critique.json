    "pre_caption": "This static, wide shot presents an eye-level, symmetrical view down a long subway platform. Rows of pillars line the left and right sides of the frame, extending from the foreground into the background and creating a strong vanishing point perspective. The platform itself occupies the bottom of the frame, leading into the distance, while an arched tunnel ceiling fills the top. In the center of the frame, a digital sign hangs in the middle ground. A few distant figures are positioned centrally on the platform, also in the middle ground and background. Station signs are attached to the pillars in the foreground on both the left and right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A scenic view of a subway platform captures the atmospheric essence, with silhouetted figures waiting for a train in the distance, all blending into the ambient lighting.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set on a long, straight platform of an underground subway station, identified by signs as the Monroe station on the Chicago Red Line. The view looks down the length of the platform, where a series of white, rectangular pillars on either side creates a strong vanishing point perspective under a white, arched tunnel ceiling. The environment is bathed in a cool, greenish-teal light from both overhead and side fluorescent fixtures. In the distance, a suspended digital sign glows with white text on a red background, indicating the directions of the trains on either side and the wait time for the next train. A few distant figures are visible on the otherwise empty platform, which has a dark floor marked by a blue safety line along the edge.**\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the spatial positions and movements of salient subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects, or describe all the spatial composition of all subjects collectively as a group if that is more appropriate.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the symmetrical composition and forward camera motion, but it misses key dynamic elements and misrepresents the positioning of the people. While it correctly notes the presence of distant figures, it incorrectly generalizes their position as central; one person is actually standing still near the pillars on the right in the middle ground, while another, much smaller figure in the background, is walking away from the camera toward the vanishing point. The most significant omission is the subway train itself, which enters the frame from the background on the right-side track, its headlights growing brighter as it moves toward the foreground, parallel to the camera's path. Additionally, the description of the camera's movement could be more specific by noting the parallax effect, where the foreground pillars glide past and out of the frame, which contrasts with the slower apparent movement of the background and enhances the sense of depth.",
