    "pre_caption": "In a close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center of the frame and the foreground. Initially, she is seen in profile, facing towards the left of the frame. She slowly turns her head towards the camera, transitioning into a three-quarter view while maintaining her central position. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman with her hair pulled back is shown in a dark setting, her profile illuminated by a red light. She is initially facing to her right, creating a silhouette that highlights the outline of her face and hair. She wears dark, high-collared clothing that merges with the black background. She slowly turns her head to face forward, though her features remain largely in shadow.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **Against a completely black and featureless background, the silhouette of a person is visible. A faint red light provides a subtle rim-lighting effect, outlining the profile of their head, hair pulled back, and the curve of their shoulder. The person's head slowly turns from a side view to a three-quarter profile within the dark space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject's central position and the basic head-turning motion, it lacks specificity and fails to fully describe the scene's depth. The description of the woman being in the \"foreground\" is incomplete without mentioning what constitutes the background; for instance, behind her is a softly blurred wall with indistinct geometric patterns, which is crucial for establishing the shallow depth of field. The term \"close-up\" is also too general; the shot is more accurately an extreme close-up, framing her from the top of her head to just below her chin, with her right shoulder barely visible in the bottom left corner. Furthermore, the description of her movement could be more precise. As she turns from a left-facing profile, her gaze doesn't just land in a \"three-quarter view\" but shifts across the frame to look just past the right side of the camera, a detail that more accurately captures the final spatial dynamic of the shot.",

As she slowly turns her head, her gaze shifts across the frame, ultimately looking just past the right side of the camera, transitioning into a three-quarter view while maintaining her central position.
