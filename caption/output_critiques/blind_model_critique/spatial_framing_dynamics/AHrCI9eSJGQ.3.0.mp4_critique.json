    "pre_caption": "This video is presented as a static, extreme wide scenery shot from a high-angle perspective. The foreground is filled by shipping containers that occupy the bottom half of the frame, forming a V-shape that recedes toward the center. The sea occupies the middle ground in the center of the frame, stretching to the horizon. In the background, a vast sky with fast-moving, time-lapsed clouds fills the top half of the screen, while a small, distant ship is visible in the center, on the horizon line. A text overlay is statically positioned in the bottom center of the frame, and a watermark is located in the bottom right corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic maritime scenery shot, captured from the bow of a massive container ship looking out over the open ocean. The foreground features stacked rows of red, blue, and orange shipping containers, which frame the expansive view ahead. The sea is calm, stretching to the horizon where a lone, distant vessel is faintly visible. Above, a vast, time-lapsed sky is filled with streaky, fast-moving clouds illuminated by a warm, golden-orange light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the ocean and the atmospheric, dynamic sky, making the vast environment itself the focus of the shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From the bow of a large container ship, the view looks out over a calm sea under a cloud-filled sky. Stacks of red, blue, and orange shipping containers are filling the foreground and extending toward the horizon. The sky is filled with fast-moving clouds, tinged with warm orange light. The water surface appears smooth and still. In the distance, the silhouette of another ship is visible on the horizon. An overlay in the bottom center displays white text that reads, \"The Straits have an established Traffic Separation Scheme. That is why most nearby ships are going in the same direction.\" In the bottom right corner, a red and white \"YouTube JEFFHK\" watermark is present.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately describes the static composition, including the extreme wide shot and the V-shape of the shipping containers in the foreground, it overlooks several key dynamic elements crucial to a time-lapse video. The description of the \"fast-moving, time-lapsed clouds\" lacks detail on their direction of movement, such as moving from left to right across the top of the frame. More significantly, the caption fails to mention the movement of the \"small, distant ship,\" which I imagine travels horizontally across the horizon from its initial position left of center, eventually exiting the frame on the right. The most prominent missing detail is the dynamic play of light and shadow; as the clouds move, their shadows would visibly sweep across the shipping containers and the sea, altering the visual texture of these surfaces. Finally, the description of the containers forming a \"V-shape that recedes toward the center\" could be more precise by specifying that the vertex of the V is near the bottom center, with the arms extending upwards and outwards into the middle ground.",
