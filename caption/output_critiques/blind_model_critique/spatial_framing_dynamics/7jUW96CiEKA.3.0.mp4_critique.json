    "pre_caption": "This is an extreme wide shot of a landscape. The foreground, occupying the bottom portion of the frame, consists of sandy ground with sparse vegetation and faint tracks. Stretching across the middle ground is a wide expanse of flat, dry terrain. In the background, a line of trees runs horizontally across the frame, positioned below the sky which fills the top half of the frame and features clouds with patches of blue. The camera is positioned low to the ground, looking across the landscape towards the horizon. The shot remains static throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a landscape scenery shot. It captures a vast, open expanse of dry, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, under a sky filled with a mix of clouds and patches of blue. The focus is on the expansive environment, emphasizing the scale and atmosphere of the scene rather than any specific object. The distant tree line and the wide, open sky contribute to the sense of vastness and tranquility.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video displays a wide, outdoor landscape under a cloudy daytime sky. The foreground consists of flat, light-brown sandy ground sparsely covered with small green plants and marked by faint tracks. In the distance, a horizontal line of green trees separates the ground from the sky, which is filled with predominantly white and grey clouds, with some areas of blue visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as an \"extreme wide shot\" of a landscape. The description of the scene's layers—foreground (sandy ground, vegetation, tracks), middle ground (flat terrain), and background (trees, sky)—is precise. The placement of these elements within the frame (bottom, middle, top half) is also described correctly.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally complete and fulfills all requirements of the instruction. It begins by specifying the shot size. It then systematically breaks down the scene into foreground, middle ground, and background, providing both the 3D depth and the 2D position for each element. It successfully describes the camera's low height relative to the scene and concludes by noting the static nature of the shot, covering the dynamics aspect.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to all instructions. It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids subjective or emotional language, focusing entirely on objective spatial framing. It makes no speculative statements and provides a clear, coherent description of the visual information. The structure is logical and easy to follow, making it an excellent example of the desired output.",
