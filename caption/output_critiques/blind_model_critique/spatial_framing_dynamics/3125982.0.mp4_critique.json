    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a woman performing push-ups. Initially, the camera focuses on her lower legs and feet, capturing her from the bottom left corner of the frame. As the sequence progresses, the camera pans upward, revealing more of her body in the center of the frame. Her hands, clad in fingerless gloves, are positioned in the foreground, while her torso and legs occupy the middle ground. The polished wooden floor serves as the background, extending across the entire frame. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. There are no significant changes in shot size or camera height, ensuring a steady view of the subject's movements. The transition from focusing on her lower legs to her full body occurs smoothly, keeping her central in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a woman engaged in a push-up exercise. She is wearing a dark sports bra and bright pink shorts, with fingerless gloves on her hands. Her skin tone is light, and her long hair is tied back. The focus is on her athletic posture, as she lowers and raises her body with her hands and feet supporting her movement. The scene emphasizes her physical activity and form.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a gym setting, with a focus on a person performing push-ups on a smooth, polished wooden floor. The lighting suggests daytime, with natural light streaming in and casting soft shadows across the floor, which has a warm, natural wood tone. The environment is spacious, and a large mirror is visible in the background, reflecting the dynamic atmosphere. The person is engaged in a workout, wearing athletic attire, including gloves and shorts, emphasizing activity and motion within the gym space.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is partially effective but has significant issues with accuracy and internal consistency, failing to fully adhere to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Contradiction in Shot Size:** The caption states it is a \"medium shot\" but also says there are \"no significant changes in shot size.\" However, it then describes a camera movement that starts on the \"lower legs and feet\" and pans up to reveal \"more of her body.\" This camera movement inherently changes the shot size from a tighter shot (like a close-up or medium close-up on the legs) to a wider one. The description of the action contradicts the summary statements.\n*   **Contradiction in Framing:** The caption claims the subject is initially in the \"bottom left corner\" but later says the transition keeps her \"central in the frame.\" Both cannot be true. If she starts in a corner and ends in the center, she does not remain central throughout.\n*   **Inaccurate Spatial Description:** Describing the \"polished wooden floor\" as the \"background\" is incorrect. The subject is on the floor, making the floor the ground plane that occupies the foreground and middle ground. The background would be what is behind her in the distance.\n\n**Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption attempts to cover all the required elements: shot size, 2D/3D position, camera height, and movement.\n*   However, it fails to clearly describe the transition as instructed. It should specify the initial shot size and the final shot size, rather than giving a single, static description that is contradicted by the described camera movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Clarity and Coherence:** The internal contradictions make the paragraph confusing and incoherent, which violates the core instruction to create a \"clear, concise, and coherent paragraph.\"\n*   **Style and Formatting:** The caption successfully uses simple English, avoids emotional or speculative language, and is formatted as a single paragraph without Markdown, which aligns with the instructions.\n*   **Goal:** It fails in its primary goal of accurately describing the \"spatial framing and dynamics\" due to the conflicting information provided.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up shot of a woman's lower legs and feet, positioned in the bottom left corner of the frame. As the camera smoothly pans upward, the shot size transitions to a medium shot, revealing her full body centered in the frame. Her hands, wearing fingerless gloves, are prominently displayed in the foreground, while her torso and legs occupy the middle ground. The polished wooden floor extends across the frame, serving as the ground plane. The camera maintains a consistent height at the subject's level, ensuring a steady view of her movements throughout the sequence. The transition from the initial close-up to the medium shot is seamless, effectively keeping her central in the frame by the end.",
