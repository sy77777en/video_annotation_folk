    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the sports car, capturing most of its body while it is in motion on a snowy surface. Initially, the car is positioned slightly off-center towards the left side of the frame, with its front facing the camera. The car occupies the foreground, with the snowy track and evergreen trees forming the background. As the video progresses, the shot transitions to a full shot, showing more of the car's surroundings. The camera moves from an initial position above the car to aligning at the car's level, providing a clearer view of its side profile. The car continues to move from left to right across the frame, maintaining its central position. The snowy track remains in the middle ground, while the trees stay in the background, creating depth in the scene. The camera captures the dynamic movement of the car as it kicks up snow, emphasizing its speed and the texture of the snowy surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme. The front of the car displays large numbers, \"+30°\" and \"-30°,\" prominently on the hood. The car's sleek design includes aerodynamic curves and a visible logo on the front. In the latter part of the video, the car is seen from the rear, showcasing its dynamic shape. The car is in motion, with snow being kicked up around it, indicating it is driving on a snowy surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a dynamic outdoor scene on a snowy track. It features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme, prominently displaying numbers and markings on its sleek, aerodynamic body. The setting is a wintry landscape with snow-covered ground and a backdrop of tall, dark evergreen trees. The time of day appears to be midday, with the sun casting a bright glow, creating a contrast between the car's vibrant colors and the white snow. The car is in motion, kicking up snow as it speeds along the track, emphasizing the sense of movement and energy in the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned above the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is a good attempt but has several key areas for improvement regarding accuracy, adherence to instructions, and clarity.\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Contradictory Movement:** The most significant issue is a contradiction in the description of the car's movement. The caption states the car \"continues to move from left to right across the frame\" while also \"maintaining its central position.\" These two descriptions are mutually exclusive. A car moving *across the frame* implies a static camera, while a car *maintaining its central position* implies the camera is tracking or panning with it. This must be corrected to accurately describe the action.\n*   **Vague 3D Positioning:** The description of the \"snowy track\" as being in the \"middle ground\" is an oversimplification. The track exists under the car in the foreground and extends into the middle ground and background. A more accurate description would acknowledge this.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Good Coverage:** The caption successfully covers most of the required elements: initial and final shot size, 2D and 3D position, camera height, and changes in these elements.\n*   **Missing Transition Detail:** The caption uses the word \"transitions\" to describe the change from a medium to a full shot. The instructions ask to specify the type of transition (e.g., hard cut, zoom out). Based on the description of the camera also moving downwards, it sounds like a continuous camera movement (a crane down and pull back) rather than a cut, which should be stated more clearly.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violates \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives/Interpretation\":** The final sentence, \"The camera captures the dynamic movement of the car as it kicks up snow, emphasizing its speed and the texture of the snowy surface,\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective language. \"Dynamic movement\" is borderline, but \"emphasizing its speed\" is an interpretation of the shot's effect, not a description of its spatial properties.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The contradictory statement about the car's movement makes the paragraph incoherent. The final sentence is also somewhat redundant and interpretive, detracting from the concise, factual goal.\n\n### Revised Example (for illustration)\n\nHere is how the caption could be revised to better follow the instructions, assuming the camera tracks the car:\n\nA medium shot frames a sports car from above as it moves on a snowy surface, positioned in the left-center of the frame and occupying the foreground. In the background are a snowy track and evergreen trees. The camera simultaneously pans right and lowers its height to track the car, causing the shot to widen into a full shot. During this movement, the car remains in the center of the frame, moving toward the right, while its side profile becomes visible. The snowy track passes through the foreground and middle ground, and the trees remain in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot captures a sports car from above as it moves on a snowy surface, positioned slightly left of center in the frame and occupying the foreground. In the background, a snowy track extends from the foreground into the middle ground, with evergreen trees further back. The camera pans right and lowers its height to track the car, transitioning into a full shot. Throughout this movement, the car stays centered in the frame, moving toward the right, revealing its side profile. The snowy track continues through the foreground and middle ground, while the trees remain in the background.",
