    "pre_caption": "The video is a medium shot. A man is positioned slightly left of center in the frame and in the middle ground, looking downwards and slightly to his right. He holds a book in his right hand, which is also in the center-left middle ground. A blurred pink shower cap is in the bottom right foreground. In the background, a shower curtain is visible to the right, and a plain wall is to the left. The camera is positioned at the subject's level. The shot is static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, light-skinned man with medium-length, reddish-brown hair is depicted from the waist up, looking downwards and slightly to his right with his mouth open. He has white foam or suds arranged on his hair like a cap, and more foam on his chin and upper lip, resembling a beard and mustache. He wears a white, short-sleeved collared shirt and a dark tie with lighter diagonal stripes. In his right hand, he holds a dark-covered book with the title \"Vigils Chronicle\" printed in gold foil lettering. In the blurred foreground, a pink shower cap in motion, featuring a white button in the center, is visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in what appears to be a bathroom, viewed from a low angle looking upwards. A light-colored shower curtain with a green and white leaf or feather-like pattern is visible in the background, slightly to the right of center. The wall behind is a plain, light, possibly beige or off-white color. The lighting is diffuse, illuminating the scene from above and slightly to the side.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but misses the opportunity to fully detail the spatial transformation caused by the zoom. It correctly identifies the initial framing as a medium shot but should specify the final shot size, for example, a medium close-up, to clarify the extent of the zoom. A more detailed description would explain how the man's framing evolves; as the camera moves in, his upper torso and the book he is holding would occupy a much larger portion of the frame, shifting from being just left of center to dominating the central space. The caption also treats the foreground and background elements statically. It should describe how the zoom impacts them, noting that the blurred pink shower cap in the bottom right foreground is likely pushed further to the edge or even partially out of frame, while the background shower curtain and wall become more cropped and less visible. Lastly, a small detail, such as mentioning if the book is open or closed, would add precision to the man's action of looking down.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium shot. A man is positioned slightly left of center in the frame and in the middle ground, looking downwards and slightly to his right. He holds an open book in his right hand, which is also in the center-left middle ground. As the camera zooms in, the shot transitions to a medium close-up, with the man's upper torso and the book occupying a larger portion of the frame, shifting to dominate the central space. The blurred pink shower cap in the bottom right foreground is pushed further to the edge or partially out of frame. In the background, the shower curtain and plain wall become more cropped and less visible. The camera remains at the subject's level throughout the static shot.",
