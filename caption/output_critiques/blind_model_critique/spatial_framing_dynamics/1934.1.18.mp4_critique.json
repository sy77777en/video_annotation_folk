    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of four individuals in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a central screen. The camera is positioned at the subjects' level, capturing them from the waist up. Three individuals are positioned in the foreground, closely grouped together, with two on the left side of the frame and one on the right. Their 2D positions are left-center and right-center, respectively, while their 3D positions place them in the foreground. The fourth individual, distinguished by a red top hat, stands slightly apart and elevated in the frame, located towards the top right in 2D space and in the middle ground in 3D space. The screen they observe is centrally placed in the background, displaying a small white silhouette against a black backdrop. There are no noticeable changes in shot size or spatial positioning throughout the sequence. The overall spatial framing emphasizes the group's focus on the screen, with the individual in the red top hat maintaining a distinct position within the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a group of four individuals, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of the individuals, distinguishable by a red top hat, stands slightly apart and appears slightly elevated in the frame. The screen they are observing displays a small, white silhouette of a person. The individuals are closely focused on the screen, suggesting an interest or engagement with the content displayed. The scene conveys a sense of uniformity and attention among the group.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a white room with a minimalist design. The environment is dominated by a large, central monitor displaying a small, white figure against a black background. The scene features several individuals dressed in white, full-body suits with head coverings, gathered around the monitor. One person stands out with a red top hat, adding a splash of color to the otherwise monochromatic setting. The atmosphere is clinical and focused, with the group intently observing the screen. The lighting is bright and even, enhancing the clean and orderly appearance of the room.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and their general placement, it oversimplifies the spatial dynamics and misses key details. The description of the scene as static is inaccurate; the small white silhouette on the central background screen is not stationary but slowly rotates, and the heads of the three foreground individuals subtly track this movement, which is a crucial dynamic element. The positioning of the fourth individual is also described imprecisely; he is not just \"elevated\" but is standing on a distinct, grated platform in the middle ground, positioning his upper body above the heads of the foreground group. Furthermore, the statement that three individuals are \"facing away\" is not entirely correct, as the person on the far left is in a three-quarter view, occasionally turning their head slightly towards the person beside them. Lastly, the caption fails to mention the out-of-focus control panels that occupy the bottom fifth of the frame in the immediate foreground, which adds another layer of depth and establishes the setting more clearly.",
