    "pre_caption": "In a low-angle medium shot, six silhouetted figures are positioned in the foreground and middle ground, surrounding the camera's low viewpoint. Several figures are located on the left and right sides of the frame in the foreground, with others positioned slightly behind them in the middle ground. In the background, tall trees extend from the bottom of the frame upwards across the scene, silhouetted against the blue sky at the top. A bright sun in the bottom center-right background creates a prominent lens flare that washes out the center of the image, and a reddish light leak is visible along the top right edge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a low-angle perspective, six silhouetted figures are visible among tall, thin trees against a bright blue sky with a glaring sun. The second figure on the left, initially seen in a blurry close-up, has a human form with what appears to be long hair or a headdress and is wearing brownish-yellow pants with a grey top. The first figure on the right appears to be carrying a large backpack or bulky gear on its back. The other figures are dressed mostly in blue, grey, and white. The surrounding trees are mostly bare, with some having sparse leaves, and their branches all reaching upward.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a low-angle perspective looking up through a forest of tall, slender trees with sparse leaves, the scene is set against a clear blue sky during the daytime. The bright sun is positioned in the bottom center-right of the frame, creating a significant lens flare that washes out a portion of the view with intense white light. A reddish-purple light leak is visible along the right edge. Six figures are running away from the camera from either side, partially obscuring the view.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the low-angle wide shot and the presence of six silhouetted figures. However, the description of their movement, \"gradually come into view from both sides,\" is vague; it could be improved by specifying their entry points, such as entering from the bottom-left and bottom-right corners. The caption also neglects to describe their final spatial arrangement in the middle ground—for example, if they form a horizontal line or a central cluster. The description of the trees is confusing, as they cannot be in the \"middle ground to background\" while also extending \"from the bottom of the frame\"; it would be more accurate to describe their trunks as being in the foreground and middle ground. Finally, while the lens flare is mentioned, its specific characteristics, like its shape or any radiating streaks, are omitted, and the caption fails to describe the ground plane (e.g., a grassy field) on which the figures are moving, which is a crucial element for understanding the scene's depth and composition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a low-angle wide shot, six silhouetted figures gradually come into view, entering from the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the frame. They move towards the middle ground, forming a horizontal line across the scene. In the foreground and middle ground, the trunks of tall trees rise from the ground, extending upwards and silhouetted against the blue sky. The bright sun in the bottom center-right background creates a prominent lens flare with radiating streaks, washing out the center of the image. A reddish light leak is visible along the top right edge. The figures move across a grassy field, adding depth and context to the composition.",
