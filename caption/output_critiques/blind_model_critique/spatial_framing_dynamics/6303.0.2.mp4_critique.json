    "pre_caption": "The video presents a static wide shot capturing the interior of a laundromat. The checkered floor occupies the bottom portion of the frame in the middle ground. Washing machines are visible along the left and right walls, extending from the middle ground into the background. Two individuals are positioned in the middle ground; one is seated slightly left of the center, while the other stands slightly right of the center. Large, pink text reading \"KODAK ONHA\" is superimposed prominently in the central foreground, partially covering the two people. The camera is positioned above the subjects, providing a high-angle view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wide shot of a laundry room with two people at the center. One person, a man, is seated on a bench, wearing a green shirt, light-colored pants, and white headphones, with a relaxed posture. The other person, standing nearby, is holding a laundry basket and wearing a dark outfit. The room has a checkered floor and several washing machines along the walls. Pink text reading \"KODAK ONHA\" appears prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the people, and seems to be added in post-production.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor laundromat setting with a checkered black-and-white tile floor and vibrant blue walls. The room contains several washing machines with circular doors, some of which have green-tinted windows. The lighting is bright, with overhead fluorescent fixtures. Notable visual elements include large, pink, amorphous shapes that appear to float in the air, adding a surreal quality to the scene. These shapes are smooth and glossy, contrasting with the structured environment. Overlay elements include large, pink, balloon-like text positioned prominently in the center of the scene.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of a laundry room with two people in the center, the pink text title \"KODAK ONHA\" shows up and covers part of two people, which was added in post-production.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the checkered floor as being only in the middle ground; in the video, the floor pattern clearly extends from the immediate foreground at the bottom of the frame to the background, creating a strong sense of perspective. While the shot is described as static, this is misleading as the standing individual on the right is actively loading clothes into a washing machine, a key movement that defines their position and purpose in the scene. The description of the two individuals is too general; it omits that the seated person on the left is leaning forward, looking at a phone, while the standing person is positioned with their back to the camera. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention a prominent yellow laundry basket in the bottom-left foreground, which is a key element for establishing depth, and it also misses the row of dryers visible in the deep background, which balances the composition against the washing machines.",
