    "pre_caption": "This close-up shot is framed by dark, out-of-focus car interior elements in the foreground, positioned on the left and right sides of the frame. In the middle ground, a vertical black bar with visible stitching is located in the center of the frame, with a small orange light visible just to its right. The background consists of bright, overexposed car windows, with a larger one on the right and a smaller one visible on the left, creating a distinct sense of depth. The camera, positioned at the subject's level, maintains a mostly static position with a very subtle, slight shake.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up, stylized view from inside a vehicle highlights a black, vertical bar, likely part of a roll cage. The bar has a textured surface with a visible seam of stitching running down its length. The shot is framed by the dark, out-of-focus shapes of the car's interior, possibly the seats or pillars, which have a strong green tint. Through the car's windows, the outside is a bright, overexposed white expanse. A small, glowing orange interior light is visible in the middle ground.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From inside a vehicle, the view is framed by dark, out-of-focus interior elements with a greenish tint. A central, vertical black bar, part of a roll cage, is in focus, revealing a textured surface with a line of stitching running down its length. Through the car's side and rear windows, a bright, overexposed daytime scene is visible. A small, glowing orange light is also present within the dark interior of the car.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and adheres meticulously to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its spatial description. It correctly identifies the shot size as a \"close-up\" and precisely maps out the scene's depth by distinguishing between foreground (out-of-focus car interior), middle ground (vertical bar and light), and background (overexposed windows).\n*   The 2D positioning of elements (left, right, center) is described correctly and clearly.\n*   The description of the camera's height (\"at the subject's level\") and movement (\"mostly static position with a very subtle, slight shake\") is precise and accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully incorporates all the required elements: shot size, 2D position, 3D depth, camera height, and dynamics.\n*   It provides a comprehensive spatial analysis of the scene, describing the framing elements and the main subject within the frame.\n*   It correctly notes the lack of significant movement, fulfilling the instruction to describe any changes or dynamics.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"dark,\" \"out-of-focus,\" and \"bright\" are used as objective visual descriptors).\n*   **No Speculation:** The description is factual and avoids any speculative or ambiguous language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Focus:** The caption remains strictly focused on the **spatial framing and dynamics**, as requested, without deviating into narrative or interpretation.",
