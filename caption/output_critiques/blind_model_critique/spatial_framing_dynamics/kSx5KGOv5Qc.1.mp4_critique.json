    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a coastal landscape, captured from a high angle. The shot is primarily focused on the scenery, with no single main subject. Initially, a rocky hillside with green trees occupies the foreground at the bottom of the frame. The middle ground features the deep blue sea, with a large, forested island in the upper-left to center and a walled city with terracotta roofs in the bottom right. A large cruise ship is visible in the middle ground to the left. The camera slowly pans to the right and tilts slightly down. This movement shifts the walled city and its harbor to the center and right of the frame, while the island moves to the top left. The foreground hillside expands to fill more of the bottom of the frame, and a tower structure appears in the bottom right corner by the end of the shot. A watermark is consistently positioned in the top left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a sweeping panoramic landscape and cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high vantage point on a rocky, pine-dotted hillside. The view encompasses a historic walled city with a dense cluster of terracotta-roofed buildings nestled on a peninsula, complete with a bustling harbor filled with boats. Beyond the city lies the deep blue expanse of the sea, where a large, verdant island sits prominently offshore, accompanied by a few scattered boats, including a large ship and several smaller boats. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the grand scale and picturesque setting of the location. The focus is on the harmonious composition of the natural and man-made elements. The camera's slow pan across the vista emphasizes the expansive environment rather than a specific entity.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high, rocky vantage point, the video pans slowly to the right across a scenic coastal landscape in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on a clear day. The deep blue Adriatic Sea fills the view, with the large, green, forested island of Lokrum situated prominently offshore. A white cruise ship and several smaller boats are visible on the water's surface. As the camera moves, it reveals the historic walled city, a dense cluster of buildings with orange-red terracotta roofs, enclosed by massive, light-colored stone walls. A harbor with numerous docked boats is nestled against the city. The foreground is a rugged hillside with green pine trees and rocky, brown earth. A watermark for 'Xscion.org' with the word 'COPYRIGHT' is visible as an overlay in the top left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the extreme wide shot and the camera's pan-and-tilt movement, its spatial descriptions could be more precise. The initial placement of the walled city in the \"bottom right\" seems unlikely for a balanced composition; \"middle-right\" or simply \"on the right\" would be more plausible, giving it more prominence from the start. The description omits the background entirely, which would likely consist of the sky and a distant horizon line above the sea. Furthermore, while the cruise ship is noted, a video of this nature would probably feature smaller boats or watercraft moving in the sea around the city and ship, a dynamic detail that is currently missing. The final appearance of the \"tower structure\" could be better integrated by specifying its connection to the foreground hillside, for example, as a ruin or watchtower situated on the slope. Lastly, the description of the camera's movement could be enhanced by explaining its effect on the perspective, such as how the view of the walled city transitions from a more oblique angle to a slightly more direct overhead view as it moves to the center of the frame.",
