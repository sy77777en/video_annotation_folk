    "pre_caption": "This static wide shot of the scenery is framed with a large, light-colored stone pillar in the foreground, vertically dividing the composition. On the left side of the frame, a stone balustrade occupies the foreground from the bottom left, with a modern sculpture of white spires and a dark building visible in the middle ground against a partly cloudy sky. On the right side, a sidewalk begins in the foreground and recedes into the distance, adjacent to a wide road in the middle ground. A traffic light stands in the foreground on the far right. Further in the middle ground on the right, the Victoria Memorial is visible, with Buckingham Palace situated in the background behind it. A white logo is positioned in the bottom right corner. The camera is positioned at approximately eye level, looking straight ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing an iconic view in London. The composition is split by a large, light-colored stone pillar in the foreground, creating a striking contrast between two scenes. To the left, a stone balustrade with multiple spires stands against a partly cloudy sky, and next to the balustrade, there is an upright frame displaying a photograph. To the right, a sun-drenched, empty road stretches towards the majestic Buckingham Palace in the distance, with the golden-winged statue of the Victoria Memorial visible before it. There is no main subject, as the expansive perspective is designed to emphasize the architectural grandeur and the atmosphere of the famous location, focusing on the sense of place rather than a particular person or object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This daytime, outdoor scene in London is framed by a large, light-colored stone pillar in the center. To the right, a sidewalk extends towards the Victoria Memorial, a white marble monument topped with a gilded statue, with the grand facade of Buckingham Palace visible in the background. A wide road and a traffic light on a pole occupy the right side of the view. On the left, there is a stone balustrade adorned with numerous spires standing against a partly cloudy sky, and to the left of the balustrade, an upright frame displaying photographs is visible. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds. An overlay consisting of a white logo is visible in the bottom right corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key landmarks and camera movements, but it could improve its description of the spatial dynamics during the pan. The statement that the balustrade on the left side \"starts from the bottom right\" is confusing; it likely begins near the bottom center and extends leftward. The description treats the left and right sides of the frame as static entities, failing to describe how their positions shift relative to the frame during the leftward pan. For instance, it should note that as the camera pans, the Victoria Memorial moves from the right side toward the center. The caption also omits any mention of dynamic elements like pedestrians on the sidewalk or cars on the road, which are highly likely in this location and are crucial to describing the scene's full spatial dynamics. Finally, the purpose of the final \"moving slightly forward\" action is unclear; the caption should specify what element the camera moves toward, for example, the modern sculptures, to provide a more complete sense of the shot's concluding focus.",
