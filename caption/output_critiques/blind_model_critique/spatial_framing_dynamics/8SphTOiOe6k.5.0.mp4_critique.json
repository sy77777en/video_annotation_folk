    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a Japanese street scene. A prominent traditional-style building occupies the center-right portion of the frame, situated primarily in the middle ground and extending slightly into the background. To its right, in the foreground and middle ground, stands a maple tree with red leaves. The street and sidewalk stretch across the bottom of the frame, occupying the foreground and middle ground. Various groups of people populate the scene: schoolgirls are clustered in the center-left middle ground near the building's entrance, two women in kimonos stand in the center-right middle ground near shop displays, and other pedestrians walk along the street in the left foreground and middle ground. Other buildings line the street in the left middle ground and background, while distant hills are visible in the top-left background. The camera remains static, maintaining this wide shot composition from approximately eye level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot. It captures a bustling street scene with traditional architecture, featuring wooden buildings with tiled roofs. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the cultural setting rather than a specific object. People are seen walking and interacting, some wearing traditional attire, which adds to the vibrant and lively ambiance. The presence of colorful signage and displays outside shops further emphasizes the dynamic urban environment. The overall composition showcases the blend of tradition and modernity, creating a rich, immersive experience.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot captures an outdoor street scene in a Japanese town during the daytime. On the right, a traditional Japanese-style building with a dark grey tiled roof and wooden upper facade houses a shop with large glass windows and signage in Japanese. A maple tree with vibrant red leaves stands near the building's corner. Several groups of people are present on the paved street and sidewalk: schoolgirls in dark uniforms gather near the shop entrance, two women in patterned red kimonos stand around the display signs, and other pedestrians, some wearing face masks, walk along the street. The sky appears overcast.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their static positions, it significantly under-describes the spatial dynamics of the moving people, which are a key element of the scene. The description \"pedestrians walk along the street\" is too general; in the video, their movement creates a clear flow. For instance, a continuous stream of people moves from the left middle ground toward the right foreground, while a smaller group walks away from the camera down the center of the street, shrinking as they recede into the background. The caption also misses the subtle movements within the stationary groups; the schoolgirls are not just clustered but are actively gesturing and shifting their weight, creating small spatial changes in the center-left, and the women in kimonos periodically turn to face the shop displays, altering their profiles relative to the camera. Furthermore, the description of the maple tree as \"standing\" to the right is slightly misleading; it is a large branch with dense red leaves that enters from the top-right of the frame, acting as a foreground framing device rather than a complete tree standing in the scene.",
