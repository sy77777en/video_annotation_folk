    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a dense forest, capturing an expansive view of the natural environment. The camera remains stationary throughout, maintaining a consistent perspective. In the foreground, elements such as moss-covered rocks and fallen branches occupy the bottom left and right areas of the frame, while a narrow dirt path meanders through the middle ground, extending from the bottom left towards the center. Tall trees with textured bark and vibrant green foliage dominate the background, filling the upper portion of the frame and creating a canopy that filters sunlight. The camera's height is slightly elevated, offering a clear view of the forest floor and the surrounding vegetation. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning of elements within the scene, preserving the serene and untouched atmosphere of the forest throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the forest's atmosphere and scale. There is no main subject because the emphasis is on the overall beauty and tranquility of the forest setting, rather than a specific object.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video, captured from a drone POV, showcases a lush, dense forest setting during daylight. Tall trees with textured bark and vibrant green foliage dominate the scene, creating a canopy that filters sunlight onto the forest floor. The ground is covered with a mix of moss, rocks, and fallen branches, adding texture and depth. A narrow dirt path winds through the trees, with a small stream flowing into the distance on the left side of the path, suggesting a natural trail. The overall atmosphere is serene and untouched, with the drone's perspective providing a sweeping view of the forest's expanse and intricate details.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is very good but has one specific flaw.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a dense forest, the shot size as a wide shot, and accurately describes the spatial placement of key elements like rocks, branches, the path, and trees within the foreground, middle ground, and background. The description of the camera's height and stationary nature is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully addresses all the required components from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** \"wide shot\"\n*   **Position (2D/3D):** It effectively maps out the scene, placing \"moss-covered rocks and fallen branches\" in the \"foreground\" at the \"bottom left and right,\" the \"dirt path\" in the \"middle ground\" from \"bottom left towards the center,\" and \"tall trees\" in the \"background\" in the \"upper portion.\"\n*   **Height:** It correctly notes the \"slightly elevated\" camera height.\n*   **Changes:** It explicitly states that the camera is \"stationary\" and there are \"no significant changes.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to almost all instructions, using simple language and a single-paragraph format. However, it violates one key negative constraint:\n\n*   **Violation:** The final phrase, \"preserving the serene and untouched atmosphere of the forest,\" directly contradicts the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The words \"serene\" and \"untouched\" describe a feeling or an interpretation of the scene, not its objective spatial characteristics.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is excellent in its detailed and accurate spatial analysis. To be perfect, it must remove the final subjective phrase. Simply ending the caption at \"...within the scene\" would make it fully compliant with all instructions.",
