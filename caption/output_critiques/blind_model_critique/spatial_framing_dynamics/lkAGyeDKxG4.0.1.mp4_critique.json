    "pre_caption": "In a full shot, a man is positioned in the middle ground, walking from the left side of the frame toward the right. The camera, positioned at his level, tracks laterally with his movement, keeping him relatively centered. Dark, silhouetted tree trunks occupy the immediate foreground on the left and right, sliding past the frame as the camera moves and creating a sense of depth. In the background, a distant mountain range is visible in the upper center of the frame against a glowing sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a man with a medium build and light skin, wearing a dark jacket, dark pants, and a beanie. He carries a backpack and is holding hiking poles, seen walking upright, facing in his forward direction. His posture and equipment suggest he is engaged in hiking or trekking.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a mountainous, wooded area at either dawn or dusk. Dark, silhouetted tree trunks with sparse, autumnal branches dominate the foreground. A distant mountain range with snow-capped peaks is visible against a sky that glows with a warm, yellow-orange light near the horizon. The viewpoint moves laterally, causing the foreground trees to shift and blur slightly against the static mountain backdrop.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the primary action and spatial layers, but it could be more precise about the dynamic relationships between the elements. While 'full shot' is a plausible description, if the man's feet are obscured by uneven ground or low foliage, 'medium-long shot' would be more accurate. The phrase 'relatively centered' is slightly vague; the description could be strengthened by specifying if the man's position shifts within the central third of the frame as he walks. The movement of the foreground trees is well-noted, but the caption could further detail this parallax effect by mentioning if the right side of the frame opens up compositionally as the trees there exit. Additionally, the description of the mountain range as being in the 'upper center' seems restrictive; a range would likely span the entire width of the background. Finally, the caption omits the surface the man is walking on—such as a dirt path or grassy field—which is a key spatial element connecting the foreground and middle ground and defining his trajectory more clearly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a medium-long shot, a man walks from the left side of the frame toward the right, his feet occasionally obscured by uneven ground or low foliage. The camera, positioned at his level, tracks laterally with his movement, keeping him within the central third of the frame as he progresses. Dark, silhouetted tree trunks occupy the immediate foreground on the left and right, sliding past the frame and enhancing the sense of depth. As the camera moves, the right side of the frame opens up compositionally, revealing more of the background. A distant mountain range spans the entire width of the background against a glowing sky. The man walks along a dirt path, which connects the foreground and middle ground, clearly defining his trajectory.",
