    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a high-angle close-up shot of a hand in the center-right foreground placing a digital voice recorder in the center of the frame onto a light-colored surface. The hand then retracts toward the top right and exits the frame. The shot transitions to a wider full shot, leaving the recorder positioned in the center of the frame on the surface, which now occupies the middle ground. A dark object is visible in the bottom-left foreground, while the camera maintains its fixed high-angle position throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **In a dimly lit scene, a hand with a light skin tone places a small, black digital voice recorder on a light-colored surface. The device is already on, with a small red light illuminated and the digital screen displaying a running timer. The hand then pulls away, leaving the activated recorder on the surface.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark room, a hand reaches into the frame and places a small, black digital voice recorder onto a smooth, light-colored surface. The device's small screen is illuminated, displaying white text and numbers. After setting it down, the hand withdraws, leaving the active recorder sitting alone on the tabletop in the dim light.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main action and the shift in shot size, it could be more precise about the visual dynamics and terminology. The term \"full shot\" is generally used for human subjects and is ambiguous here; a \"medium shot\" of the tabletop would more accurately describe the framing after the transition. The caption states \"the shot transitions\" but fails to specify how—a crucial detail. For instance, describing it as a smooth zoom-out would paint a clearer picture of the continuous change in framing, where the recorder and surface recede from the foreground into the middle ground. Furthermore, the description of the \"dark object\" is too generic; a more specific detail, such as \"the dark corner of a notebook\" or \"a black rectangular object,\" would enhance the spatial composition without speculating. Finally, the initial action could be described more dynamically; the hand doesn't just place the recorder in the center, it moves it from the center-right to the center, a subtle but important movement within the frame.",
