    "pre_caption": "The video presents a full shot of a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, moving across a minimalist stage. Initially, he stands on a raised black platform located in the upper center of the frame, with the camera positioned below him. He begins his movement by stepping off the platform, transitioning from the top center towards the middle of the frame. As he descends, the camera shifts to match his level, maintaining a full shot. He continues his motion, moving horizontally across the stage from the center towards the left side. The large panel on the left side of the frame remains static in the background throughout the sequence. The subject's dynamic movement contrasts sharply with the static elements of the stage, emphasizing his actions against the stark black backdrop. The camera maintains a consistent horizontal angle, capturing the subject's fluid transition from the raised platform to the lower stage area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, including a long-sleeved shirt, pants, gloves, and a cap, with a light skin tone.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video showcases an indoor setting with a minimalist stage design. The environment features a stark black backdrop, creating a dramatic contrast with the subject dressed in a white outfit, complete with a cap and gloves. The stage includes a raised platform and a large panel on the left side, contributing to the abstract aesthetic. The bright lighting emphasizes the contrast between the subject and the dark background. As the scene progresses, the subject moves from the higher black platform to a lower one. The overall scene is devoid of additional props or furniture, focusing on the simplicity and visual impact of the contrasting colors and shapes.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a full shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned below the subject. It then changes to at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has some significant flaws regarding adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its description of spatial elements. It correctly identifies the shot size, the subject's initial and subsequent positions, the camera's height and movement, and the placement of background elements.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the required components from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** \"full shot\" is stated at the beginning.\n    *   **Position (2D/3D):** It effectively uses terms like \"upper center\" (2D), \"left side\" (2D), and \"background\" (3D).\n    *   **Height:** It notes the camera is initially \"below him\" and then \"shifts to match his level.\"\n    *   **Changes:** It clearly describes the subject's movement (\"transitioning from the top center towards the middle,\" \"moving horizontally... towards the left side\") and the corresponding camera shift.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\nThis is where the caption falls short. While it follows the structural requirements, it violates several key negative constraints.\n\n*   **Violation: Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.**\n    The caption uses several subjective words that describe the quality or feel of the scene rather than its objective spatial reality.\n    *   **\"minimalist stage\"**: \"Minimalist\" is an interpretive, stylistic adjective. A more neutral description would be \"a stage with a black backdrop.\"\n    *   **\"dynamic movement\"**: \"Dynamic\" describes the quality of the movement, not the movement itself.\n    *   **\"stark black backdrop\"**: \"Stark\" is a subjective descriptor.\n    *   **\"fluid transition\"**: \"Fluid\" is a subjective judgment on the quality of the subject's motion.\n\n*   **Violation: Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain (Interpretive Statements).**\n    The second-to-last sentence is almost entirely interpretive analysis, explaining the *effect* of the composition rather than the composition itself.\n    *   **\"The subject's dynamic movement contrasts sharply with the static elements of the stage, emphasizing his actions against the stark black backdrop.\"**: This sentence explains the artistic effect (\"contrasts sharply,\" \"emphasizing his actions\"). The instructions require a description of spatial framing, not a critical analysis of the cinematography's purpose.\n\n### Summary:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It correctly identifies and sequences all the required spatial information (shot size, position, depth, height, and movement).\n*   The structure is logical and easy to follow.\n*   It successfully describes the spatial relationship between the subject, the camera, and other elements in the scene.\n\n**Where the caption needs improvement:**\n*   It needs to be stripped of all subjective adjectives (\"minimalist,\" \"dynamic,\" \"stark,\" \"fluid\") and interpretive analysis (\"contrasts sharply,\" \"emphasizing his actions\"). The goal is a purely objective, geometric description of the scene. The last two sentences, in particular, add subjective commentary rather than new spatial information.\n\nIn conclusion, the caption is a good foundation but fails to strictly adhere to the constraints against subjectivity and interpretation. A better caption would present the same spatial facts without the analytical and qualitative language.",
