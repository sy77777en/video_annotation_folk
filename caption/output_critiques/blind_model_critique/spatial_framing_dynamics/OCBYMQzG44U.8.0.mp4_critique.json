    "pre_caption": "This video is a wide scenery shot with no main subjects, focusing on the environment. Initially, the camera is positioned at a low angle, looking forward from the bottom of the frame where dark water occupies the foreground. A short flight of tiled stairs rises from the water in the center middle ground, leading up towards a hazy, brightly lit corridor entrance in the center background. The camera then moves forward and upward, ascending the stairs as the water recedes from view. Upon reaching the top, the perspective continues to move rapidly forward down the center of a long, tiled corridor. This corridor is lined with glowing, oval-shaped lights on the left and right walls, stretching from the middle ground into the background and drawing the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway located at the center of the far end of the tunnel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video features a surreal architectural scenery shot, capturing a forward-moving perspective through a long, narrow corridor. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all uniformly covered in small, white square tiles, creating a sterile and disorienting grid that extends into the distance. The sequence begins at the base of a short flight of tiled stairs partially submerged in dark, murky water. As the perspective moves forward and goes upstairs, the water recedes to reveal the full length of the brightly lit, hazy tunnel. Further down the corridor, a series of glowing, oval-shaped lights or windows line the walls, leading the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway at the very end. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on conveying the strange, dreamlike atmosphere of the environment itself.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, moves rapidly through a surreal, indoor environment. The scene begins by emerging from dark, murky water at the bottom of a set of stairs. The camera ascends the stairs and then enters a long, narrow corridor. The walls, ceiling, floor, and stairs are all covered in a grid of small, square, white tiles. The corridor is brightly illuminated by a series of glowing, oval-shaped windows or lights lining the walls. At the far end of the brightly lit tunnel is a dark, rectangular doorway.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its spatial description. It correctly identifies the key elements (water, stairs, corridor, lights, doorway) and precisely describes their 2D positions (center, bottom, left, right) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background). The description of the camera's movement and the resulting changes in perspective is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete and covers all the required points from the instructions. It specifies the shot size (\"wide scenery shot\"), the initial camera height (\"low angle\"), the spatial positions of all major elements, and the full trajectory of the camera's movement (\"moves forward and upward... continues to move rapidly forward\"). It successfully captures the entire spatial dynamic of the video from start to finish.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres strictly to the guidelines.\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, using factual descriptors like \"tiled,\" \"oval-shaped,\" and \"rectangular.\"\n*   It avoids speculation and focuses only on what is visible.\n*   It correctly follows the structure by first establishing the initial framing and then clearly describing the spatial transitions and movements.\n*   It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and focuses on the environmental framing and camera dynamics as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents a wide scenery shot that emphasizes the environment without a main subject. It begins with the camera positioned at a low angle, capturing a view from the bottom of the frame where dark water fills the foreground. A short flight of tiled stairs ascends from the water in the center middle ground, leading to a hazy, brightly lit corridor entrance in the center background. The camera then advances forward and upward, climbing the stairs as the water fades from view. Upon reaching the top, the perspective swiftly moves forward down the center of a long, tiled corridor. This corridor is lined with glowing, oval-shaped lights on both the left and right walls, extending from the middle ground into the background and guiding the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway at the center of the tunnel's far end.",
