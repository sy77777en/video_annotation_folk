    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot centers on a woman's face, positioning her in the foreground and the middle of the frame. The background is entirely dark and out of focus. The camera remains static at the woman's eye level throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A close-up shot reveals a woman's face, illuminated by a strong red light that saturates the scene. She has light-colored, wavy hair framing her face. Her eyes are wide open, with large, dark pupils, and she stares directly forward with a tense, unblinking expression. Her mouth is closed, and her pale-toned skin is completely tinted by the red light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A person's face is captured in a tight close-up, bathed in a saturated, monochromatic red light that casts deep shadows. The individual has long, wavy hair framing their face and stares directly forward with wide, dark eyes. The background is completely dark and out of focus.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the shot as a \"close-up\" focusing on the woman's face. It accurately places her in the \"foreground\" and the \"middle of the frame.\" The description of the background as \"dark and out of focus\" and the camera as \"static\" and at \"eye level\" are all correct observations.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions. It specifies the shot size, the subject's 2D position (middle), 3D depth (foreground), the camera's height (eye level), and the lack of any spatial changes (\"remains static\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It provides all necessary spatial information in a single, clear paragraph.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective words, using neutral descriptors like \"dark,\" \"out of focus,\" and \"static.\"\n    *   **No Speculation:** It describes only what is visible and certain.\n    *   **Structure:** It logically presents the information, starting with the shot size and subject, then describing the background and camera properties.",
