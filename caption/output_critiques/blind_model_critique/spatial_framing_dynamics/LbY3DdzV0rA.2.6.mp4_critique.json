    "pre_caption": "This video presents an extreme wide shot of a landscape, with no single main subject. The scene is captured from an elevated position, looking down on two parallel highways that originate at the bottom left and bottom right of the frame and recede toward a central vanishing point in the background. The top two-thirds of the frame are occupied by a vast expanse of dark, turbulent clouds in the middle ground and background. A band of intense orange light and falling rain is situated centrally along the horizon in the far background. The arid terrain fills the bottom of the frame in the foreground and middle ground, on either side of the highways. As the time-lapse progresses, the clouds swirl across the top and center of the frame, while streaks of white light move from the bottom left toward the center on the left highway, and red light streaks move from the center toward the bottom right on the right highway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, captured as a time-lapse. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with dark, purplish-gray storm clouds that loom over the scene. In stark contrast, the horizon glows with a fiery orange and red light from a setting sun, illuminating sheets of distant rain falling from the cloud base. A multi-lane highway stretches from the foreground into the vanishing point, with the movement of vehicles captured as continuous streaks of white and red light, indicating the flow of traffic through the expansive, arid terrain. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on capturing the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment, emphasizing the dramatic interplay of the storm, the sunset, and the vast, open landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse captures a dramatic scene over a vast, open landscape at dusk. Two parallel highways with white lane markings stretch toward a distant mountain range silhouetted against the horizon. The sky is filled with dark, turbulent storm clouds in shades of purple and grey. Below the clouds, a band of intense orange and red light from the sunset illuminates sheets of falling rain in the distance. The movement of traffic on the highways is visible as long streaks of white and red light, while the clouds swirl rapidly overhead.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the extreme wide shot and the general composition, it could be more precise about the visual dynamics inherent in a time-lapse. The description of the camera's \"elevated position\" is vague; specifying it as a high-angle viewpoint from a stationary overpass or a nearby hill would better clarify the perspective. The movement of the \"turbulent clouds\" could be detailed further; for instance, they might converge towards the center from the top corners or roll from the background towards the foreground, adding a sense of encroaching weather. The description of rain as \"falling\" is simplistic for a time-lapse; it would likely appear as shimmering, semi-transparent curtains shifting across the middle ground. A significant potential omission is flashes of lightning, which would be common in such a storm scene, intermittently illuminating the cloud structures from within. Finally, the description of traffic streaks could be more dynamic, noting changes in their density or brightness over time, and could also mention the presence of any static city lights on the horizon, which would serve as a fixed point of reference against all the movement.",
