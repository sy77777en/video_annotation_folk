    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium close-up of a man in the center foreground, with a golden-bronze cymbal marked \"PAISTE\" to his left in the foreground. A dark brick wall is visible in the middle ground behind him, and a cityscape forms the background. The shot transitions to a medium shot, still keeping the man in the center foreground, revealing more of the drum set with cymbals on both his left and right in the foreground. The cityscape remains in the background, and the brick wall is in the middle ground. The camera then pans slightly, following the man's movements as he shifts within the center foreground. Finally, the shot returns to a medium close-up, with the man in the center foreground, sometimes slightly to the right, and the \"PAISTE\" cymbal prominent in the left foreground, while the cityscape, including a distant tower, occupies the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with short, messy brown hair is energetically playing a drum set. He is wearing a light blue blazer over a white hoodie; the hoodie has the word \"HELLBOY\" printed in red letters within a red outlined box on the chest. He is shown shouting with an intense expression as he plays with drumsticks. Parts of the drum set are visible, including golden-bronze colored cymbals; one larger cymbal has \"PAISTE\" written on it in black lettering.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video unfolds on an urban rooftop beneath a grey, overcast sky. A sprawling cityscape, characterized by buildings of various heights and a distinct tower in the distance, forms the backdrop. A low, dark brick wall lines part of the rooftop, and metallic drum cymbals, one notably larger with \"PAISTE\" markings, are prominent elements within this setting.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a man playing the drums, with a part of the drum set visible. The shot size transitions from a medium close-up of the man to a medium shot and then returns to a medium close-up at the end.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It meticulously follows all instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and perfectly aligned with the user's goal.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption correctly identifies the shot sizes (\"medium close-up,\" \"medium shot\") and their transitions.\n*   It accurately places the man in the \"center foreground\" and correctly positions the cymbals, brick wall, and cityscape in their respective 2D (left/right) and 3D (foreground/middle ground/background) locations.\n*   The description of the camera movement (\"pans slightly\") and the subject's movement (\"shifts within the center foreground\") is precise.\n*   The statement about the camera height (\"at the subject's level\") is correctly included.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description covers the entire video chronologically, detailing the initial state, the transitions, and the final state.\n*   It successfully analyzes the scene's depth by identifying and describing elements in the foreground, middle ground, and background.\n*   It includes specific, verifiable details like the \"PAISTE\" brand on the cymbal, which adds to the richness of the spatial description without being superfluous.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus:** The caption strictly focuses on **spatial framing and dynamics**, as requested.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses the specified vocabulary for shot size, 2D/3D position, and camera height.\n*   **Tone and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional adjectives (\"golden-bronze\" is a descriptive, not emotional, term) and speculative phrases (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that logically progresses through the video's events, starting with the shot size and integrating all required descriptive elements seamlessly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium close-up of a man positioned in the center foreground, accompanied by a golden-bronze cymbal labeled \"PAISTE\" to his left. Behind him, a dark brick wall is visible in the middle ground, with a cityscape forming the background. The scene transitions to a medium shot, maintaining the man's central position while revealing more of the drum set, including cymbals on both sides in the foreground. The cityscape remains in the background, and the brick wall stays in the middle ground. The camera slightly pans to follow the man's movements as he shifts within the center foreground. The shot then returns to a medium close-up, with the man predominantly in the center foreground, occasionally slightly to the right, and the \"PAISTE\" cymbal prominently in the left foreground. The cityscape, featuring a distant tower, continues to occupy the background. Throughout the video, the camera is consistently positioned at the subject's level.",
