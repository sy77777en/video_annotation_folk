    "pre_caption": "In this static over-the-shoulder shot, a person is positioned in the right foreground, out of focus, with the back of their head and shoulder occupying the right third of the frame. The camera's focus is on a smiley face made of dark, dripping marks on a white tiled wall, which is located in the center-left background. To the far left, a patterned shower curtain is visible in the background. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This over-the-shoulder shot features a person with light skin and dark, curly hair, seen from behind and out of focus in the right foreground. Only the back of their head and their bare left shoulder are visible. The focus is on a white tiled wall in the background, which has a smiley face on it. The face is composed of numerous small, dark, circular marks, with dark liquid dripping down from the curved line of the mouth.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **An over-the-shoulder POV where the camera is positioned behind the character, showing their upper body and the scene ahead, reveals an indoor bathroom setting. The focus is on a wall of white, square tiles where a smiley face has been drawn with a dark, liquid substance. The face is composed of two dots for eyes and a wide, arcing mouth made of several dots, with the dark liquid dripping down the tiles in thin streams. To the left, a shower curtain features a light green leaf pattern on a white background. The back and curly hair of a person are visible in the foreground on the right.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video, shot from a third-person over-the-shoulder POV, features a smiley face pattern on what seems to be a bathroom wall. The person appears blurry in the foreground, occupying only 30% of the frame's width on the right side, with part of their shoulder and half of their head visible.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the over-the-shoulder shot and the foreground/background positioning of the person and the wall. However, it describes the shot as \"static,\" which contradicts the detail of \"dripping marks.\" If the marks are visibly dripping in the video, this is a crucial dynamic element that should be mentioned, clarifying that while the camera is stationary, there is movement within the frame. The description of the camera height as \"at the subject's level\" might be imprecise for an over-the-shoulder shot; it is more likely positioned slightly above the shoulder, creating a subtle high-angle perspective on the smiley face. Additionally, the caption could better integrate the background elements by stating that the smiley face is on the tiled wall, which is adjacent to the shower curtain on the left, reinforcing that they occupy the same plane. Finally, while mentioning the person is \"out of focus\" is correct, the caption could strengthen its analysis of depth by noting that this shallow depth of field actively directs the viewer's gaze from the foreground figure to the sharply focused, dripping face in the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this over-the-shoulder shot, a person is positioned in the right foreground, out of focus, with the back of their head and shoulder occupying the right third of the frame. The camera remains stationary, but the dynamic element of dark marks visibly dripping on a white tiled wall draws attention to the center-left background. The camera is slightly above the shoulder, offering a subtle high-angle perspective on the smiley face. The tiled wall with the smiley face is adjacent to a patterned shower curtain on the far left, indicating they share the same plane.
