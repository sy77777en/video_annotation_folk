    "pre_caption": "In a medium close-up shot, a woman is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. She holds a tablet in the center-left of the frame. In the background, a framed picture is visible on the wall in the top-left. The camera is positioned at her level, and the shot remains static.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young woman with blonde hair pulled back from her face is lying in bed, propped up against a pillow. She is wearing a white t-shirt and is partially covered by a blanket. In her hands, she holds a black tablet computer, looking down at its screen with a slight smile. The scene is dimly lit with a cool, blue-toned light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dimly lit bedroom at night, a person is propped up against pillows in bed, covered by a white comforter. The room is bathed in a cool, blue light that emanates from a tablet they are holding. On the wall behind the bed, a small, framed picture is faintly visible.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the initial medium close-up and the woman's position in the center-right, it misses the dynamic changes resulting from the camera movement. The description should specify that the forward camera motion transitions the shot from a medium close-up to a close-up, tightening the frame on the woman's face and shoulders. The caption also lacks depth in its spatial analysis; it places the woman in the middle ground but fails to identify the tablet she is holding as a foreground element, which is spatially closer to the camera than she is. Furthermore, as the camera pushes in, the tablet, initially on the left, would likely become partially cropped out of the frame, a key change that is not mentioned. The description of the background is also incomplete; for example, it omits a soft-focus lamp visible in the background-right, which balances the composition against the picture in the top-left. Finally, stating the woman remains in the \"center-right\" is likely inaccurate, as a forward dolly movement often includes a slight reframing to make the subject more central as the shot tightens, isolating her from the surrounding environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a medium close-up shot of a woman positioned in the center-right of the frame, holding a tablet in the center-left. As the camera moves forward, the shot transitions to a close-up, focusing on the woman's face and shoulders. This movement shifts the tablet, initially in the foreground, partially out of the frame. In the background, a framed picture is visible on the wall in the top-left, while a soft-focus lamp appears in the background-right, creating a balanced composition. As the camera pushes in, the woman becomes more centrally framed, isolating her from the surrounding environment.",
