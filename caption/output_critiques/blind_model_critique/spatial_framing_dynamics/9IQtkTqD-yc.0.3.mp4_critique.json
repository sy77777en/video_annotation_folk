    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, scenery shot from a forward-moving perspective down a narrow road, viewed through a circular frame. Initially, the road is positioned in the center, extending from the bottom foreground into the dark background. A bright pool of light illuminates the path in the bottom center foreground. Dense woods line both the left and right sides of the frame, creating a tunnel-like effect. As the viewpoint moves forward, the scenery on the right side of the frame opens up, revealing a field in the middle ground and background, while the dense woods on the left remain in their position. The camera is positioned at a low angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a scenery shot of a vehicle traveling up a narrow, wooded road at night, viewed through a night-vision lens that casts a grainy, monochromatic green glow over the landscape. A single beam of light illuminates the rough, unpaved path ahead, which is lined on both sides by dense, dark woods with bare trees. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on capturing the isolated and eerie atmosphere of the nocturnal journey through the remote, natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures a forward-moving perspective down a narrow, unpaved road at night, as seen through a night vision device. The entire scene is rendered in a grainy, monochromatic green and is contained within a circular frame with a black border. Three bright, circular pools of light illuminate the road directly ahead and both sides of the tree-lined walls, emphasizing the road's uneven surface and catching small, reflective specks floating in the air. Initially, dense trees and foliage on either side appear as pale, ghostly forms, creating a tunnel-like effect as the viewpoint advances into the darkness. As the video progresses, the right side of the tree wall opens up into an open area, adding depth and variation to the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the forward motion and the distinct circular framing, its spatial description could be more precise. The positioning of the light pools is confusing; describing a light in the \"top right foreground\" is contradictory, and it would be clearer to place the further lights in the middle ground to accurately reflect their depth on the road ahead. The description of the scenery transition is also somewhat static. Instead of stating the scenery on the right \"opens up,\" it would be more dynamic to describe the woods as receding and exiting the right side of the frame as the viewpoint advances. Similarly, the woods on the left do not \"remain in their position\" but continuously move from the middle ground toward the foreground before passing out of view. Lastly, the caption could be improved by noting if the road curves during this transition, as this would be a significant change in the central element's spatial orientation within the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases a dynamic, forward-moving perspective down a narrow road, viewed through a circular frame. The road begins in the center, stretching from the bottom foreground into the dark background, with a bright pool of light illuminating the path in the bottom center foreground. Dense woods line both sides, creating a tunnel-like effect. As the viewpoint advances, the woods on the right recede and exit the frame, revealing a field in the middle ground and background. Meanwhile, the woods on the left move from the middle ground toward the foreground before passing out of view. The camera is positioned at a low angle, and the road remains straight throughout the transition, maintaining its central orientation within the frame.",
