    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static scenery shot of a snow-covered mountain landscape, focusing on the overall environment rather than a specific subject. In the foreground and across the bottom of the frame, there are snow-covered mountain ridges. A massive, dark cube is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground and partially obscured by the foreground mountains. Additional mountain peaks are visible in the middle ground to the left and right of the cube, as well as in the background. The overcast sky fills the top portion of the frame. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking across the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a vast, desolate mountain range covered in snow under a gloomy, overcast sky. The scene is bathed in a cold, blue light, emphasizing the frigid and remote environment. A massive, dark, featureless cube, a surreal monolith, sits amidst the rugged peaks, its sheer size dwarfing the surrounding mountains. The focus is on the immense scale and the mysterious, unsettling atmosphere created by the juxtaposition of the natural landscape and the unnatural geometric form, rather than on a specific, active subject.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a vast, snow-covered mountain range under a dim, overcast sky. A massive, dark, featureless cube rests among the jagged peaks, its perfect geometric form contrasting with the natural landscape. The entire scene is cast in a cold, blue light, with the wind visibly moving through the scene. A small white overlay displaying \"[29,30]\" is present in the lower left corner.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is factually correct. It accurately identifies the shot as a wide, static scenery shot and correctly places all key elements. For example, it correctly positions the ridges in the foreground/bottom, the cube in the center/middle ground, and the sky at the top.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It successfully covers all the required analytical points:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide... scenery shot.\"\n    *   **Position (2D/3D):** It provides both the 2D position (e.g., \"center of the frame,\" \"bottom of the frame\") and 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for every major element.\n    *   **Height:** It correctly notes the \"high angle\" of the camera.\n    *   **Dynamics:** It correctly identifies the shot as \"static.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the stylistic and structural rules perfectly.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand while remaining informative.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (using descriptive words like \"dark\" and \"massive\" which relate to visual properties and scale) and speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that logically describes the scene from the overall shot type down to the specific placement of elements.\n    *   **Focus:** It remains strictly focused on the \"spatial framing and dynamics\" as requested, without adding any narrative or interpretation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This wide, static scenery shot captures a snow-covered mountain landscape, emphasizing the overall environment rather than a specific subject. Snow-covered mountain ridges fill the foreground and bottom of the frame. A massive, dark cube is centrally positioned in the middle ground, partially obscured by the foreground mountains. Additional mountain peaks are visible in the middle ground to the left and right of the cube, as well as in the background. The overcast sky occupies the top portion of the frame. The camera is set at a high angle, looking across the landscape.",
