    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective at eye-level, a rifle is held in the bottom foreground. A soldier is positioned in the center-right of the middle ground, with a large hay bale to the left. The camera moves forward, following the soldier who walks toward the background, revealing a body on the ground to their left. A chain-link fence becomes more defined in the right background. The weapon in the foreground is then swapped from the rifle to a pistol. The camera stops, with the followed soldier now positioned in the left-middle ground near a rock and trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a first-person perspective through green-tinted night vision, a pair of hands in light-colored gloves holds a rifle with a red dot sight. The view follows another soldier walking away from the camera. This soldier is dressed in full combat gear, including a helmet, a light-colored tactical vest with multiple pouches, and a large backpack. An icon briefly identifies their weapon as an AK-47. A body lies on the ground to the left of the walking soldier. Later, the hands in the foreground switch from the rifle to a pistol.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, captures a nighttime scene in a rural, wooded area, viewed through green-tinted night vision. The camera moves forward across a grassy field with large, round hay bales on the left. In the background, the dark silhouettes of pine trees stand against the night sky, and a chain-link fence with a gate is visible to the right. The scene includes a heads-up display with various on-screen elements. Text at the top left briefly reads \"Checkpoint reached.\" A vertical gauge is on the left, and ammunition information is displayed in the bottom right corner. A subtitle at the bottom center reads, \"Price: Overlook's ahead...\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and strictly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption correctly identifies all key subjects (weapon, soldier, body) and elements (hay bale, fence, rock, trees). It accurately describes the sequence of events, including the forward camera movement, the soldier's path, the revealing of the body, and the weapon swap. It covers the initial state, the dynamic changes, and the final state of the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Spatial Framing Instructions:**\n    *   **Shot Size & Camera Height:** It correctly identifies the shot as a \"first-person perspective at eye-level,\" which effectively describes both the camera's height and the nature of the shot size without needing a generic label like \"medium shot.\"\n    *   **2D and 3D Positioning:** The caption excels at describing spatial relationships. It consistently provides both the 2D position (e.g., \"bottom,\" \"center-right,\" \"left\") and the 3D depth (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\") for each key element.\n    *   **Dynamics and Changes:** It clearly explains the spatial dynamics. Phrases like \"camera moves forward,\" \"following the soldier who walks toward the background,\" \"revealing a body,\" and \"swapped from the rifle to a pistol\" precisely capture the movement and changes within the frame as instructed. The final positions are also clearly stated.\n\n*   **Adherence to Stylistic Constraints:**\n    *   **Concise and Coherent:** The description is a single, well-structured paragraph that flows logically from the beginning of the video to the end.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **Focus:** The entire description is focused on spatial framing and movement, exactly as the instructions demanded.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It translates the visual and spatial information of the video into a clear, objective, and detailed textual description.",
