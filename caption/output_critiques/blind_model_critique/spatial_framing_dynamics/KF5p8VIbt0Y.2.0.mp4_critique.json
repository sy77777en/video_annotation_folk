    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot, centering on a man on the right and a woman on the left seated at a table in the foreground of a crowded cafe. In the middle ground and background, other patrons are visible at various tables, with a \"CINZANO\" sign in the top left background. The camera, positioned at the subjects' level, dollies forward, passing between the first couple to reveal a second man and woman at a table in the middle ground. The camera continues its forward movement, passing this second couple and transitioning to a full shot of a larger group of seven people at another table in the middle ground. The dolly continues, tightening the frame into a medium shot that centers on a man from this group. The shot concludes with the man holding a glass in the center foreground as a pair of hands enters the frame from the top left to pour a beverage into it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features several people in what appears to be a crowded 1920s-era establishment. Initially, the focus is on a man and a woman sitting at a small, round table. The man has dark hair, a mustache, and wears a light-colored military uniform with a kepi-style hat. The woman across from him has dark, short, curly hair, a dark cloche hat, and a dark dress with a prominent white lace collar and a long necklace. They are holding hands. The scene then moves to a second couple at another table, where a man in a military uniform argues with a woman in a dark dress and cloche hat, who then splashes a drink at him. Finally, the view settles on a larger group at a table, centering on a man with dark hair in a military-style jacket. He is surrounded by other men and women, including a woman with dark-colored hair and a pearl necklace to his left. The scene ends with the central man holding up a coupe-style glass as a hand in white shirt cuffs pours a beverage from a bottle into it.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This sepia-toned video captures a bustling, crowded cafe from the early 20th century. The camera moves through the lively indoor setting, passing by numerous small, round wooden tables where patrons are seated. The room features architectural elements like columns and a large, decorated archway in the background, with a visible sign for \"CINZANO.\" People dressed in period attire, including military uniforms and flapper-style dresses, socialize, drink from coupe glasses, and interact intimately. The scene grows more crowded as the camera progresses, culminating in a moment where a beverage is poured from a bottle into a glass that a man is holding with one hand at a central table.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video is a continuous dolly shot that begins with a medium shot of a man and woman sitting across from each other at a dining table. The camera moves forward, passing between them to reveal a medium shot of another man and a woman in an argument, and the woman splashes a glass of wine at the man. The camera then passes through this second couple and shows a full shot of seven people at another table, with more people in the background. The camera keeps moving forward until it reaches a medium shot of a man in the center, holding a wine glass in front of him. Behind him, the bartender is pouring wine into the glass, with only the bartender's hands visible in the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly fulfills all aspects of the instruction.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the initial shot size as a medium shot, the subjects' positions, and the background elements like the \"CINZANO\" sign.\n*   The description of the camera movement as a \"dolly forward\" is precise.\n*   It accurately tracks the transitions in shot size from medium to full and back to a tighter medium shot, correctly identifying the new subjects that become the focus at each stage.\n*   The final description of the man in the center foreground and the hands entering from the top left is also spot-on.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is exceptionally thorough. It covers the initial framing, the continuous spatial dynamic of the dolly, the changes in shot size, and the relative depth of all key subjects (foreground, middle ground).\n*   It successfully describes the \"reveal\" of new subjects as the camera moves through the space.\n*   It includes the camera's height relative to the subjects (\"at the subjects' level\").\n*   It describes the spatial framing of both primary subjects (the couples, the group) and secondary elements (other patrons, the sign, the pouring hands).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Format:** The output is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives and focuses purely on spatial description (e.g., \"centering on,\" \"dollies forward,\" \"tightening the frame\").\n*   **Focus:** The caption strictly adheres to the core task of describing spatial framing and dynamics. It does not speculate or describe anything that isn't visually present.\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the continuous movement and how the subjects' framing changes is clear, concise, and easy to follow.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and perfectly formatted.",
