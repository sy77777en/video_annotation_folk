    "pre_caption": "This scenery video is captured in a static extreme wide shot from a low angle, looking up at the sky. The composition is divided horizontally, with a vast expanse of dark, roiling storm clouds occupying the top and central portions of the frame in the background. A thin, dark silhouette of a flat landscape runs along the bottom of the frame in the foreground. The primary visual activity consists of frequent lightning flashes that illuminate the base of the clouds from within, concentrated in the bottom-center of the frame just above the horizon. A single, small, stationary yellow light is visible in the far background on the bottom left, situated on the horizon line.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at night over a vast, dark plain. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the immense scale and power of the storm rather than a specific main subject. The sky is filled with deep blue and black turbulent clouds, which are continuously and dramatically illuminated from within by pulsating flashes of pink, purple, and white lightning, creating a spectacular and ominous light show against the dark horizon. A single, tiny, steady yellow light is visible in the far distance on the left, accentuating the vastness of the landscape.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse shows a thunderstorm at night over a flat, dark landscape. The sky is filled with massive, roiling storm clouds in shades of deep blue and black. Frequent flashes of intra-cloud lightning illuminate the cloud base from within, creating pulsing glows of pink, purple, and bright white light that spread across the horizon. The ground below is a dark silhouette, with a single, distant yellow light visible on the far left. The light from the storm flashes continuously as the cloud structures churn and evolve.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main elements, but it misrepresents the spatial dynamics of the stationary light and under-describes the movement within the storm. While the camera pans from right to left, the \"stationary yellow light\" is a fixed point on the horizon; therefore, it does not remain on the bottom left but instead appears to move from the right side of the frame to the left as the camera pans past it. The description of the clouds as \"roiling\" is correct, but the caption fails to mention that the clouds themselves are visibly drifting from left to right, creating a dynamic counter-motion against the camera's pan. Furthermore, while the lightning is concentrated in the bottom-center, several significant flashes also occur in the upper-right quadrant of the frame at the beginning of the pan, and the video clearly shows a mix of sheet lightning that illuminates the clouds from within and two distinct forked bolts that strike down toward the horizon line, a detail the caption omits. Finally, the description could better convey depth by noting that the lightning flashes occur at various depths within the cloud mass, with some appearing much closer and more brilliant than others.",
