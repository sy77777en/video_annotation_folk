    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a man positioned in the center foreground, with the camera at his level, though the frame is tilted, creating a Dutch angle. His right hand is extended forward towards the camera, while his left hand is on his stomach. In the left background, out-of-focus mannequin heads are visible. A checkerboard pattern is present on the wall in the background and on the floor at the bottom of the frame. Electronic equipment, including a television displaying static and an orange light tube, is situated in the right background. The man remains relatively central, gesturing animatedly within the slightly shaky frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A man with dark, curly, afro-style hair and a mustache is the central figure. He has a light brown skin tone and is wearing a red, textured, long-sleeved shirt and a silver necklace with a small, teardrop-shaped pendant. He is shown with his mouth open, as if singing or speaking animatedly. His right hand is extended forward, palm out, in a gesturing motion, while his left hand rests on his stomach. In the background, at least two mannequin heads are faintly visible, though out of focus and lacking clear detail. Both are positioned to the left of the main subject and appear to have dark hair.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set indoors, in a dimly lit room with a distinct green and orange glow. The background features a wall with a black-and-white checkerboard pattern, and a similar pattern is visible on the floor. Various pieces of electronic equipment are present, including a television displaying static. A separate orange light tube adds to the ambiance. A person wearing a textured red sweater and a silver necklace stands in the foreground. On a shelf in the left background, there are some fake human heads. The overall atmosphere is dark and somewhat retro.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the key subjects and the Dutch angle, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics. The description of the man's gesture as \"animated\" is vague; it would be more informative to describe the spatial path of his hands, for instance, if his right hand moves from the center to the top right of the frame. The term \"medium shot\" might be inaccurate if his hand extends significantly towards the camera, which could create a distorted perspective that pushes the shot closer to a medium-close-up, especially if he leans in during the action. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the spatial effect of the checkerboard pattern; for example, the lines on the floor could be converging towards a vanishing point behind the man, creating a strong sense of depth that is skewed by the tilted angle. Furthermore, stating his hand is \"extended forward\" could be improved by specifying if it enters the immediate foreground, partially obscuring his body and becoming a dominant element in the composition. Finally, the description of the shaky frame could be enhanced by noting how this movement affects the relationship between the subject and the background, such as whether the background elements appear to slide behind the more stable figure of the man.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a man in the center foreground, captured in a shot that leans towards a medium-close-up due to his right hand extending significantly towards the camera, partially obscuring his body and becoming a dominant element in the composition. The frame is tilted, creating a Dutch angle, and his left hand rests on his stomach. His right hand moves dynamically from the center to the top right of the frame. In the left background, out-of-focus mannequin heads are visible, while a checkerboard pattern on the wall and floor creates a sense of depth, with lines converging towards a vanishing point behind the man, further skewed by the tilted angle. Electronic equipment, including a television displaying static and an orange light tube, is situated in the right background. The slightly shaky frame causes the background elements to appear to slide behind the more stable figure of the man, enhancing the dynamic interaction between the subject and his surroundings.",
