    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a high-angle full shot, showing a woman in the center of the frame standing on a hoverboard on a building ledge in the middle ground. As she moves forward and drops onto a lower walkway, the camera pulls back and tilts further downward, transitioning into a top-down wide shot. In this final framing, the woman travels forward along the transparent walkway, which extends diagonally across the scene, while the camera tracks backward, keeping her centered in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A woman is shown from a high-angle, top-down perspective. She is dressed in an all-white ensemble, consisting of a sleeveless top, knee-length pants, a white beanie, and white sneakers. She stands with her knees bent, balancing on a wide, wooden hoverboard that features glowing green lights on its sides.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle, top-down perspective, a person dressed in an all-white outfit initially glides along the edge of a modern building before descending onto a transparent glass walkway. The scene is set at night, high up on a building characterized by a dark, grid-like architectural frame. The walkway consists of large glass panels, offering a view of the dark space far below. As the person glides forward, the camera moves backward, tracking their movement along the transparent path. The environment is dimly lit with a cool, bluish hue, and small green lights are visible on both sides of the hoverboard.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a full shot of the subjects. It then changes to a wide shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main action and camera movement, but it misses key environmental details that define the spatial context. It mentions the woman is in the \"middle ground\" but fails to describe the foreground elements, such as the corner of the building the camera is positioned on, or the sprawling futuristic cityscape in the background that would establish the scene's immense scale. The description of the transparent walkway could be more specific by stating the direction of its diagonal path, for instance, from the bottom left to the top right. Crucially, the caption omits what is visible *through* the transparent walkway, such as the deep chasm and the city streets far below, which is a primary contributor to the sense of depth and vertigo. Additionally, while the final shot correctly places the woman in the center, it overlooks how the diagonal walkway now compositionally divides the frame, creating a strong leading line against the void on either side.",
