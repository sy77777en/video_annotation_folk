    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up shot, where a pair of hands is centrally located in the frame and positioned in the middle ground. In the foreground, a pink box occupies the bottom left, while a gold-trimmed container sits at the bottom center. The camera then tilts upward, reframing the scene into a medium close-up shot. This reveals a man who is now the central subject, positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at the subject's level for the duration of the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with fair skin, whose hands are shown painting their fingernails with white polish. The camera then tilts up to reveal the same individual, a man with curly brown hair and a prominent mustache, wearing a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top. He also wears a gold chain necklace and looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In an indoor setting with soft lighting, a person's hands with white-painted fingernails are shown on a small pink tray as one hand applies dark polish to a nail on the other. The tray, which also holds a small, ornate silver tool, rests on a glass surface next to a pink box and a gold-trimmed glass container. The camera then tilts upward, revealing a man with a mustache wearing a fuzzy, light-blue cardigan, a white top, and a gold chain necklace, providing a complete view of the individual.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a close-up shot of the subjects. It then changes to a medium close-up shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is mostly accurate and well-written but contains one significant error regarding the camera's height.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Correct:** The caption accurately identifies the initial shot as a close-up and the final shot as a medium close-up.\n*   **Correct:** It correctly describes the 2D and 3D positions of the hands (center, middle ground), the pink box (bottom left, foreground), and the gold-trimmed container (bottom center, foreground).\n*   **Correct:** It correctly identifies the camera movement as an upward tilt that reveals the man as the new central subject in the center/middle ground.\n*   **Incorrect:** The final sentence, \"The camera is positioned at the subject's level for the duration of the clip,\" is inaccurate. Initially, the camera is positioned **above** the hands (the first subject), looking down at them. After the tilt, it becomes level with the man (the second subject). The caption fails to describe this change in relative height.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the initial and final shot sizes, the spatial positions of key elements, and the camera movement. However, it is incomplete in its description of the camera's height, as it misses the initial high-angle perspective and the subsequent change.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption adheres well to the stylistic guidelines: it is a single paragraph, uses simple and objective language, and avoids speculation.\n*   It fails to fully adhere to the instruction to describe **any changes** in height relative to the camera. By incorrectly stating the height is constant, it misses a key spatial dynamic of the shot.\n\nIn summary, the caption is very good but needs to be corrected to reflect the change in the camera's relative height from a high-angle shot on the hands to an eye-level shot on the man.",
