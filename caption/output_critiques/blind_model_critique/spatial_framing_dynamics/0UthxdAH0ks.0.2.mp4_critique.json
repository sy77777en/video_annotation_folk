    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a long, arched structure resembling a greenhouse or animal enclosure. The camera captures the entire length of the corridor, showing metal railings lining both sides. The corridor extends from the foreground to the background, with the far end visible at the center of the frame. The sides of the corridor feature transparent panels, allowing a view of the outdoors. The camera remains stationary throughout the video, maintaining a consistent perspective. The spatial position of the corridor remains unchanged, with the central pathway running directly towards the viewer. The camera is positioned at a height that aligns with the corridor's midline, providing a clear view of the entire scene. The subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame, overlaying the scene without altering the spatial composition. There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning during the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a long, arched structure resembling a greenhouse or animal enclosure, with metal railings lining both sides. A black dog is centrally positioned, barking at the camera. The setting is dimly lit, creating a muted atmosphere. The dog appears to be moving through the corridor, which is flanked by enclosures containing animals, likely pigs. The overall scene suggests a controlled environment, possibly for livestock or agricultural purposes.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an indoor setting within a large, industrial livestock farm. The environment features a long, arched ceiling, while the sides are transparent, allowing a view of the outdoors. The interior is divided into different sections by metal railings, likely for pig farming, suggesting an organized, utilitarian design. The atmosphere is dim, indicating an overcast day. The scene includes motion, with a black dog barking. Overlays include subtitles at the bottom, displaying text in both Chinese and English, such as \"Keep going!\" and \"Stop acting like pigs!\" These overlays are not part of the physical environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is generally good but has some notable inaccuracies and areas for improvement regarding the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the shot size as a wide shot, the main subject as a long, arched corridor, and notes the stationary camera and consistent framing.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description states the \"central pathway running directly towards the viewer.\" This is incorrect. The one-point perspective clearly shows the corridor receding *away from* the viewer, moving from the foreground into the background.\n*   **Slightly Speculative:** The phrase \"resembling a greenhouse or animal enclosure\" is interpretive. The instructions ask to avoid speculation. A more neutral description like \"a long, arched corridor\" or \"a tunnel-like structure\" would be more compliant.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Good:** The caption successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions: shot size, 2D position (center), 3D depth (foreground to background), camera height (midline), and dynamics (stationary). It also identifies key elements like railings and transparent panels.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption follows the paragraph format, uses simple language, and attempts to describe the spatial framing systematically. It correctly identifies the lack of movement.\n*   **Needs Improvement:**\n    *   **Redundancy:** The caption is repetitive. It states \"The camera remains stationary,\" \"The spatial position of the corridor remains unchanged,\" and \"There are no significant changes in shot size or spatial positioning.\" These three points convey the same information and could be consolidated for better conciseness.\n    *   **Focus:** While mentioning the subtitles is not wrong, the instructions emphasize describing the spatial framing of *subjects and elements within the scene*. As an overlay, the subtitles are a lower-priority detail.\n\n**Revised Example (for comparison):**\n\nIn a stationary wide shot, a long, arched corridor is framed symmetrically, extending from the foreground deep into the background where its far end is centered. Metal railings on the left and right sides line the pathway, and transparent panels along the structure's walls reveal the outdoors in the middle ground. The camera is positioned at a height level with the corridor's horizontal midline, maintaining a constant perspective throughout. Subtitles are overlaid at the bottom of the frame.",
