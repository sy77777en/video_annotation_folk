    "pre_caption": "A medium shot shows a young man standing in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. He is framed by two tree trunks, one on the far left and one on the far right of the frame. He holds a flashlight in the center, which illuminates him against a completely dark background. The camera remains static at the subject's level throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A young, fair-skinned man stands in a dark setting, illuminated by a small, lit flashlight he holds in his right hand. He is wearing a light green hoodie with the word \"VANS\" printed in dark letters across the chest and a light-colored baseball cap. His mouth is slightly agape as he looks forward, and the flashlight's beam is directed towards the viewer, casting a bright light on his face and upper torso.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark forest at night, a person wearing a green hoodie and a cap stands between two tree trunks. The scene is almost completely dark, illuminated only by a small, bright flashlight held by the individual, which casts a focused light on them while the surrounding woods remain in deep shadow.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the medium shot, the subject's central position, and the static, level camera. However, it oversimplifies the spatial dynamics created by the lighting and depth. The claim of a \"completely dark background\" might be inaccurate; the flashlight beam likely spills onto foliage or branches in the middle ground, creating subtle depth that is not mentioned. More importantly, the caption fails to describe the direction of the light from the flashlight—for instance, if it's held below his face, creating distinct underlighting that carves his form out of the darkness. This directionality is a crucial spatial element. The relative depth between the man and the framing tree trunks is also unclear; specifying if the trees are in the foreground with the man in the middle ground would provide a more precise spatial map. Finally, while the camera is static, the man himself likely exhibits subtle movements, and the hand-held flashlight might waver, causing the illuminated space to shift dynamically, a detail that is central to the scene's composition but is currently omitted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A medium shot captures a young man standing centrally in the frame, positioned in the middle ground. He is framed by two tree trunks, which are in the foreground on the far left and right of the frame. The man holds a flashlight below his face, casting an underlit glow that highlights his features and creates a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. The flashlight beam spills onto nearby foliage and branches, adding subtle depth to the scene. While the camera remains static at the subject's level, the man exhibits slight movements, and the flashlight wavers, causing the illuminated area to shift and enhance the scene's spatial dynamics against the dark background.",
