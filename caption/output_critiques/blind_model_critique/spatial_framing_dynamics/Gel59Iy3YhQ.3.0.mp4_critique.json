    "pre_caption": "From a static, first-person perspective, a hand holding a walkie-talkie is positioned in the bottom-left foreground. A dirt path originates in the bottom-center foreground and extends into the middle ground. The path is flanked by large, angular rocks, with a significant formation occupying the right side of the frame from the foreground to the middle ground. A wooden pole stands on the far left in the middle ground, from which power lines stretch across the top of the frame toward the right. Green trees and bushes are scattered throughout the middle ground, with the sky visible in the background at the top of the frame. The camera remains stationary at an eye-level height throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a hand holding a yellow walkie-talkie with a black antenna and buttons, partially visible in the bottom center-left. The hand appears to be of a person with medium skin. The background consists of a rocky landscape with scattered trees and a cloudy sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The hand remains in a similar position throughout.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, looks out onto a stylized, rocky landscape under a pale, greenish-yellow sky. A dirt path meanders forward between large, angular brown rocks and scattered green pine trees. In the lower-center-left of the view, a hand is visible holding a bright yellow walkie-talkie. Thin black wires stretch across the sky from a wooden pole on the left, which eventually goes out of frame from the left, and the terrain is dotted with small bushes and patches of dry grass.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It meticulously follows all aspects of the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is factually correct. It accurately identifies all the main subjects and elements (hand with walkie-talkie, dirt path, rocks, pole, power lines, trees, sky) and their spatial properties.\n*   **Completeness and Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Shot Size & Perspective:** While it doesn't use a specific term like \"wide shot,\" it effectively describes the composition by starting with the \"first-person perspective\" and the close foreground element, then expanding to the middle ground and background, which perfectly conveys the shot's depth and scale.\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** The caption excels here. For every element mentioned, it provides both its 2D position within the frame (e.g., \"bottom-left,\" \"right side,\" \"top\") and its 3D depth in the scene (e.g., \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" \"background\").\n    *   **Dynamics and Changes:** It correctly identifies that the camera is \"static\" and \"remains stationary,\" fulfilling the requirement to describe any changes (or lack thereof).\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly states the camera is at an \"eye-level height,\" as instructed.\n*   **Style and Tone:**\n    *   **Concise and Coherent:** The description is a single, well-structured paragraph that flows logically from the foreground to the background.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"large\" and \"angular\" are objective descriptors of the rocks' physical properties) and speculative phrases (\"might be,\" \"appears\"), sticking strictly to what is visible.\n    *   **Natural English:** The language is simple, clear, and easy to understand.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the prompt's goal of describing spatial framing and dynamics. It is detailed, precise, and written in the required neutral and objective style.",
