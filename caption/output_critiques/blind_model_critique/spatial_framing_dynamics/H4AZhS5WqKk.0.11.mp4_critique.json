    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, Tom the cat is positioned in the center-right of the frame, occupying the middle ground. He holds a red trident in his left hand, which extends from the bottom right toward the top right of the frame. An indistinct brown structure is visible in the left background, set against a far background of scattered bokeh lights. Throughout the shot, Tom gestures with his right hand in the center-left foreground and turns his head slightly from right to left while speaking. The camera remains stationary at his level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video shows the cartoon character Tom the cat portrayed with a devilish appearance. His fur is entirely red, except for a white patch on his chest and belly, his white hands, and his muzzle. He has small red horns on his head, a pointed red tail, and wears a red loincloth or trousers. In his hand, he holds a red, three-pronged trident. His facial expression is angry and argumentative, with his mouth open and teeth showing. He also wears a red high-collared cape and a red collar with a gold decoration.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set against a dark, out-of-focus background illuminated by numerous circular, white bokeh lights. An indistinct, brown structure is visible on the left side of the composition. In the foreground, a red, animated cat-like figure holds a matching red, three-pronged trident. The character gestures with its hands, and its facial expression shifts during the sequence.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the subject (Tom the cat), the shot size (medium shot), and the spatial arrangement of all key elements, including Tom's body, his trident, his gesturing hand, and the background elements.\n*   **Completeness:** It successfully covers all the required components from the instructions:\n    *   **Shot Size:** It begins correctly by stating it is a \"medium shot.\"\n    *   **2D and 3D Position:** It precisely describes the position of multiple elements (Tom: center-right, middle ground; trident: bottom right to top right; structure: left background; hand gesture: center-left foreground), creating a clear mental image of the scene's composition and depth.\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** It effectively captures the movement within the static shot, noting that Tom \"gestures with his right hand\" and \"turns his head slightly.\"\n    *   **Camera Height:** It correctly includes the camera's position \"at his level\" and notes that it is stationary.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n    *   It is concise while remaining highly informative, focusing strictly on spatial framing and dynamics.\n    *   The structure flows logically from the overall shot to the details of the subject and background.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It is a clear, precise, and comprehensive description of the video's spatial composition and movement, adhering strictly to all provided guidelines.",
