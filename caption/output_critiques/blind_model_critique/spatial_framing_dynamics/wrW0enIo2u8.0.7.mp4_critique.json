    "pre_caption": "The video presents a medium shot of a person walking through a snowy landscape. The subject occupies the center of the frame, with their full body visible from the knees up. Initially, the person is positioned near the left side of the frame, moving towards the right. As they walk, their position shifts from the left to the center-right of the frame. The subject remains in the foreground throughout the sequence, while the expansive snowy terrain forms the middle ground and background. The sun, low on the horizon, is situated in the background, casting a warm glow over the scene. The camera maintains a steady height, positioned at the subject's level, capturing the movement smoothly without any noticeable changes in angle or perspective. The subject's consistent pace and direction are clearly depicted within the stable framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person dressed in a light-colored winter jacket, dark pants, and dark-colored gloves, walking on a snowy landscape. The individual is holding a camera in one hand and is facing away from the viewer, suggesting they are observing the scenery. The person is wearing a hood, indicating cold weather conditions. The lighting suggests a sunrise or sunset, casting a warm glow over the scene. The person appears to be alone, with no other human subjects visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video captures an outdoor winter scene during sunset, featuring a snowy landscape with a person dressed in a white jacket and dark pants. The environment is characterized by expansive snow-covered terrain, with the sun casting a warm, orange glow across the sky and snow. The snow appears soft and slightly windswept, suggesting a cold, breezy atmosphere. In the distance, there are indistinct shapes, possibly rocks or structures, partially obscured by the snow and light. The overall setting conveys a sense of vastness and isolation, with the person standing amidst the natural beauty of the snowy expanse.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main action and camera tilt, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. The description of the person's movement as \"forward and towards the right\" is ambiguous; a more accurate description would be that the person walks diagonally away from the camera, moving from the center-left of the frame towards the upper-right. The statement that the person \"is positioned in the center of the frame throughout the video\" is likely inaccurate if they are moving towards the right; the caption should specify if the camera pans right to keep the subject centered. Furthermore, the description misses key spatial elements created by the low sun, such as the person's long shadow stretching out in front of them towards the bottom-left of the frame, which would visually anchor their movement. The description of the camera angle change from \"high angle to a level angle\" is correct but could be more descriptive by noting that the initial high angle emphasizes the feet interacting with the snow, while the final level angle aligns with the person's upper body. Finally, instead of a single \"medium shot\" classification, it would be more accurate to describe the shot as transitioning from a medium close-up on the subject's legs to a medium shot of their torso and head.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dynamic sequence of a person walking through a snowy landscape. Initially, the camera focuses on a medium close-up of the subject's legs, emphasizing their interaction with the snow from a high angle. As the person moves diagonally away from the camera, transitioning from the center-left towards the upper-right of the frame, the camera smoothly shifts to a level angle, capturing a medium shot of their torso and head. The subject's movement is accompanied by a long shadow stretching out in front of them towards the bottom-left of the frame, visually anchoring their path. The expansive snowy terrain forms the middle ground and background, while the low sun on the horizon casts a warm glow over the scene. The camera pans slightly to the right to maintain the subject's presence in the frame, ensuring a stable and fluid depiction of their consistent pace and direction.",
