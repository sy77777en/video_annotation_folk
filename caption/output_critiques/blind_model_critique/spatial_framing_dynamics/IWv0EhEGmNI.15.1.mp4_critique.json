    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a man in military gear lying diagonally across the lower right and center of the frame, positioned in the foreground on a pile of broken bricks, with his head near the center and his legs extending toward the bottom right. The exposed brick wall forms the background, occupying the upper left and top portions of the frame. Another man, partially visible, leans in from the left side of the frame, his upper body and outstretched right hand entering the middle ground from the left and top left, reaching toward the man on the ground. The camera, representing the viewer’s perspective, is positioned at ground level, parallel to the man lying down, and then shifts upward as the first-person character is helped up. During this movement, the gloved left hand of the first-person character comes into view from the bottom left, moving toward the center and making contact with the shoulder of the man in the camouflage vest, who is now more centrally positioned in the middle ground. Throughout the sequence, the camera remains at or slightly below the eye level of the standing characters, emphasizing the transition from a low, horizontal viewpoint to a more upright, interactive perspective. Green subtitles appear at the bottom center of the frame, overlaying the scene but not interacting with the physical space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video depicts a man with light skin, a full beard, and short dark hair, dressed in dark green military gear, including a tactical vest, gloves, and a helmet with night vision goggles. He is lying on a pile of broken bricks, holding a black rifle, and appears alert and focused. Another man, also with a light complexion, short dark hair, and a beard, is wearing a camouflage tactical vest over light-colored clothing. He leans over and extends his right hand toward the first man, suggesting a first-person perspective interaction. After being helped up, the first-person character places a gloved left hand, wearing a watch, on the shoulder of the man in the camouflage vest, indicating a moment of camaraderie or support.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is presented from a first-person POV shot, as if through the character’s eyes, set indoors within a dimly lit, partially ruined brick structure. The environment features exposed, uneven brick walls and scattered debris, with a greenish tint dominating the scene, possibly due to lighting effects. A person in military gear, including a dark helmet with mounted equipment and a tactical vest, is positioned on the ground among the rubble, holding a black firearm. Overlay elements include subtitles in green, white, and yellow at the bottom center of the view, displaying dialogue between characters: \"Kyle: Never been more clear, sir...\", \"Hadir: You'll help me attack the lab, yes?\", and \"Kyle: Not on your life. You're going down for this.\"**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core action and the first-person perspective shift, it misses several key visual details that define the scene's spatial dynamics and atmosphere. It fails to mention the dramatic shaft of light cutting diagonally from the top left, illuminating a haze of dust particles that float throughout the space and create a tangible sense of depth between the characters and the background wall. The description of the second man's entry is also slightly inaccurate; he leans into the frame from the top left, and his hand reaches across the upper-central part of the frame, not from the top right corner. A crucial omission is the use of a shallow depth of field; initially, the rubble in the immediate foreground is in sharp focus, but as the camera rises, a distinct focus pull shifts attention to the helping character, leaving both the foreground and background blurred. Furthermore, the caption describes the camera's upward tilt but neglects to mention that the movement is shaky and abrupt, conveying a sense of urgency and physical effort. Finally, the description of the second man becoming \"prominent in the foreground\" is misleading; as the POV character is pulled up, the second man settles into the middle ground, framed in a stable medium shot.",
