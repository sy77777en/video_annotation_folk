    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of a person with short, straight brown hair, viewed from behind. The subject occupies the central portion of the frame, with their upper body and head filling most of the shot. Positioned in the foreground, the person faces a closed door located directly in front of them, which is situated in the middle ground. The door spans the width of the frame, with its smooth, panelled surface occupying the central and right portions. The person raises their left hand, moving it towards the door to knock. This action occurs in the upper left quadrant of the frame, indicating a slight shift in the subject's arm position. The camera maintains a steady angle at the subject's height throughout, capturing the interaction between the person and the door without any noticeable changes in shot size or perspective. The overall spatial framing focuses on the subject's back and the door, emphasizing the knocking gesture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a person with medium-length, straight brown-red hair, seen from behind. They are wearing a white collared shirt. In one part of the video, the person raises their left hand, appearing to knock on a surface. The focus is on the back of the person, with no facial features visible.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video depicts an outdoor setting in front of a closed door, likely part of a residential building. The scene is captured during the day, with natural light illuminating the area. The door is a neutral color, possibly beige or light gray, with a smooth surface and subtle paneling. A person is present, facing the door, wearing a white shirt. The individual's hair is short and dark with reddish-brown tones. The environment is calm, with the person actively knocking on the door, adding a sense of motion to the scene. The focus remains on the interaction with the door.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully meets all the specified requirements for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption accurately identifies the **shot size** as a \"close-up shot\" and correctly elaborates that the subject's \"upper body and head\" fill the frame.\n*   It correctly describes the **spatial positions** of the key elements. The person is accurately placed in the \"foreground\" and \"central portion,\" while the door is in the \"middle ground\" and spans the \"central and right portions.\"\n*   The description of the movement—\"raises their left hand, moving it towards the door to knock\" in the \"upper left quadrant\"—is precise and factually correct based on the visual information.\n*   The statement that the camera is at the \"subject's height\" and remains \"steady\" is accurate.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption covers all the required analytical points: **shot size, 2D position, 3D position (depth), camera height, and spatial movement**.\n*   It analyzes both the primary subject (the person) and the key environmental element (the door), providing a comprehensive view of the scene's composition.\n*   It addresses the static nature of the camera and framing (\"maintains a steady angle,\" \"without any noticeable changes in shot size or perspective\"), which is an important part of describing the shot's dynamics.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, dense paragraph that conveys a large amount of spatial information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"nervously,\" \"impatiently\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"appears to be,\" \"might be\"). It uses neutral, descriptive terms like \"short, straight brown hair\" and \"smooth, panelled surface.\"\n*   **Focus on Spatial Framing:** The entire description is centered on the \"how\" and \"where\" of the subjects and elements within the frame, perfectly aligning with the core instruction to describe \"spatial framing and dynamics.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n*   **Clarity:** The use of simple, natural English makes the complex spatial analysis easy to understand.",
