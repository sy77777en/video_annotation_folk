    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a wide, high-angle shot, showing a square wooden kitchen platform in the center middle ground. Two small chef characters are positioned near the center of this platform. In the foreground, recipe cards are fixed in the top left corner, a score and tip multiplier are in the bottom left, and a timer is in the bottom right. The camera then pulls back and up into an extreme wide shot, revealing that the platform is suspended from a large, pink, burning balloon that now occupies the center of the frame. As the entire assembly falls downwards, debris appears floating in the middle ground. The balloon and platform continue to descend, eventually disappearing below the bottom of the frame into the grey clouds that fill the background, leaving only the static UI elements in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video displays a gameplay scene featuring two small, cartoonish chef characters. Both chefs wear blue uniforms and matching blue hats. They are on a square wooden kitchen platform that is suspended by ropes. The platform is attached to a large, red, pumpkin-shaped hot air balloon with small fires burning on its surface. The entire assembly is shown falling through a grey, cloudy sky before disappearing into the clouds below.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a third-person 3D game video where the entire character is visible on screen, the setting is a square wooden kitchen platform suspended high in a cloudy, grey sky. The platform, which has small fires burning at its corners, is held by thick ropes attached to a large balloon structure above. The kitchen is outfitted with counters, a sink, and various food preparation stations. The view pulls away from the platform to show it is suspended from a large, pink, deflating balloon that is on fire, surrounded by floating debris against the overcast sky, before the scene is obscured by clouds. Several overlays are present: recipe cards are in the top left corner, a score and tip multiplier are in the bottom left, and a countdown timer is in the bottom right.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with the Overcooked game, showing a wide shot of two players preparing dishes on a platform floating in a hot air balloon. Suddenly, the balloon drops below the clouds and disappears from the frame.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the initial shot as a \"wide, high-angle shot\" and the transition to an \"extreme wide shot.\" The description of the elements' positions is precise, such as the \"square wooden kitchen platform in the center middle ground,\" the UI elements in the \"foreground\" at their respective corners, and the \"grey clouds that fill the background.\" The description of the movement—the camera \"pulls back and up,\" and the assembly \"falls downwards\"—is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is exceptionally complete. It covers all key aspects requested in the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It specifies the initial \"wide\" shot and the final \"extreme wide shot.\"\n*   **Position:** It details both the 2D (center, top left, bottom right) and 3D (foreground, middle ground, background) positions of all major elements, including the platform, characters, UI, balloon, and debris.\n*   **Height:** It correctly notes the \"high-angle\" perspective.\n*   **Changes:** It clearly describes the camera movement (\"pulls back and up\"), the change in shot size, the reveal of the balloon, and the downward movement and eventual disappearance of the platform assembly.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly adheres to all instructions.\n*   It is a single, concise, and coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   It focuses exclusively on spatial framing and dynamics, avoiding emotional or subjective language (\"large, pink, burning\" are descriptive facts, not subjective opinions).\n*   It avoids speculation and ambiguity.\n*   It successfully describes the initial state, the transition, and the final state of the scene, including how elements are revealed and disappear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, detailed, and perfectly aligned with the goal of describing spatial framing and dynamics. No improvements are needed.",
