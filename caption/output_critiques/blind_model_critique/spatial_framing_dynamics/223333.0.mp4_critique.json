    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot. The video begins as a completely out-of-focus close-up, presenting abstract shapes of green on the left and white in the center and right. The focus then pulls to reveal the scene. In the final composition, dark, silhouetted leaves and branches are in the foreground, framing the top, left, and right sides of the shot, with some backlit green leaves visible in the top-left. A waterfall is positioned in the background, visible centrally through the gaps in the foreground foliage. The camera is at a level angle, looking through the leaves toward the waterfall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a nature scenery shot capturing a waterfall through the foliage of a forest. The video begins with a soft, out-of-focus view that gradually sharpens to reveal the bright, cascading water in the background, framed by the dark, silhouetted shapes of leaves and branches in the foreground. There is no single main subject because the composition emphasizes the overall atmosphere and the layered perspective of looking through the dense woods to the powerful natural feature beyond. The focus is on the environment and the feeling of discovery rather than a specific object. The interplay between the dark foreground and the bright background creates a sense of depth and makes the entire scene the subject of the shot.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene begins with a completely blurred view of green and white shapes, which gradually comes into focus. The final view looks through the foliage of trees towards a waterfall in the background. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of leaves and thin branches hang down, with some leaves catching the light to reveal a vibrant green color. Behind the foliage, white water cascades down a dark, rocky cliff face, creating a high-contrast natural scene during the daytime.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a close-up shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the focus pull and the basic foreground-background layering, but it lacks detail on the final composition and dynamics. It fails to specify the final shot size of the scene, which could be a medium or wide shot of the waterfall, leaving the scale ambiguous. The description of spatial dynamics is incomplete, as it omits the constant downward movement of the water in the background, a key dynamic element. Additionally, the description of depth could be enhanced by mentioning a middle ground, for example, if there are rocks or a pool of water visible at the base of the waterfall between the foreground leaves and the background cliff face. The camera's height is also vague; specifying that the camera is at a low angle looking slightly up through the leaves would better clarify the perspective and the majestic framing of the waterfall. Lastly, the description of the foreground framing could be more precise about its distribution, such as noting if the foliage is denser on the top and left than on the right.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a completely out-of-focus close-up, presenting abstract shapes of green on the left and white in the center and right. As the focus pulls, the scene is revealed in a wide shot, showcasing a waterfall in the background. Dark, silhouetted leaves and branches frame the top, left, and right sides of the shot, with denser foliage on the top and left, and some backlit green leaves visible in the top-left. The waterfall, positioned centrally, cascades downward, creating a dynamic flow of water. In the middle ground, rocks and a pool of water are visible at the base of the waterfall, adding depth to the composition. The camera is positioned at a low angle, looking slightly up through the leaves, enhancing the majestic framing of the waterfall.",
