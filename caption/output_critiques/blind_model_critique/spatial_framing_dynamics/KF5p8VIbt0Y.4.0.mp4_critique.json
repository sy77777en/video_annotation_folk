    "pre_caption": "The video uses a medium close-up shot, framing two women from the chest up and placing them side by side in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. The woman on the left is positioned slightly left of center, while the woman on the right is just right of center, both facing slightly toward the camera and each other. A third element, a hand, enters from the bottom left foreground and moves upward toward the center, briefly overlapping the space in front of the woman on the left. The background is dark and undefined, keeping the focus on the women and the hand. The camera remains at the subjects’ eye level throughout, with no noticeable change in height or angle. The spatial arrangement emphasizes the close proximity and interaction between the two women, while the hand’s movement introduces a dynamic element in the foreground without shifting the overall framing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two women with light skin, both wearing dark, loose-fitting garments and head coverings that drape over their hair and shoulders. The woman on the left has pronounced dark eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a somber expression, with her hand raised to her chest in one moment and her gaze directed slightly upward. The woman on the right, positioned closely beside her, has similarly styled clothing and head covering, with delicate facial features and wide eyes, and she leans gently toward the woman on the left, looking up with a concerned or attentive expression. A third subject, a hand with light skin and long fingers, appears in the foreground, from center-bottom to top, brushing the air in front of the woman on the left. The overall focus remains on the two women and the reaching hand, with their close proximity and attentive postures suggesting a shared moment of concern or attention.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video takes place indoors in a dimly lit environment with a dark, undefined background that creates a sense of enclosure. Two individuals are positioned close together in the middleground, both draped in dark, textured fabric that covers their heads and shoulders, with the material appearing matte and heavy. Their garments are simple, lacking visible patterns or embellishments, and the overall color palette is monochromatic, dominated by shades of black, gray, and white. One person is seen with a hand raised to their chest, while another hand, belonging to a third figure outside the main group, extends into the scene from the left foreground, partially visible and pale against the dark backdrop. The lighting is stark, casting deep shadows and highlighting the contours of the faces and fabric, contributing to a dramatic visual effect. There are no visible overlays, text, or additional visual elements present in the video.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium close-up shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video described. It is accurate, comprehensive, and strictly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption correctly identifies all the key spatial elements and their dynamics. It specifies the shot size (medium close-up), the subjects (two women, one hand), their 2D positions (center, left of center, bottom left), their 3D depth (middle ground, foreground, background), and the camera's height (eye level). It also accurately describes the movement of the hand, which is the primary dynamic event in the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Structure and Focus:** The caption follows the requested structure perfectly, starting with the shot size and then detailing the spatial arrangement and movement. It remains focused entirely on spatial framing and dynamics, as instructed.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It uses neutral, descriptive language (\"side by side,\" \"moves upward,\" \"dark and undefined\") and successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The description is written in simple, natural English, forming a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to understand while being rich in detail.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The caption describes only what is visibly present and avoids ambiguous or speculative phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n\n*   **Effectiveness in Describing Dynamics:** The caption excels at describing the spatial dynamics. It clearly explains how the hand enters the frame, its path of movement (\"from the bottom left foreground and moves upward toward the center\"), and its relationship to the other subjects (\"briefly overlapping the space in front of the woman on the left\"). The final sentence effectively summarizes the overall spatial composition without violating the rules, framing the scene as a stable composition with a single dynamic foreground element.",

The woman on the left is slightly left of center, while the woman on the right is just right of center, both facing slightly toward the camera and each other. A hand enters from the bottom left foreground, moving upward toward the center and briefly overlapping the space in front of the woman on the left. The background remains dark and undefined, ensuring the focus stays on the women and the hand. The camera maintains eye level with the subjects throughout, with no noticeable change in height or angle. This spatial arrangement highlights the close proximity and interaction between the two women, while the hand’s movement introduces a dynamic element in the foreground without altering the overall framing.",
