    "pre_caption": "The video starts with a medium shot of the elderly man, who is positioned in the center of the frame, occupying the middle ground. His upper body is visible, and he is seated at a dining table. The camera is at his eye level. As the scene progresses, the camera pans left, transitioning to a medium shot of the woman. She moves into the center of the frame, also in the middle ground, with her upper body visible. The camera remains at her eye level throughout. Both subjects are seated at the same table, which is in the foreground, with plates of food and glasses of iced beverages placed on it. The background includes other dining tables with white tablecloths and red-cushioned chairs, along with a ceiling featuring intricate patterns and a central hanging light fixture. The transition from the man to the woman is smooth, maintaining a consistent shot size and camera height while shifting the focus horizontally across the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video initially features an elderly man and then transitions to focus on a woman seated at a dining table in a restaurant. The man, wearing a maroon shirt with a pocket, has short gray hair and glasses. He is using chopsticks to eat from a plate of noodles and vegetables, with a glass of iced tea in front of him. The woman, wearing a yellow patterned blouse, also has glasses and short dark hair. She is holding chopsticks and appears to be engaged in conversation. The camera pans left, transitioning the focus from the man to the woman.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video is set indoors in a dimly lit restaurant with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The setting features dining tables with white tablecloths, surrounded by red-cushioned chairs. The ceiling is adorned with intricate patterns and a central hanging light fixture, casting a soft glow over the scene. Notable visual elements include plates of food, primarily noodles, placed on the table in the foreground, and glasses filled with iced beverages, adding a touch of color to the otherwise muted palette. The environment is intimate, with a focus on the dining experience. The overall ambiance is calm and reflective, with a sense of quiet conversation and shared meals.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed analysis of the caption based on the instructions provided.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good and adheres closely to the instructions. It successfully describes the spatial framing, subject positions, and camera dynamics in a clear, single-paragraph format. It uses the correct terminology and avoids subjective or speculative language. However, there is one significant spatial inaccuracy and a minor point of ambiguous phrasing that could be improved.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Strengths:** The description of the shot size (\"medium shot\"), camera height (\"eye level\"), and camera movement (\"pans left\") is accurate and well-articulated. The identification of subjects and background elements is also precise.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The caption creates a spatial contradiction. It states the man and woman are in the **middle ground**, but the table they are seated at is in the **foreground**. For subjects to be seated *at* a table, both they and the table must occupy the same depth plane. Therefore, the table should also be described as being in the middle ground. The food and glasses on the table would consequently also be in the middle ground.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Strengths:** The caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the required elements:\n    *   **Shot Size:** Clearly stated (\"medium shot\").\n    *   **Spatial Position (2D & 3D):** Provided for both subjects (center, middle ground) and background elements.\n    *   **Camera Height:** Correctly identified (\"at his/her eye level\").\n    *   **Spatial Dynamics:** The camera pan and the resulting shift in framing are described in detail, including the initial and final states.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Style and Tone:** The language is simple, natural, and objective, perfectly matching the instructions to avoid emotional or speculative words.\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that flows logically from the start of the video to the end of the described action.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the spatial framing and movement of the main subjects.\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The phrase \"**She moves into the center of the frame**\" is slightly ambiguous. It could imply that the woman herself is moving, rather than the camera's movement causing her to be centered. A more precise phrasing would be: \"The pan reframes the shot to place the woman in the center,\" which clarifies that the change is due to the camera's action.\n\n### Corrected Version for Reference:\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback, improving its accuracy and clarity:\n\nThe video starts with a medium shot of a man positioned in the center of the frame and the middle ground. As the camera pans smoothly to the left, the framing transitions to a medium shot of a woman, placing her in the center of the frame, also in the middle ground. The camera remains at eye level for both subjects. They are seated at a dining table in the middle ground, which holds plates of food and glasses. In the background, other dining tables with white tablecloths and red-cushioned chairs are visible beneath a ceiling with a central hanging light fixture.",
