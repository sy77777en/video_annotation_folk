    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of a wooden bench and a waterfall within a lush forest setting. The bench is prominently positioned in the foreground, slightly to the left of the center, with its rustic design clearly visible. Behind the bench, the waterfall cascades down a rocky surface, occupying the middle ground and extending from the top center to the bottom right of the frame. The surrounding dense foliage forms the background, enveloping the scene in greenery. The camera is at the same height as the bench, maintaining a level perspective throughout the shot. The sunlight filtering through the trees creates dynamic light and shadow patterns on the bench and ground, enhancing the natural ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features a wooden bench made of logs, positioned in front of a cascading waterfall. The bench has a rustic appearance with a natural wood texture and a simple, sturdy design. It is composed of horizontal planks for the seat and backrest, supported by thicker horizontal logs. The waterfall behind the bench flows down a rocky surface, surrounded by lush green foliage, creating a serene and natural setting. The water appears clear and lively as it descends, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil scene.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a lush, green forest during the daytime, featuring a wooden bench positioned prominently in the foreground. The bench, made of logs with a rustic appearance, is placed on a patch of ground surrounded by dense foliage. Behind the bench, a small waterfall cascades down a rocky surface, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil setting. The water flows energetically, creating a contrast with the stillness of the bench. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground and highlighting the vibrant greenery. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the natural elements harmoniously blending together.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively establishes the main subjects and their general placement, it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and composition. The description of the camera being at the \"same height as the bench\" seems unlikely, as this would create a very low angle; it is more probable that the camera is at a standard eye-level, looking slightly down at the bench. The waterfall's path is described in a slightly convoluted way; a simpler description, such as stating it occupies the center-right of the middle ground, might be clearer. Furthermore, the caption focuses on the static placement of elements and the dynamics of light but completely omits the most significant movement in the scene: the flowing water of the waterfall itself. A more complete description would mention how the water moves through the frame. Lastly, calling it a \"wide shot\" might be inaccurate if the bench's \"rustic design is clearly visible,\" suggesting a \"medium-wide shot\" might be a more fitting term to convey its prominence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a medium-wide shot of a wooden bench and a waterfall in a lush forest setting. The bench, with its rustic design, is prominently positioned in the foreground, slightly to the left of center. The waterfall flows dynamically through the center-right of the middle ground, cascading down a rocky surface. Dense foliage envelops the scene in greenery, forming the background. The camera is positioned at a standard eye-level, looking slightly down at the bench, maintaining a level perspective. Sunlight filters through the trees, creating dynamic light and shadow patterns on the bench and ground, while the movement of the waterfall adds a lively element to the natural ambiance.",
