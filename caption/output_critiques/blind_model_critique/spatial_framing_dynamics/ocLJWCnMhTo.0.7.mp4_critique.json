    "pre_caption": "The video begins with an inverted medium shot, positioning two grappling individuals in the center of the frame. A dark vertical pole is situated in the center of the scene in the middle ground, with a piece of red fabric wrapped around the central subjects. Due to the inverted framing, the checkered floor is visible at the top of the frame in the background, while framed pictures hang on the background walls below the subjects. Animated, glowing orange light streaks swirl in the foreground, encircling the central action. The camera then performs a 180-degree rotation, flipping the image upright. This movement transitions the shot into a worm's-eye view, looking up at the subjects who remain centrally framed, with the camera now positioned below them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video features two people grappling with each other, entangled with a piece of red fabric. Both individuals are seen from the thighs up, with one person, who has a light skin tone, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt that has ridden up to expose their midriff, and dark-colored pants. The other person is wearing light gray or white pants. Both are standing upright, but the camera angle shifts from an upside-down perspective, creating the illusion of a change in their position during the video. They are both holding onto the red fabric, which is wrapped between them during their struggle.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This indoor scene, presented with a grainy, vintage quality and framed by black letterbox bars, is set in a room with a black-and-white checkered floor. The ceiling is blue-green. A dark vertical pole effect appears in the center of the space, with a long piece of red fabric wrapped around two figures. In the background, light-colored walls are decorated with framed pictures. The scene features animated, glowing orange light streaks that swirl and move dynamically around the central area as video effects.**\n\nThe description below already mentions the spatial framing information about the subjects or scenery in this video. Use this caption as a reference to draft the spatial framing and dynamics description. Simply expand on it to fully capture other spatial positions and movements. Do not infer the any spatial framing information already mentioned below.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with an inverted medium shot of two people grappling with each other. As the camera flips, it finally ends with a worm's-eye view.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is initially positioned at the subject's level and then changes to below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the initial inverted framing and the central subjects, but it could be more precise about the nature of the \"pole effect\" and the dynamics of the camera transition. For instance, describing the \"pole effect\" as a semi-transparent graphical overlay would clarify if it's a post-production element or a physical object. The description of the camera movement as a \"90-degree upward crane\" is confusing in the context of an inverted shot; a clearer description might be that the camera rotates 90 degrees to correct the inversion while simultaneously moving to a low-angle position. Furthermore, the feedback should detail the visual result of this transition more thoroughly—for example, specifying that the checkered floor moves from the top to the bottom of the frame and that the ceiling becomes the new background. The final state of the shot is also described too briefly; it should confirm if the orange streaks are still present and describe the subjects' position relative to the new background elements from the worm's-eye perspective. Finally, while the subjects \"remain centrally framed,\" the caption misses an opportunity to describe if their grappling motion continues or changes during the complex camera movement.",
