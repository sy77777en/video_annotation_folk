    "pre_caption": "The shot opens on a dark, indistinct background before the top of a person's head enters from the bottom of the frame. The camera tilts up to reveal the face of an older woman, transitioning into a close-up shot where she is positioned in the center-left. As she lifts her head, she then raises her hands into the foreground, looking down at them. The woman remains in the foreground, illuminated by a warm light from the front, while the background stays dark and undefined. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals an older, pale-skinned woman in a shot that begins with a slight downward tilt, then pans slightly to the right, and finally tilts slightly upward to show her face. She has long, stringy, wet, blonde hair that falls along the sides of her cheeks and the back of her neck. She appears shirtless, with her bare shoulders visible. As her face comes into full view, she lifts her head, her eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. She then raises her open hands in front of her, looking down at them with a startled expression. Her skin is illuminated by a warm, orange-toned light.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a dark, indistinct setting, a woman with long, wet, blonde hair enters the scene from the bottom and moves to the center-left. She is illuminated by a warm, low light source from the front, casting a yellow-orange glow that highlights her features and wet hair. The camera eventually captures her in a medium close-up shot against an almost completely black background with no discernible details.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a close-up shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the main subject and her actions, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and depth. The description of the background as \"dark and indistinct\" is slightly understated; in the video, there are faint, deeply out-of-focus shapes in the background, which creates a greater sense of depth than pure blackness would. The phrase \"The shot transitions into a medium close-up\" is also a bit misleading, as the initial camera tilt *is* the transition itself, moving from an extreme close-up on the top of her head to the final medium close-up framing. Furthermore, the caption misses a key detail about depth of field when she raises her hands; her face remains the sharp focal point, while her hands, though in the foreground, are slightly soft-focused. Finally, stating the camera maintains a \"consistent eye-level angle\" is incorrect; the camera starts by looking down at the top of her head and tilts up to *achieve* an eye-level perspective, a dynamic change that is central to the shot's opening movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a dark background featuring faint, deeply out-of-focus shapes that add depth. The top of a person's head enters from the bottom of the frame, and the camera tilts up, transitioning from an extreme close-up to a medium close-up of an older woman's face, now positioned in the center-left. As she lifts her head, she raises her hands into the foreground, but her face remains the sharp focal point while her hands are slightly soft-focused. The woman is illuminated by a warm light from the front, contrasting with the dark, undefined background. The camera starts by looking down at her head and tilts up to achieve an eye-level perspective, highlighting the dynamic change in the shot's opening movement.",
