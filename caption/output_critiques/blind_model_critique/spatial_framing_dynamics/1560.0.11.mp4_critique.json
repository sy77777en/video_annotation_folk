    "pre_caption": "This video opens with a low-angle wide shot, placing a large equestrian statue in the center of the frame and the middle ground. The statue is set against a building with conical towers in the background, with green trees positioned in the middle ground to the left and right. The camera moves forward and upward toward the statue, causing the framing to transition into a full shot where the statue and its pedestal become the dominant central element, filling more of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A large, green, patinated equestrian statue stands at the center, depicting a figure on horseback. The rider, wearing what appears to be a crown or halo, holds a tall weapon in one hand. The statue is mounted on a large, light-colored stone pedestal. In the background, a light-colored stone building features several conical towers with pointed roofs. To the left and right of the central statue are green, leafy trees.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone captures a low-angle, dynamic shot of a large, green-patinated equestrian statue in Budapest. The statue, depicting a figure on horseback holding a weapon, is positioned on a substantial stone pedestal. In the background stands a historic, light-colored stone building, identified as Fisherman's Bastion, characterized by its conical towers and arched walkways. Green trees are visible on the sides, and the scene is set against a pale blue sky with soft white clouds during the day.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **salient non-human subjects**, so you should focus on describing the spatial framing and movements of them.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a wide shot of the subjects. It then changes to a full shot.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned below the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and camera movement, but it lacks precision in describing the spatial depth and misses key elements that would be visible. The initial placement of the large statue in the \"middle ground\" is likely incorrect for a wide shot where it is the central subject; it would more accurately be described as being in the foreground. The caption also omits any description of the immediate foreground the camera travels over, such as a cobblestone plaza or a paved walkway, which would be prominent given the low angle. Furthermore, the description of the background is too simplistic; the base of the building is probably in the middle ground behind the statue, while only its conical towers extend into the upper background. The upward tilt would also reveal a significant portion of the sky, which is not mentioned. Finally, while the camera movement is described, the caption could better clarify the dynamic by stating that the forward dolly and upward tilt occur simultaneously, creating a continuous, sweeping motion that gradually shifts the viewer's focus from the base of the pedestal to the top of the statue against the sky.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a low-angle wide shot, featuring a large equestrian statue prominently in the foreground. The statue is set against a building with conical towers, whose base is in the middle ground, while the towers extend into the upper background. Green trees flank the scene to the left and right. The immediate foreground includes a cobblestone plaza or paved walkway, visible due to the low angle. The camera executes a simultaneous forward dolly and upward tilt, creating a sweeping motion that transitions the framing into a full shot. This dynamic movement shifts the viewer's focus from the base of the pedestal to the top of the statue, set against a significant portion of the sky.",
