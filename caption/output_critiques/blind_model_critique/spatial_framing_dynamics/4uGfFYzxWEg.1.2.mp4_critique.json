    "pre_caption": "In a static high-angle wide shot, the scene is viewed through a dark, geometric structure in the foreground that frames and partially obscures the view. In the middle ground, a figure in a red shirt sits slightly left of the frame's center, positioned on illuminated, tiered benches. This figure is surrounded by numerous gray figures seated on the same benches, extending from the left to the right of the frame and into the background, where they are mostly enveloped in shadow. The camera remains stationary above the subjects, looking down upon the entire assembly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **From a high-angle perspective, a humanoid figure in a bright red, long-sleeved shirt sits as the central focus among a crowd of other figures. This main subject is otherwise gray and featureless, seated on a tiered bench that resembles a stepped lecture hall setting. It is surrounded by numerous other identical, gray humanoid figures, all seated in similar poses on rows of benches. The entire scene is dark and shadowed, with the figures appearing like mannequins in a dimly lit, structured space. The red shirt provides the only point of vibrant color, making the main figure stand out distinctly from the monochrome crowd.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **From a high-angle viewpoint through an opening in a perforated ceiling, the scene captures a dark, cavernous interior with tiered seating. A single, warm orange light illuminates a section of the space, creating a stark contrast with the surrounding gloom. Seated in rows are numerous gray human figures dressed in gray clothing, most of whom are enveloped in darkness. In the center of the lit section, one figure stands out, clad in a bright red garment, providing a single point of vibrant color in the otherwise muted and shadowy environment.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the high-angle shot and the main subjects, its description of the camera movement creates a contradiction. It states the camera moves forward *until it approaches* the foreground structure, which is unlikely if that structure is already framing the shot; it would be more accurate to describe the camera as dollying forward *through* or *past* the static foreground element, causing the visible scene to expand and become clearer. The term \"gray human forms\" is vague; if the video shows them to be mannequins or stylized statues, specifying this would better explain their uniform appearance and stillness, which is a key compositional element. The layout of the benches could be more precise—for example, describing them as concentric arcs receding into the background would better define the amphitheater-like shape of the space. Furthermore, the caption misses the dynamic relationship between the light and the space; it could mention how the bright light on the left casts long, diagonal shadows from the tiered steps, enhancing the sense of depth and creating leading lines. Finally, it fails to describe how the forward camera movement affects the framing of the central figure in red—does this person become larger and more prominent in the frame, or does their relative size stay the same as the surrounding architecture is revealed?",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a static high-angle wide shot, the scene is initially framed by a dark, geometric structure in the foreground.
