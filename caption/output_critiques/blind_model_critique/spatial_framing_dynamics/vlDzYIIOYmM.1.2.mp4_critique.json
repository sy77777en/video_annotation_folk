    "pre_caption": "This is a static, extreme wide shot of a mountain valley landscape. The scene is framed by two large, snow-covered mountain ranges in the middle ground, with one occupying the left side of the frame and the other occupying the right. Together, they form a V-shape that directs the view toward the center, where a body of water is situated in the middle ground, and more distant mountains are visible in the background. The top of the frame is filled by a starry sky in the background. In the bottom right foreground, a patch of snow is visible. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down into the valley.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This is a landscape scenery shot of a majestic mountain valley under a clear, star-filled night sky. Towering, snow-covered mountains flank a dark, still body of water that reflects the celestial light. The scene is dramatically lit, with cool moonlight illuminating the rugged slopes on one side of the valley, while the other side remains in deep shadow. A small, warm artificial light in the foreground provides a subtle contrast to the vast, cold wilderness. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the immense scale, serene atmosphere, and breathtaking beauty of the natural environment.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **This is a nighttime scene of a snow-covered mountain valley under a clear, dark blue sky filled with stars. Two large mountain ranges, their slopes covered in white snow, form a V-shape, framing a dark, still body of water in the center. The water reflects the starlight and the dark silhouettes of the mountains. The snow is illuminated, creating a stark contrast between bright surfaces and deep shadows. In the foreground, a patch of snow on the right is cast in a warm, yellowish light.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the key landscape elements and their initial spatial arrangement, but it fails to integrate the camera's forward movement into the description of these elements, treating the scene as static. For instance, as the camera advances, the foreground snow patch in the bottom right would quickly move past and exit the frame, a crucial dynamic that is not mentioned. Similarly, the V-shape formed by the middle-ground mountains would not remain fixed; the mountains on the left and right would appear to expand outwards, moving toward the lateral edges of the frame, while the central body of water and the distant background mountains would grow larger and more prominent. The description of the \"body of water\" is also vague; a more specific detail, such as \"a still lake reflecting the starlight,\" would be more informative if visually present. Finally, the caption misses an opportunity to characterize the movement itself—a smooth, continuous glide would create a different spatial experience than a time-lapse, where the stars in the sky might also show apparent motion or streaking, a detail that is currently omitted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an extreme wide shot of a mountain valley landscape, initially framed by two large, snow-covered mountain ranges in the middle ground, forming a V-shape that directs the view toward the center.

The mountains on the left and right appear to expand outward, moving toward the lateral edges of the frame, while the central body of water—a still lake reflecting the starlight—grows larger and more prominent. In the background, more distant mountains become increasingly visible. The top of the frame is filled by a starry sky, where the stars might show apparent motion or streaking, enhancing the dynamic experience of the scene. The camera is positioned at a high angle, looking down into the valley, capturing the evolving spatial arrangement as it advances.",
