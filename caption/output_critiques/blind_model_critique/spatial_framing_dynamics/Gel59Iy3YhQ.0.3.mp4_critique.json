    "pre_caption": "This is a wide shot where a person in a canoe is positioned in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. In the foreground, dark bushes are located at the bottom left and bottom right. The canoe floats on a body of red water that fills the lower half of the frame. The background is composed of large, white foliage masses that stretch across the center, set against a dark backdrop. A large, dark, curved shape arcs across the top of the frame, above which a pale sky is visible. The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A person with brown hair, wearing a green pointed hat and a top with medium-length sleeves, sits in a dark gray canoe. A light-colored pet lies on their back. The canoe is floating on a body of water that is an opaque, deep red color, with small white petals scattered across its surface. The landscape features bushes and trees with stark white and burgundy leaves and foliage, contrasting with the red water.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **In a stylized, animated landscape, a small, gray canoe slowly moves across a body of opaque, red water. White petals are scattered across the water's surface and fall gently from above. Dark, silhouetted bushes rest on the water in the foreground. The background features large, cloud-like masses of white foliage against a dark, purplish-red land or rock formation, with the trunks of a few bare trees visible behind them. A large, dark, curved shape arcs across the upper portion of the scene, separating the landscape from a pale, bright sky.**\n\nPlease note that the **main subjects exhibit atypical posture or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the key elements and their static layering within the scene, it completely omits the dynamic aspects expected from a video description. It describes a still image rather than a moving one by failing to mention the canoe's movement; for instance, the canoe could be slowly paddling from the center toward the right side of the frame, causing its 2D position to change while it remains in the middle ground. The description of the \"large, dark, curved shape\" is too abstract; it could be more concretely identified as an overhanging tree branch that frames the top of the shot. Similarly, \"white foliage masses\" could be specified as a dense grove of white-barked trees. The caption also neglects to mention the camera's height, which, given the perspective over the foreground bushes towards the canoe, is likely positioned at a slightly high angle. Finally, describing the water's state, such as being calm with gentle ripples caused by the canoe's movement, would add crucial detail to the scene's spatial dynamics.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot of a person in a canoe, positioned in the center of the frame and paddling slowly from the center toward the right side, maintaining its place in the middle ground. In the foreground, dark bushes are visible at the bottom left and bottom right. The canoe glides over a body of calm, red water, creating gentle ripples as it moves. The background features a dense grove of white-barked trees stretching across the center, set against a dark backdrop. A large, dark, curved tree branch frames the top of the shot, above which a pale sky is visible. The camera is positioned at a slightly high angle, providing a perspective over the foreground bushes toward the canoe.",
