    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, begins with a football player holding the ball in the left middle ground, running toward the right. A second player in a similar uniform runs in the center-right middle ground, while a referee stands in the center-left middle ground. A tall, yellow goalpost is positioned on the far left, and a dense crowd fills the background. As the camera pans from left to right to follow the action, the player with the ball moves toward the center of the frame, and the goalpost exits the shot on the left. Simultaneously, a group of players in blue and white uniforms enters from the right, tackling another player in the middle ground. The crowd remains consistently in the background throughout the pan.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a grey football field, several players wearing yellow jerseys with black numbers and black sleeves, black pants, and black helmets are actively engaged in the game. A referee in a black and white striped shirt and black pants stands observing. Several other players in blue and white uniforms are also on the field, some involved in a tackle. A large crowd, mostly in yellow attire, fills the background stands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a large American football stadium, viewed from a sideline perspective. The playing surface is a grey turf field with white yard lines, including the 20-yard line, clearly visible. On the left side of the scene, a tall, yellow goalpost stands in the end zone and goes out of view as the camera pans from left to right. The background features stadium seating filled with a dense crowd of spectators, the majority of whom are wearing yellow, creating a sea of color. A low, grey concrete wall separates the field from the stands. Several football players in uniforms are on the field, and a referee in a striped shirt stands near the sideline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes a dynamic scene by breaking it down into its core spatial components. It correctly identifies the subjects (players, referee), key elements (goalpost, crowd), and their movements. The description of the camera pan and how it affects the framing of each element (player moving to the center, goalpost exiting, new players entering) is precise and logically follows the action described.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is exceptionally thorough and meets all the requirements of the prompt:\n*   **Shot Size & Camera Height:** It correctly starts by establishing the \"wide shot\" and that it's \"filmed at the subjects' level.\"\n*   **Initial State:** It clearly describes the initial spatial arrangement, providing both the 2D position (left, center-right, center-left) and 3D position (middle ground, background) for multiple subjects and elements.\n*   **Dynamics and Changes:** It effectively captures the scene's movement by describing the camera pan, the main subject's change in frame position, and the entrance and exit of other elements.\n*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** It analyzes multiple elements simultaneously—the main player, secondary players, the referee, the goalpost, and the crowd—and tracks their spatial relationships throughout the camera movement.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"dense crowd\" is descriptive, not emotional) and speculative phrases.\n*   **Focus:** The entire description is dedicated to spatial framing and dynamics, exactly as requested. It avoids describing actions beyond their spatial implications (e.g., it mentions a tackle but focuses on where it happens—\"in the middle ground\").\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Despite the amount of detail, the paragraph is clear and easy to follow. It logically progresses from the initial setup to the dynamic changes within the shot.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what the instructions asked for. It is accurate, comprehensive, and strictly adheres to all formatting and content rules, resulting in a clear and effective description of the video's spatial composition and movement.",
