    "pre_caption": "This wide shot, filmed at the subjects' level, begins with a football player holding the ball in the left middle ground, running toward the right. A second player in a similar uniform runs in the center-right middle ground, while a referee stands in the center-left middle ground. A tall, yellow goalpost is positioned on the far left, and a dense crowd fills the background. As the camera pans from left to right to follow the action, the player with the ball moves toward the center of the frame, and the goalpost exits the shot on the left. Simultaneously, a group of players in blue and white uniforms enters from the right, tackling another player in the middle ground. The crowd remains consistently in the background throughout the pan.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **On a grey football field, several players wearing yellow jerseys with black numbers and black sleeves, black pants, and black helmets are actively engaged in the game. A referee in a black and white striped shirt and black pants stands observing. Several other players in blue and white uniforms are also on the field, some involved in a tackle. A large crowd, mostly in yellow attire, fills the background stands.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene is set in a large American football stadium, viewed from a sideline perspective. The playing surface is a grey turf field with white yard lines, including the 20-yard line, clearly visible. On the left side of the scene, a tall, yellow goalpost stands in the end zone and goes out of view as the camera pans from left to right. The background features stadium seating filled with a dense crowd of spectators, the majority of whom are wearing yellow, creating a sea of color. A low, grey concrete wall separates the field from the stands. Several football players in uniforms are on the field, and a referee in a striped shirt stands near the sideline.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the subjects.\n\nCamera Height Relative to Subjects: The camera is positioned at the subject's level.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the initial setup and the camera's panning motion, it could be more precise about the spatial relationships and the culmination of the action. The phrase \"tackling another group of players\" is ambiguous; it's more likely the players entering from the right are tackling the primary subject, the player with the ball. The description should explicitly connect these events, for example, by stating that the blue and white players converge on the ball carrier as he reaches the center of the frame. Furthermore, the caption lacks a description of the final composition; it mentions the player moves *toward* the center but doesn't describe the scene at the end of the pan, such as the pile of players from the tackle now occupying the center middle ground. The description of depth could also be more nuanced; instead of a single \"middle ground,\" the referee might be in the near-middle ground while the main play unfolds in the far-middle ground, creating more distinct spatial layers. Finally, a shot from this position often includes a foreground element, like the out-of-focus turf and white sideline at the bottom of the frame, which is a key detail for establishing the camera's position and is currently missing from the description.",
