    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a medium shot of a male-presenting humanoid figure seated in the center of the frame and in the middle ground. To his left and right are other black chairs, also in the middle ground, set against a two-toned wall in the background. The camera then trucks horizontally to the left, shifting the first figure out of the frame to the right. The shot settles on a female-presenting humanoid figure, now centered in the frame in a medium shot. She is also positioned in the middle ground, with an empty chair visible to her right. The camera remains at the subjects' level throughout the entire sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video begins focused on a male-presenting humanoid figure with a featureless, metallic silver head that has a red glow on its sides. The figure is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved button-down shirt, a dark grey tie, and dark blue trousers, and its metallic silver hands are resting on its lap as it sits in a black chair. The camera then trucks to the left to reveal a female-presenting humanoid figure sitting in a similar chair. This figure also has a featureless, metallic silver head, which has a blue glow on its sides and hair styled in a bun. She is dressed in a light grey pantsuit with a white shirt underneath, and she sits with her legs crossed and her metallic silver hands on her lap.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The scene takes place in a modern, minimalist room featuring a row of black, contemporary chairs. The chairs are set against a two-toned wall, with a solid black upper section and a lower section made of light gray, rectangular panels. Two humanoid figures with smooth, reflective metallic heads and hands are seated in the chairs. One figure wears a light blue shirt and a dark tie, while the other is dressed in a light gray suit. The focused lighting casts a red glow on the first figure's head and a blue glow on the other as the camera trucks slowly from right to left.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **main subjects switching from one to another**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with a medium shot of the first subject. Then it becomes a medium shot of the second subject.\n\nThe camera is positioned at the subject's level when the first subject is in focus, and at the subject's level when the second subject is in focus.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is precise and factually correct. It accurately identifies the shot size (\"medium shot\"), the 2D positions (\"center,\" \"left,\" \"right\"), the 3D depth (\"middle ground,\" \"background\"), the specific camera movement (\"trucks horizontally to the left\"), and the camera's height (\"at the subjects' level\").\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It describes the initial scene, the dynamic transition, and the final scene. It accounts for the main subjects, secondary elements (chairs, wall), and how their spatial relationships change due to the camera movement. It covers all the required components: shot size, position, depth, height, and movement.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus:** It strictly focuses on **spatial framing and dynamics**, as requested.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand while remaining informative. It forms a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. The use of \"male-presenting\" and \"female-presenting\" is a perfect example of objective, non-speculative description.\n    *   **Structure:** It correctly begins with the shot size and logically describes the spatial elements and their transitions.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as instructed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and perfectly aligned with all stylistic and content-related rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a medium shot of a male-presenting humanoid figure seated centrally in the frame and positioned in the middle ground. Flanking him on both sides are additional black chairs, also situated in the middle ground, against a two-toned wall in the background. The camera then moves horizontally to the left, shifting the initial figure out of the frame to the right. The shot then centers on a female-presenting humanoid figure, also in a medium shot and positioned in the middle ground, with an empty chair visible to her right. Throughout the sequence, the camera maintains its level with the subjects.",
