    "pre_caption": "This video is an extreme wide scenery shot with no single main subject, focusing instead on the environment. The static, high-angle shot is captured from the bow of a container ship, looking forward. Shipping containers occupy the bottom half of the frame, arranged symmetrically in the foreground and middle ground, leading the viewer's eye toward the center. The calm ocean fills the middle horizontal section of the frame, stretching to the horizon in the background. The sky dominates the top half of the frame in the background, where a time-lapse shows clouds streaking across the scene as the sky transitions from blue daylight to a pink and purple dusk, eventually revealing stars. A text overlay is consistently positioned in the center-right of the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how they are spatially framed within the scene, including **shot size, position, depth, height relative to the camera, and any changes**. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** of the subjects and elements within the shot, considering both their placement within the frame and their relative positions in the scene. Ensure the description covers any notable spatial movements. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **This video presents a stunning time-lapse seascape, captured from a level-angle perspective aboard a massive container ship. The view looks forward from the bow, over rows of blue, red, and white shipping containers, towards the endless, calm ocean. The primary focus is the dramatic transformation of the sky; initially, wispy clouds drift across a blue canvas, which then gives way to a spectacular sunset, painting the clouds in vibrant shades of pink and purple. As darkness falls, the colors deepen, and stars begin to emerge in the night sky. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vastness of the open sea and the dynamic, atmospheric beauty of the changing sky, making the environment itself the central focus.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A time-lapse video captures the view from the bow of a container ship sailing on the open ocean. The foreground and middle ground are filled with rows of stacked shipping containers, primarily in blue, red, and white. The vast, dark sea stretches to a flat horizon. The sky undergoes a transition from daytime to dusk; clouds streak across a blue sky which gradually fills with pink and purple hues, and a few stars become visible. A text overlay is present on the right, displaying \"JEFFREY.HK\" and \"JEFFHK\" alongside Instagram and YouTube icons.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the extreme wide shot and the time-lapse transition from day to night. However, it omits the crucial dynamic of the ship's own forward motion. The video likely shows the ship's bow at the bottom center actively cutting through the water, creating a persistent V-shaped wake that expands from the foreground into the middle ground, a primary source of movement separate from the time-lapse. The description of the containers is also slightly generic; the changing light from the sunset and the glow from the ship's own navigation lights at night would cause their colors and shadows to shift dramatically, a detail that is not mentioned. Furthermore, the description of the stars simply \"revealing\" is an understatement for a time-lapse; the video would show them rotating or streaking across the sky in trails as the Earth turns, a significant visual spectacle in the final part of the scene that is more dynamic than the caption suggests.",
