    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a city street, with the entrance to an underground passage positioned in the bottom center foreground. A large building occupies the left side of the frame, while a street with a moving bus is on the right. A woman then enters from the top left and walks toward the center, at which point the framing becomes a medium shot of her from behind. She proceeds to descend the central staircase, moving from the middle ground deeper into the foreground. Throughout her descent, the camera remains positioned above her, following her movement as the ornate metal railings of the staircase frame her on the left and right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video reveals a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, seen from behind, as she walks toward and then descends a set of stairs leading to an underground passage. She is wearing a long, tan-colored coat and carries a black purse with a chain strap over her right shoulder. As she goes down the stairs, she places her left hand on the metal railing for support.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **On a city street in Chicago during a winter dusk, a woman in a tan coat descends a staircase into an underground passage. The entrance, marked by a blue sign that reads “GRANT PARK N GARAGE, 25 N Michigan Ave, Randolph Lobby,” is framed by dark, ornate metal railings. To the left stands a large, light-colored stone building, and to the right, a city bus moves along the street, which has patches of snow. The scene is lit by streetlights under an overcast sky, with other pedestrians and traffic visible in the background.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**.\n\nShot Size Information: The video begins with no subject. It then becomes a medium shot of the subject.\n\nWhen the subject is revealed, the camera is positioned above the subject.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I've just watched.\n\nThe caption accurately captures the general sequence of events, but it could be more precise about the spatial dynamics and transitions. The shift from a \"wide shot\" to a \"medium shot\" is not instantaneous as the phrase \"at which point\" implies; it's a smooth, continuous dolly-in, where the camera moves forward, following the woman as she walks, causing the frame to tighten around her before she reaches the stairs. The description of the woman remaining in the \"foreground\" during her descent is also slightly misleading; while the camera stays close, she is actively moving away from her starting plane and deeper into the scene, transitioning from the foreground to the middle ground relative to the top of the staircase. Furthermore, the initial description of the bus as just \"moving\" is incomplete; the bus is moving from right to left across the frame, eventually exiting on the left. Finally, the caption fails to mention that as the camera focuses on the woman, the building and street in the background become soft-focused, shifting the viewer's attention entirely to her and the staircase architecture.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a wide shot of a city street, featuring an underground passage entrance in the bottom center foreground. A large building dominates the left side of the frame, while a bus moves from right to left across the street on the right, eventually exiting the frame. A woman enters from the top left and walks toward the center. The camera smoothly dollies in, following her movement and gradually transitioning to a medium shot as the frame tightens around her before she reaches the stairs. As she descends the central staircase, she moves from the foreground to the middle ground, with the camera positioned above, tracking her descent. The ornate metal railings frame her on both sides, and the background, including the building and street, becomes soft-focused, directing the viewer's attention to her and the staircase's architecture.",
