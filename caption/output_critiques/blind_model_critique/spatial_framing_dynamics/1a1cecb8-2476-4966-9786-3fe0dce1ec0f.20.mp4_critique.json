    "pre_caption": "The video presents a wide shot of an urban environment, capturing a broad view of the cityscape. Initially, the camera focuses on the left side of the frame, showing a sidewalk lined with trees in the foreground and middle ground. As the video progresses, the camera pans right, transitioning smoothly from the initial left side to the right side of the frame. This movement reveals a wide intersection in the center and right portions of the frame. Traffic lights and road signs occupy the top left and center areas, while vehicles are seen moving across the intersection in the middle ground. Pedestrian crosswalks appear prominently in the lower center and right sections of the frame. The background features buildings and trees, adding depth to the scene. The camera maintains a consistent height, positioned slightly above street level, providing a clear view of the entire intersection and surrounding area. The spatial composition shifts from a focus on the sidewalk to a broader perspective of the urban intersection, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between natural and built environments.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the description.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing an urban environment with elements like traffic lights, street signs, and crosswalks. The focus is on the overall environment rather than a specific object, highlighting the interaction of architecture, streets, and natural elements like trees. The presence of cars and pedestrians adds to the dynamic urban setting, while the sky and distant structures contribute to the sense of scale and space.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The video begins with the camera focused on a sidewalk, showcasing pedestrians and the vibrant mix of green and pink foliage from the trees lining the path. It then pans right to reveal an urban street scene during the day, featuring a wide intersection with visible traffic signals and road signs. The environment is outdoors, blending natural and urban elements. The sky is overcast, suggesting cloudy weather. Buildings of varying heights are visible in the background, contributing to the urban setting. Cars move through the intersection, and more pedestrians are present on the sidewalks, indicating a bustling city atmosphere. The crosswalks and road markings are clearly defined, enhancing the structured layout of the scene.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very closely follows the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description is highly accurate in its spatial analysis. It correctly identifies a wide shot, a camera pan, and the relative 2D and 3D positions of all key elements (sidewalk, trees, intersection, traffic lights, vehicles, crosswalks, buildings). The description of the camera's height and movement is logical and precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete and covers all the required points from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** Correctly identified as a \"wide shot.\"\n*   **Position (2D & 3D):** It successfully maps out the scene, assigning 2D positions (left, right, center, top, lower) and 3D depth (foreground, middle ground, background) to multiple elements.\n*   **Camera Height:** It clearly states the camera is \"positioned slightly above street level.\"\n*   **Spatial Dynamics:** It effectively describes the camera's rightward pan and how this movement \"reveals\" new parts of the scene, shifting the composition. It also notes the movement of vehicles within the frame.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres very well to the stylistic and structural rules.\n*   **Strengths:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids speculation (\"might be,\" \"appears\") and focuses entirely on observable spatial details. It successfully describes the initial state, the camera movement, and the final composition.\n*   **Minor Area for Improvement:** The final sentence, \"...emphasizing the dynamic interplay between natural and built environments,\" leans slightly towards thematic interpretation rather than a purely objective description of spatial dynamics. While not a major error, the instruction to avoid subjective language is best served by sticking strictly to what is seen. A more direct alternative could be: \"The pan shifts the frame's focus from the tree-lined sidewalk to the active intersection.\"\n\n**Overall Judgment:** The caption is very good. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by providing a detailed, accurate, and objective analysis of the video's spatial composition and dynamics. The minor point on the final sentence is a small refinement on an otherwise outstanding execution.",
