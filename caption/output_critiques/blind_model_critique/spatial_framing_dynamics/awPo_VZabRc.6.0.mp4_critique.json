    "pre_caption": "In a medium shot, a woman with black hair is positioned in the middle ground, slightly left of center. In the foreground, the back of a man in a red cap occupies the bottom center, and another man briefly appears to his left before exiting the frame. The main subject walks from left to right, passing behind the man in the foreground and moving toward the right side of the frame. A blonde woman stands in the middle ground to the right. The scene is set in a diner with a counter in the background and booths in the foreground and middle ground. The camera remains static and is positioned at the subjects' height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The main subject of this animated video is a young woman with light skin and black hair styled in an updo, seen walking in profile from left to right. She wears a pink short-sleeved t-shirt, dark pants, and carries a light blue backpack over her right shoulder. To her right stands a woman with long blonde hair, wearing a light purple t-shirt and a white apron. In the foreground, seen from left to right, is a woman with an afro hairstyle wearing sunglasses, a man with reddish-brown hair wearing a brown jacket and a red baseball cap, and an older man with a prominent nose, wearing a dark blue cap and a grey jacket.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **The animated scene takes place inside a diner or cafe, characterized by a muted color scheme of browns and grays. In the background, a service counter is lined with stools. Above this counter, a reddish-brown valance is marked with a repeating pattern of small black crosses, with one larger cross at the center. Booths with reddish-brown upholstered backs are positioned in the foreground and middle ground. The space is illuminated by simple, spherical white light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, with unlit hanging light bulbs above the counter. On the table, there are three items: a salt shaker, a bottle of sauce, and a napkin holder.**\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the main subject.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows a medium shot of the subjects.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subjects and their general positions, but it lacks precision regarding the spatial dynamics and camera work. The description of the main subject's movement as \"passing in front of the man\" is ambiguous; it should clarify if she moves from the middle ground into the foreground, which would also change the shot size from a medium shot to a medium close-up—a transition the caption fails to mention. The statement that the camera \"moves to track the woman's movement\" could be more specific, for example, by stating it \"pans right to follow her.\" Furthermore, the caption omits the camera's height, which appears to be at eye level with the standing woman. The interaction with the blonde woman is noted, but its impact on the framing isn't fully described; mentioning that she temporarily obscures the main subject would better illustrate the scene's depth. Finally, integrating the description of the diner setting at the beginning would provide better context for the subsequent action.",

In the foreground, the back of a man in a red cap occupies the bottom center, and another man briefly appears to his left before exiting the frame. The main subject walks from left to right, moving from the middle ground into the foreground, which transitions the shot from a medium shot to a medium close-up. The camera pans right to follow her movement. As she moves, she passes behind the man in the foreground and toward the right side of the frame. A blonde woman stands in the middle ground to the right and temporarily obscures the main subject, adding depth to the scene.",
