    "pre_caption": "The video is an extreme wide scenery shot. Initially, the frame captures a dense urban landscape from a high aerial perspective, with a prominent street running diagonally from the bottom left towards the top right, serving as a central axis. Buildings in the foreground occupy the bottom of the frame, while the middle ground is defined by the buildings lining this central street and intersecting streets, and the background consists of more buildings extending towards the top of the frame. As the shot progresses, the camera slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, causing the foreground elements at the bottom to gradually exit the frame. Consequently, the middle ground elements, including the central street and its adjacent buildings, shift towards the bottom of the frame, while new urban structures and street sections continuously enter from the top, maintaining the expansive aerial view of the cityscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **The video presents a cityscape scenery shot, offering an aerial perspective of densely packed, multi-story buildings with varied roof styles and colors, including gabled, flat, and hipped roofs in shades of grey, black, red, white, etc. The focus is on the overall urban texture and architectural patterns rather than a singular subject, emphasizing the scale and layout of the city block. Straight, intersecting roads run between the blocks, with vehicles traveling on them.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A video filmed by a drone offers an aerial perspective of a densely packed urban environment during what appears to be an overcast day. The scene is dominated by the rooftops of multi-story buildings, which are closely aligned along narrow streets. These rooftops vary in color and shape, including shades of dark grey, light grey, dark brown, reddish-brown, and dark blue, with one prominent flat white roof. Some buildings feature balconies and visible chimneys or ventilation systems. The streets below show a few parked or slowly moving vehicles, including a white van. The overall color palette is characterized by low saturation with dark tones. The drone's movement provides a slow, sweeping view across the architectural landscape.**\n\nPlease note that the video is a **scenery shot**. You do not need to describe the subjects. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nShot Size Information: The video shows an extreme wide shot of the scenery.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the extreme wide shot and the rightward truck of the camera, but it simplifies the scene's spatial complexity. It describes a 'grid-like arrangement' which implies a flat, 2D pattern, failing to convey the significant depth and texture created by the varying heights of the buildings, such as taller skyscrapers in the middle ground casting shadows over shorter structures in the foreground. The description also omits the dynamic element of traffic, as tiny vehicles can be seen moving along the streets, adding a layer of motion within the static cityscape. Additionally, it misses the crucial role of light and shadow; the long shadows cast by the buildings are a dominant visual feature that defines their form and volume, and their movement across the frame as the camera trucks is a key part of the shot's dynamics. The use of 'lanes' is also a bit vague, and their position is described too generally; specifying them as 'streets' and noting their placement, for example, in the left and right thirds of the frame, would provide a more precise spatial map.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features an extreme wide aerial shot of a dense urban landscape, capturing the city's depth and texture. The frame opens with a prominent street running diagonally from the bottom left to the top right, serving as a central axis. In the foreground, shorter buildings occupy the bottom of the frame, while the middle ground is dominated by taller skyscrapers casting long shadows over these structures, adding a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. As the camera slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, the foreground elements gradually exit the frame, and the middle ground, including the central street and its adjacent skyscrapers, shifts downward. New urban structures and street sections continuously enter from the top, maintaining the expansive aerial view. Tiny vehicles move along the streets, adding motion to the static cityscape. The streets, positioned in the left and right thirds of the frame, enhance the spatial complexity, while the movement of shadows across the frame as the camera trucks is a key dynamic element of the shot.",
