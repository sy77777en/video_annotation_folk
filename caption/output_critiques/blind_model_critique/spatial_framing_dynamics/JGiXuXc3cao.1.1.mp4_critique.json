    "pre_caption": "A static, high-angle view shows a digital map interface with a white grid over a dark, textured background. In the center-left, red text reads \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL,\" positioned next to a pulsating red circle in the center of the frame. White text boxes displaying longitude and latitude coordinates are located at the top and right of the grid, respectively. A compass icon is fixed in the bottom left corner, and a timestamp is in the bottom right. As the timestamp advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the central red circle, growing in length while all other on-screen elements remain stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Analyze the subjects and elements in this video and provide a concise yet informative description of how subjects and elements are framed within the scene, including their **shot size, position, and changes** within the frame. Your goal is to describe the **spatial framing and dynamics** within the shot. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B'. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nFirst, specify the **shot size** based on the subject's size in the frame if major subjects are present. If the shot size is unclear, describe how much of the subject is visible. If no major subject exists (e.g., a scenery shot), describe the shot size in relation to the scenery.\n\nNext, describe the **spatial position of subjects and elements in the video**, if relevant. Indicate their approximate **2D position** within the frame using terms like **left, right, bottom left, bottom right, top right, top left, bottom, top, or center**. Additionally, describe their **3D position** within the scene as **foreground, middle ground, or background**. Analyze as many elements as possible, and for each element mentioned, provide both its **2D and 3D position**.\n\nFinally, describe the **camera’s height relative to the subject**, if relevant. Indicate whether the camera is positioned at the subject's height, above them, or below them. We already have this information provided at the end. If it’s not provided, try to describe it by yourself.\n\nIf **shot size or spatial position** changes, describe how these transitions occur clearly, specifying both the **initial and final states**.\n\nIn addition, the human-written captions below already describe the subjects (if any) and the scenery in this video but do not capture their spatial composition and movements. Use these captions as a reference, but do not rely on them completely. Your goal is to fully capture the spatial framing and movements in this video. Don’t write too much about the subject's or scenery's appearance.\n\nHuman-Written Description for Subjects: **A digital interface on a black screen displays a white grid over a dark, marbled background. In the center, the words \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" are shown in glowing red text, next to a pulsating red circle that marks a location. White text boxes on the grid indicate the coordinates \"LONG: 50.14\" and \"LAT: 41.46\". In the bottom right corner, a timestamp progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME\". As time advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the initial red circle. A white, diamond-shaped compass symbol is visible in the bottom left corner.**\nHuman-Written Description for Scenery: **A digital display with a dark, subtly textured background is overlaid with a white grid and a white, scaled rectangular border surrounding the frame. Initially, the text \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" appears in red on the left side of the frame and gradually moves to the left center as the video progresses. Additional overlays include white boxes displaying \"LONG: 50.14\" at the top and \"LAT: 41.46\" on the right. A timestamp in the bottom-right corner progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME,\" while a white circular icon with a diamond shape sits in the bottom-left. At the center, a glowing red dot, marking the distress call's origin, extends upward into a vertical dotted red line as time passes on the display.**\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nShot Size Information: The video features a complex scenario with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the spatial positions and movements of the main subjects or objects in the video. Do not use shot size to describe the spatial framing.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed analysis of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the digital map interface, the white grid, the dark background, the red \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" text, the pulsating red circle, the coordinate boxes, the compass, and the timestamp. The description of the dynamic action—the dotted red line extending upwards from the center as the timestamp advances—is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete and covers nearly all the required aspects from the instructions:\n*   **Shot Size:** It implicitly defines the shot size by describing the full view of the \"digital map interface,\" which is appropriate for this type of subject.\n*   **Position (2D):** It does an excellent job of specifying the 2D positions of all major elements using terms like \"center-left,\" \"center,\" \"top,\" \"right,\" \"bottom left,\" and \"bottom right.\"\n*   **Height:** It correctly identifies the camera's height as a \"high-angle view.\"\n*   **Changes/Movement:** It clearly describes the movement of the pulsating circle, the advancing timestamp, and the growing red line, while also noting that other elements are \"stationary.\"\n\nThe only minor omission is the lack of the specific 3D positional terms \"foreground,\" \"middle ground,\" and \"background.\" While it describes the layering of elements (\"white grid over a dark, textured background\"), it does not use the exact keywords requested in the instructions to define the scene's depth.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the instructions.\n*   It provides a concise, one-paragraph description focused on spatial framing and dynamics.\n*   It uses simple, natural, and objective language, avoiding emotional or speculative words.\n*   It successfully describes the initial static state and the subsequent spatial changes (the growing line).\n*   It correctly identifies the camera as \"static\" and the view as \"high-angle.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the provided instructions almost perfectly. Its only minor weakness is the omission of the specific 3D depth keywords (\"foreground,\" etc.), but it still effectively conveys the layered nature of the on-screen graphics.",
