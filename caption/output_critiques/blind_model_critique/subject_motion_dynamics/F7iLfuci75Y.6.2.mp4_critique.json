    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens on a computer screen displaying a social media post in dark mode. The post, from a user named AndresFreundTec and dated March 29, discusses the accidental discovery of a security issue and includes a link to an openwall.com article titled \"oss-security - backdoor in upstream xz/liblzm...\". As the view pulls back, a person is revealed sitting in a dimly lit room, seen mostly in silhouette in front of two monitors, one of which is the screen from the opening. The scene is then progressively obscured by the vertical gap between glass window panes or glass door panels. Through the glass between the blurred frames on both sides of the gap, the person and the screens are faintly visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the initial shot of a computer screen, the subsequent camera movement that reveals a person's silhouette, and the final framing that obscures the scene. The description of the events is factually correct based on the visual sequence described.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It covers the entire sequence of actions from the beginning of the video to the end in a logical, chronological flow. It successfully describes how the subject is first revealed and then obscured.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most instructions but fails on one critical point.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence (\"starts with...\", \"then pulls back...\", \"continues to retreat...\").\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Focus on Camera Motion vs. Subject Motion:** The primary issue is that the caption focuses on the **camera's motion** (\"pulls back,\" \"view continues to retreat\") rather than the **subject's motion**. The instruction explicitly states, \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" In this video, the subject (the person) is static (\"sitting\"). The caption should have centered the description on the static nature of the subject and used the camera's movement to explain how our view of that subject changes. Instead, it makes the camera the main actor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates the core instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" While it accurately describes the visual events in the video, its narrative is driven by the camera's movement, not the subject's action (or lack thereof). A better caption would have established that the person is static and then described how the camera's movement reveals and obscures them.",
