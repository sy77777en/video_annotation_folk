    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a screen mounted on the ceiling, displaying a news broadcast. The camera gradually zooms out, revealing more of the office environment, including desks and overhead lighting. Two individuals come into view, standing and watching the screen. The office appears to be a professional setting, with other people working at their desks in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video takes place in an office setting, featuring a screen hanging from the ceiling displaying a news broadcast. Initially, the screen is the main focus, showing an image with text at the bottom. As the camera zooms out, two people become visible in the foreground. The person in the lower-left corner, wearing a white shirt with a black plaid pattern, has short, dark hair, while the person in the lower-right corner, wearing a blue shirt and glasses, has short hair. Both are looking at the screen. The office environment includes desks, overhead lighting, and some people visible in the instance.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is partially effective but has significant flaws in its adherence to the provided instructions. While it correctly identifies the main action and presents it chronologically, it violates several key rules.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. It correctly identifies the primary motion is from the camera, which zooms out to reveal an office environment with people watching a screen. The sequence of events is logical and easy to follow.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption captures the most salient action—the camera zoom—and identifies the main subjects. However, it is incomplete in its description of the background subjects' motion. The phrase \"working at their desks\" is too general and lacks the specific detail required by the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several critical instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid Speculative Language:** The caption uses the phrase \"The office **appears to be** a professional setting.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements, including the word \"appears.\" The description should only state what is visibly happening.\n*   **Avoid Generic Descriptions:** The caption states that people are \"working at their desks.\" The instructions specifically warn against generic descriptions like \"a person is working\" and require specifying the action (e.g., \"typing on a keyboard,\" \"writing on a document\").\n*   **Focus on Subject Motion:** While the camera's motion is described well (\"gradually zooms out\"), the description of the human subjects is static (\"standing and watching\") or overly generic (\"working\"). The primary focus should be on the specific movements of the subjects themselves, not just their state or a general activity.\n\nIn summary, the caption successfully establishes a chronological flow but fails by including speculative language and using generic action verbs, both of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. A better caption would remove the speculative phrase and describe the specific actions of the people in the background.",
