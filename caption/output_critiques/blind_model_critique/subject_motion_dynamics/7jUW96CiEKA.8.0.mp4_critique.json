    "pre_caption": "A white bird, likely an egret, is seen walking slowly along the edge of a river, with its reflection visible in the water. The bird continues to move forward, maintaining a steady pace and keeping its head slightly lowered, possibly scanning the water for potential food. The background consists of a grassy bank and some scattered vegetation, indicating a natural, possibly wetland environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large white bird, likely an egret, with a long neck and slender legs. Its plumage is smooth and bright, contrasting with its dark legs and pointed yellow beak. The bird is positioned in the water near the riverbank with its feet partially submerged in shallow water,  partially reflected in the surface. It appears to be foraging or observing its surroundings, with its neck extended forward in a focused manner. The setting includes grassy vegetation and a muddy bank, indicating a natural habitat.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is inaccurate because it includes speculation. While the visual description of a white bird walking by a river is likely correct, the statements \"likely an egret,\" \"possibly scanning the water for potential food,\" and \"indicating a natural, possibly wetland environment\" are interpretations and assumptions, not verifiable facts from the video. The instructions explicitly forbid this.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is not a complete description of the *motion* because it dedicates significant space to static, non-essential details. The mention of the reflection and the detailed description of the background (\"grassy bank and some scattered vegetation\") detract from the primary goal of describing the subject's movement. A better caption would focus more granularly on the specifics of the walk itself (e.g., gait, pace changes, head movements).\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption violates the instructions in the following ways:\n\n1.  **It includes speculative statements:** The instructions state, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The caption violates this rule multiple times with the phrases \"**likely** an egret,\" \"**possibly** scanning,\" and \"**indicating a... possibly** wetland environment.\"\n2.  **It focuses on non-motion details:** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The description of the reflection and the background scenery goes against this directive to prioritize movement.\n3.  **It is not concise:** By including speculation and unnecessary scene-setting, the caption becomes less concise and direct than it should be. The core motion could be described in a single, more focused sentence.",
