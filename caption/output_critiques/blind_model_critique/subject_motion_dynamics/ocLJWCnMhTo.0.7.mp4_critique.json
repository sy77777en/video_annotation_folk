    "pre_caption": "From an upside-down perspective, two people engage in a struggle, pulling a piece of red fabric between them. The person in the white shirt leans back, their torso twisting as they grip and pull the fabric, while the other person also pulls in the opposite direction. Their movements are tense and focused on the struggle over the fabric.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two people grappling with each other, entangled with a piece of red fabric. Both individuals are seen from the thighs up, with one person, who has a light skin tone, wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt that has ridden up to expose their midriff, and dark-colored pants. The other person is wearing light gray or white pants. Both are standing upright, but the camera angle shifts from an upside-down perspective, creating the illusion of a change in their position during the video. They are both holding onto the red fabric, which is wrapped between them during their struggle.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and the primary camera movement in chronological order, but it lacks specificity regarding the subjects' actions and the nature of the central object. While it states the two individuals are \"static,\" it fails to describe their posture or how they are holding the fabric, which is crucial information. For instance, the video might show them suspended horizontally with arms outstretched, holding the fabric's corners, a detail that \"holding\" does not capture. Furthermore, the caption completely omits any description of the red fabric's state; it could be hanging limply, stretched taut, or gently swaying, all of which are forms of motion or lack thereof that should be described. The term \"transitions\" is also ambiguous for describing the camera's movement; a more precise verb like \"rotates\" or \"pivots\" would clarify that this is a continuous camera motion within a single shot rather than a cut between two different views. A better description would focus more on the subjects' static pose and the fabric's properties while using more precise language for the camera's rotation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera rotates to reveal two people suspended horizontally, arms outstretched as they grip the corners of a piece of red fabric. The person in the white shirt leans back, their torso twisting, while the other person mirrors this tension, both focused on the fabric. The red fabric is stretched taut between them, emphasizing the intensity of their struggle.",
