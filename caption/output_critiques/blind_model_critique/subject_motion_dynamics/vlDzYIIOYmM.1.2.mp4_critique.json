  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot but uses subjective and emotional adjectives like \"dynamic,\" \"breathtaking,\" and \"towering,\" which violates the instruction to remain objective. While it mentions the camera \"moves forward,\" this description is too generic. For instance, it fails to specify the nature of the movementâ€”is it a smooth, low-altitude drone shot gliding over the water's surface, or a high-angle timelapse that also captures the motion of stars streaking across the sky? The caption states the water is \"calm,\" but it misses the opportunity to describe the subtle motion of starlight reflecting and shimmering on the water's surface as the camera advances. A more effective description would avoid subjective praise and instead provide precise details about the camera's trajectory and any observable motion within the scene, such as the movement of celestial bodies or their reflections.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a static, scenic shot of a nighttime view in a snow-covered mountain valley. The camera smoothly moves forward, gliding over a calm body of water situated between the peaks. The clear sky is filled with stars, and their reflections subtly shimmer on the water's surface as the camera advances, capturing the gentle motion of celestial bodies.",
