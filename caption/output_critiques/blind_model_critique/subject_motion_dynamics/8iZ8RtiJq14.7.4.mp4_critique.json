    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a chest-up view of a faceless, mannequin-like humanoid figure. The figure has a smooth, silver, and featureless head with a pearlescent sheen. It is dressed in a white, collared dress shirt and a matching white tie, and it is positioned facing slightly to the right, in addition to facing forward.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The mannequin-like figure remains completely still throughout the video.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is accurate, assuming the video shows a static, mannequin-like figure. It correctly identifies the subject and its state of motion.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete. It successfully conveys the most essential piece of information about the subject's motion, which is its complete lack of movement. For a video with a static subject, no further detail is necessary.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all given instructions.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It focuses exclusively on the subject's motion (or lack thereof), as instructed.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is extremely concise, clear, and uses simple, natural English.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective, or speculative language. The phrase \"mannequin-like figure\" is an excellent, objective way to describe the subject without making unconfirmed assumptions. The word \"completely\" serves as a factual descriptor of the stillness, not a subjective one.\n    *   **\"No Movement\" Rule:** It perfectly follows the specific instruction: \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\"\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent sentence, fulfilling the \"one-paragraph\" requirement without any introductory text or markdown.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a perfect example of how to apply the provided instructions to a video with a static subject. It is concise, accurate, objective, and follows every rule precisely.",
