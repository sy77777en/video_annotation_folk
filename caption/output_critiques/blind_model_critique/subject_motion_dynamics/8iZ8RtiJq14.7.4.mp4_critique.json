    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a chest-up view of a faceless, mannequin-like humanoid figure. The figure has a smooth, silver, and featureless head with a pearlescent sheen. It is dressed in a white, collared dress shirt and a matching white tie, and it is positioned facing slightly to the right, in addition to facing forward.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject's general lack of movement, it is overly simplistic and misses several key visual details that would provide a more accurate and informative description. The statement that the figure is \"completely still\" might be inaccurate if there is a very subtle, final motion, such as the figure's head slumping forward slightly just before the video ends, which would be a crucial detail to include. The caption also fails to describe the camera's own movement; for example, the video might open with the camera slowly dollying in on the figure, and this motion is a primary action in the scene that provides context for the subject's stillness. Furthermore, the description neglects to mention any shot transitions or secondary actions. If the video cuts from a frontal view to a side profile, this change in perspective should be noted. Similarly, if another object, like a robotic arm, is moving in the background during one of the shots, this contrasting motion is an essential element of the scene that the current caption completely ignores.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with the camera slowly dollying in on a mannequin-like figure, which remains mostly still throughout. However, just before the video ends, the figure's head subtly slumps forward. The scene transitions from a frontal view to a side profile, providing a new perspective. In the background, a robotic arm moves, contrasting with the figure's stillness and adding dynamic action to the scene.",
