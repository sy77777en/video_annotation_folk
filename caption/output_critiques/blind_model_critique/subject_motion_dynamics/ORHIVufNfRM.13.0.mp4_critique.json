    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video presents an underwater, alien-like environment from a first-person perspective, viewed through a diving mask, which is represented by a dark, rounded border. The scene is dominated by numerous tall structures that resemble giant green-grey trunks. These structures feature broad, flat, disc-shaped tops with a dark blue upper surface and a reddish-orange stippled underside. The trunks emit glowing greenish lights from small areas around them, and some have bright pink, ring-like spots, fuchsia-colored dots, and small, glowing green bumps. Swimming through the murky teal water among these formations are large schools of small, silvery, glowing, fish-like creatures and a few bright blue manta rays.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the general camera movement, but it could be more precise about the specific actions and their sequence. The description of the camera's motion as a \"steady drift\" is too simplistic; the viewpoint actually has a slight, rhythmic bob, suggesting a swimming motion rather than a mechanical one. The caption also misses a key interaction: the school of silvery creatures does not just \"swarm and swirl\" continuously, but initially parts to allow the viewpoint to pass through its center before the two halves of the school converge again behind the camera. Furthermore, the verb \"glide\" for the blue, ray-like creatures is vague; they move by slowly and gracefully undulating their wide, wing-like fins. Finally, the caption fails to mention that the \"mushroom-like structures\" are not static but sway gently in the current, and their caps emit a soft, rhythmic pulse of light, adding to the scene's dynamic quality.",
