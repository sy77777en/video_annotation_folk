    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A large, yellow, wooden lattice crane stands on the right, featuring a tall A-frame base and a long, rotating arm from which a large, black, trapezoidal prism counterweight hangs. Suspended from the front of the crane's arm is a light-yellow toy biplane with two sets of wings, wheels, and red and blue markings on its tail. As the crane's arm rotates, the toy plane moves along a wire and uses a hook to catch a white cloth bag with the word \"MAIL\" printed on it in black. The bag is suspended on a separate line stretched between two smaller, yellow wooden A-frame posts.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It perfectly adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (wooden crane, toy biplane, mailbag) and describes their mechanical interaction precisely. The sequence of events—crane rotating, plane moving, snagging the bag, and carrying it—is factually correct and reflects the cause-and-effect nature of the motion.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete, capturing all essential movements from the beginning to the end of the action. It doesn't miss any critical steps, such as the plane traveling along a wire, the hook's specific action of snagging the bag, or the fact that the plane continues its movement after acquiring the bag.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are described in a perfect, logical sequence: the crane's arm rotates, the plane travels, the hook snags the bag, and the plane continues.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely focused on motion, using strong, specific verbs like \"rotates,\" \"travel,\" \"snags,\" \"lifting,\" and \"carrying.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is brief yet provides a full picture of the action without any filler words.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective, or speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears to\"). The description is purely factual and observable.\n*   **Specificity:** The caption excels at being specific. Instead of \"the crane moves the plane,\" it says \"The wooden crane's arm rotates to the left, causing the suspended toy biplane to travel forward along a wire.\" The interaction is also specific: \"a hook underneath it snags a white mailbag, lifting it.\"\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The language is concrete and avoids abstract interpretations like \"the plane moves gracefully\" or \"the mechanism works efficiently.\"",
