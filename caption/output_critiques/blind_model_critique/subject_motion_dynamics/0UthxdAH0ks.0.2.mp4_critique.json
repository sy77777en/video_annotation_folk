  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in describing the static elements of the video, such as the appearance of the indoor facility and the content of the on-screen subtitles. However, it is inaccurate in its primary function, as it fails to describe the motion of the subject mentioned (\"a person is seen in the distance\").\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete. The instructions require a description of the subject's motion. The caption identifies a person but provides no information about what that person is doing, whether they are walking, standing still, or interacting with the environment. It focuses on the setting and subtitles, which are secondary details, while omitting the primary required information about movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption does the opposite; it describes the setting and on-screen text instead of the person's movement.\n*   **Specificity of Action:** The instructions state to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\" The phrase \"A person is seen\" is a generic statement of presence, not a description of action or motion.\n*   **Prioritization:** The caption incorrectly prioritizes describing the background and graphical overlays (subtitles) over the actions of the salient human subject, which violates the core purpose of the task.\n\nIn summary, the caption is not good because it completely fails its main objective: to provide a concise, motion-focused description of the subject's actions. It functions as a description of the scene and on-screen text, not as a description of movement as required by the detailed instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person is walking briskly through the dimly lit indoor facility, moving between the rows of animal pens under the high, arched ceiling. As they walk, the subtitle 'Stop acting like pigs!' appears on the screen in both Chinese and English, followed by 'Keep going!' in Chinese.",
