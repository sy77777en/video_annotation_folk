    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two people are riding a dark-colored, cruiser-style motorcycle. The driver, wearing a light blue jacket and a dark helmet, is positioned in the center of the view. A passenger, not wearing a helmet, is seated directly behind the driver. The motorcycle's single, round headlight is illuminated, casting a bright reflection on the wet surface of the road.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the subject, its direction of travel, and the setting, but it lacks the specific motion details required by the instructions. While it states the motorcycle is on a \"winding road,\" it fails to describe the most characteristic motion associated with this action: the motorcycle leaning into the turns. A more effective description would detail how the vehicle banks left and right to navigate the curves. Additionally, the caption mentions the road is \"wet\" but doesn't describe the physical interaction, such as the tires kicking up a visible spray. The description of the driver and passenger is also incomplete; it could be enhanced by noting how they move in unison with the motorcycle as it leans. Finally, the claim that the vehicle \"remains centered\" seems unlikely on a winding road and could be more accurately described as the camera tracking the motorcycle as its position shifts within the frame during the turns.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A motorcycle carrying a driver and a passenger travels forward on a wet, paved road, moving directly toward the camera. As it navigates the winding road through a hilly, rural landscape, the motorcycle leans into the turns, banking left and right. The tires kick up a visible spray from the wet surface. The driver and passenger move in unison with the motorcycle, maintaining balance as it leans. The camera tracks the motorcycle, capturing its dynamic shifts in position within the frame during the turns.",
