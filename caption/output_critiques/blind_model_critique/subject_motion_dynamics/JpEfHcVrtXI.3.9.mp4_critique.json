    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a dark environment, a small, child-like figure is illuminated by a light source it appears to hold. The figure is clad in a bright yellow raincoat with a prominent, pointed hood that completely obscures its face and head. Scattered on the floor around this figure are several black, amorphous shapes that resemble puddles of a thick, dark liquid or small, shadowy creatures.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and its direction of travel, it could be more specific about the nature of the motion and the interaction with the environment. The term \"runs\" is a bit generic; in the video, the figure's movement is more of a panicked scuttle, with its feet splashing through shallow puddles on the concrete floor. The \"light source\" is clearly an old-fashioned, swinging lantern, and its \"bobbing\" motion causes distorted reflections to dance across the wet ground, a key visual element the caption omits. Furthermore, the description of the \"amorphous shapes\" is too vague. They appear to be large, slumped piles of dark cloth or rags, and the \"twitch\" is more of a slow, unsettling undulation, like something breathing, which occurs specifically when the lantern's light sweeps over them, suggesting a direct reaction rather than a coincidental movement. Clarifying that the shapes react to the light would better describe the cause-and-effect motion in the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A small figure in a yellow raincoat, clutching an old-fashioned, swinging lantern, scuttles in a panicked manner from left to right across a dark, wet concrete floor. The figure's feet splash through shallow puddles, and the lantern's bobbing motion casts distorted reflections that dance across the ground. As the figure moves, the light sweeps over large, slumped piles of dark cloth or rags, causing them to undulate slowly, as if breathing, in direct reaction to the illumination.",
