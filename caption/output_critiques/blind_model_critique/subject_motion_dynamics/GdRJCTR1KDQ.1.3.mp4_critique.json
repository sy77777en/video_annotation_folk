    "pre_caption": "A white golf ball flies toward a stationary watermelon resting on a cardboard box. Upon impact, the watermelon explodes in slow motion. The green rind cracks and peels back in several pointed sections, forming a star-like shape. Simultaneously, a spray of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, flying upwards and outwards in a cloud of small particles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A whole, oblong watermelon with a shiny, striped green rind sits atop a brown cardboard box. A small, white golf ball flies toward it and makes contact. Upon impact, the watermelon explodes in slow motion. A spray of red pulp and juice erupts from the center, while the green rind peels back in several pointed, star-like sections, revealing the bright red interior.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong chronological account of the watermelon's destruction but could be more comprehensive in its description of motion. The narrative begins with the golf ball already in flight, omitting the likely initial action of it being struck by a golf club. More importantly, the description of the golf ball's motion ceases upon impact; the caption should clarify whether the ball rebounds off the watermelon, penetrates the rind, or is engulfed and carried away by the exploding pulp. While the description of the rind peeling back is excellent, the characterization of the pulp and juice erupting as a \"cloud\" is slightly generic; a more accurate description would likely involve the particles arcing upwards and outwards before falling due to gravity. Lastly, the caption fails to mention the reaction of the cardboard box, which would almost certainly collapse or be thrown from its position by the force of the explosion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A golfer strikes a white golf ball with a club, sending it hurtling toward a stationary watermelon resting on a cardboard box. Upon impact, the watermelon explodes in slow motion. The green rind cracks and peels back in several pointed sections, forming a star-like shape. The golf ball penetrates the rind and is briefly engulfed by the explosion before being carried away by the force. Simultaneously, a spray of red pulp and juice arcs upwards and outwards, creating a dynamic display of particles that eventually fall due to gravity. The cardboard box beneath the watermelon collapses and is thrown from its position by the force of the explosion.",
