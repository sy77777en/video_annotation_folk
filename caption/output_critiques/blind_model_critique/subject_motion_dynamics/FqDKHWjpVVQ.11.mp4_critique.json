    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective in a video game, a player holds a black assault rifle, their left hand equipped with gray and black protective gloves. From this viewpoint, the player initially sees another soldier. As the camera moves and pans mainly to the left, a dark, open-frame military vehicle comes into view, followed by a soldier in green and brown camouflage lying on the dusty ground in front of a two-story, light-colored building. The view is overlaid with a heads-up display, which includes a blue minimap in the bottom-left corner and blue-and-white indicators for ammunition and health in the bottom-right.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events from a first-person perspective. It logically details a camera pan that reveals several static elements in a scene, which is a common type of video content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers the entire motion from its start (\"peeks out from behind\") to its end (\"camera movement ceases\"). It also successfully identifies the key subjects/objects revealed during the motion (vehicle, building, soldier) and their state (the soldier is \"lying on the ground\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in perfect chronological sequence using clear transitional phrases like \"then\" and \"As the pan continues.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly identifies the primary motion as that of the camera (\"peeks out,\" \"pans to the left,\" \"moving past,\" \"ceases\") because it's a first-person video. It also correctly describes the soldier's lack of motion (\"lying on the ground\").\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The single sentence is packed with information without being wordy. It clearly communicates what happens in the video.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is straightforward and easy to understand.\n*   **Objective and Factual:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"dark, slatted\" is descriptive, not subjective) and speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n*   **Specific Actions:** Instead of a generic \"the camera moves,\" it uses the more specific \"peeks out\" and \"pans to the left.\"\n*   **Revealing Subjects:** It explicitly follows the instruction to describe how subjects are revealed, using phrases like \"revealing a... building\" and \"a soldier... comes into view.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
