    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A very large, round, orange pumpkin with deep, horizontal ribs rests on a wooden platform. Its skin has a slightly textured, matte finish. A dark green baseball cap with a circular logo, which includes a small orange pumpkin and white text, is visible on the platform next to the giant pumpkin.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is a good start but lacks the specific detail needed to accurately represent the motion in a time-lapse video of this nature. The description of the pumpkin's growth as \"gradually increases in size\" is too generic; a time-lapse would likely show a more complex process, such as the pumpkin starting as a small, green fruit on a vine, then swelling and slowly ripening to its final orange color. The caption also omits the motion of the vine itself, which would be seen actively growing, with its tendrils extending and leaves unfurling across the platform. Furthermore, the word \"shifts\" to describe the hat's movement is vague. It fails to capture the discrete, jump-like repositioning characteristic of a time-lapse, where the hat would appear to instantly change its location at various intervals rather than sliding smoothly. Finally, the caption misses the opportunity to mention the flickering light that would indicate the passage of day and night, a key element of motion in any long-duration time-lapse.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a time-lapse of a pumpkin's transformation, beginning as a small, green fruit on a vine. Over time, it swells and ripens to a vibrant orange hue. The vine itself is dynamic, with tendrils extending and leaves unfurling across the wooden platform. The hat on the pumpkin appears to jump to new positions at intervals, characteristic of time-lapse motion. Additionally, the flickering light illustrates the passage of day and night, adding to the dynamic nature of the scene.",
