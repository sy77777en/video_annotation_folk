  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as an illuminated suspension bridge at dusk and accurately states that the shot is static and there is no movement.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete. Since there is no motion to describe, it sufficiently covers the content of the video by stating that fact, as per the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some instructions well but violates a key one.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **No Movement:** It correctly follows the instruction to \"briefly mention\" that there is no movement when the subject is static.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and to the point.\n*   **Clarity:** It uses simple, clear English.\n*   **Objectivity (Partial):** It avoids speculative statements like \"it appears\" or \"there might be.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The primary violation is the use of \"scenic\" and \"tranquil.\" The instructions explicitly state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" These words describe a feeling or an opinion about the scene rather than an objective fact of motion (or lack thereof).\n*   **Introductory Phrasing:** The phrase \"This is a scenic, static shot of...\" is slightly introductory. A more direct description is preferred.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version that fully adheres to all instructions:\n\nThe video presents a static shot of an illuminated suspension bridge at dusk. The camera does not move, and there is no discernible movement within the scene.",
