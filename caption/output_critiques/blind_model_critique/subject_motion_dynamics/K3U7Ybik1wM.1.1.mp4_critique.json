    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A vintage-style armchair, upholstered in red patterned fabric with a high back and carved wooden legs, is positioned on a carpeted landing behind a wooden railing. Throughout the video, a psychedelic visual effect is applied to the chair, causing its pattern to warp and swirl as multicolored concentric circles ripple across its surface.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the subject and its state. It correctly identifies that the armchair itself is \"stationary\" while the motion is a \"visual effect\" applied to it. It precisely describes the two components of this effect: the \"warp and swirl\" of the fabric and the \"rippling\" of \"multicolored concentric circles.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It establishes the static context (the stationary chair) and then fully describes the dynamic elements (the visual effects) that occur \"continuously\" and \"throughout the video,\" leaving no significant motion undescribed.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption perfectly follows the instructions by first noting the subject is stationary and then focusing entirely on describing the visible motion of the visual effects.\n    *   **Specificity:** It uses strong, specific action verbs like \"warp,\" \"swirl,\" and \"ripple\" instead of generic terms like \"changes\" or \"moves.\"\n    *   **Chronological Order:** It correctly identifies the actions as continuous and concurrent, so a step-by-step chronological description is not needed. It presents the two simultaneous effects logically.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is written in simple, natural English. It is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional adjectives (e.g., \"hypnotic\"), speculative language (e.g., \"it looks like\"), and abstract descriptions (e.g., \"creating a surreal atmosphere\").",
