    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A female-presenting cyborg with a completely shaved head is shown from the chest up. The area from her neck down to her chest is covered with a textured, mesh-like material. Her abdomen, arms, and neck are transparent, clearly revealing the reflective, chrome-like metallic structure beneath, which includes intricate components, joints, and some glowing blue elements inside. As the camera tilts upward, she remains standing, slowly lifts her head, and then slightly lowers it, revealing a calm facial expression.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is:\nThe caption correctly identifies the camera's upward tilt and the chronological sequence of the cyborg's head movement. However, it lacks specificity regarding the quality of the motion. For instance, \"gradually lifts her head and then lowers it\" is too generic for a cyborg; the video shows the movement is distinctly mechanical, with the head tilting back on a visible piston at the neck before snapping back down to its original position. The caption also misses a key detail: as the cyborg's head moves, the plates on her jawline retract and then slide back into place with a faint blue light tracing their seams. Furthermore, while the gaze is \"forward,\" the video clearly shows her pupils dilating and contracting, as if scanning, which is a significant motion that the current description omits entirely. A more accurate description would incorporate these mechanical and optical details to better convey the non-human nature of the subject's actions.",
