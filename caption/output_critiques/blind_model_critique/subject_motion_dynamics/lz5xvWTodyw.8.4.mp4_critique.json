    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A video game's pixelated desktop interface is shown, featuring a surreal, dark background with a large building and floating watermelons. An installation window for \"HYPNOS INSTALLER\" shows a blue progress bar completing the installation of \"Professor Helper.\" After the installation is complete, a pixelated character, an elderly man with glasses, a bald head with white side hair, and a brown suit with a red bowtie, appears on the right side of the screen. A dialogue box pops up next to him, asking if the user needs help. In the bottom left corner, a popsicle stick holds up a paper cutout of a simple, hand-drawn cartoon character. Subsequently, a new window appears, displaying the cover of a book titled \"BLOOD MONEY FROM THE TOP DOWN,\" which features a piggy bank overflowing with black liquid and cash.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological sequence of events but could be more precise in its description of motion and the relationship between actions. The description of the progress bar as simply \"completing\" misses the visual detail that it fills in stuttering, pixelated chunks. The caption states the \"Professor Helper\" icon is \"added,\" but in the video, it actually drops down from the top of the screen and bounces slightly as it settles into place. The appearance of the elderly man is described as him \"appearing,\" which is too generic; he glitches into view with a brief static effect. Furthermore, the popsicle stick character is mentioned out of sequence as if it appears late in the video, but it is a static element visible in the bottom-left corner from the start. Finally, the caption fails to connect the user's action to the final event; the \"BLOOD MONEY\" window doesn't just \"subsequently appear,\" it is triggered directly by the cursor's selection of the \"Yes, help me!\" option, expanding rapidly from the center of the dialogue box.",
