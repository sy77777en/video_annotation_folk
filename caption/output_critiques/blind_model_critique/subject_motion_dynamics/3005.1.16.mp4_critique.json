    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young man with short dark hair and a light skin tone. He is wearing a dark blue shirt and is captured in a close-up view, focusing on his face. His expression is neutral, with his eyes closed initially and then open, suggesting a moment of contemplation or thoughtfulness. The lighting is soft, highlighting his facial features and creating a calm atmosphere.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why it fails to meet the requirements:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the chronological description of the man's head movements (\"lowers his head slightly and then raises it... then lowers his head again\") is accurate.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption adequately describes the simple motion present in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several key instructions:\n\n1.  **Inclusion of Subjective/Emotional Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this by describing the man's expression as \"**calm and contemplative**.\" This is an interpretation of his emotional state, not a factual description of motion.\n\n2.  **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instruction forbids speculative statements like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\" The caption violates this rule with the phrase \"**it appears to be an indoor setting**.\"\n\n3.  **Focus on Non-Motion Details:** The instructions require the caption to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n    *   Mentioning the man is \"**wearing a dark blue shirt**\" is a static detail about his appearance, not his motion. It should only be included if needed to differentiate him from other subjects.\n    *   The entire final sentence, \"**The background is blurred, but it appears to be an indoor setting with soft lighting**,\" focuses on the background and setting, not the subject's movement. This is unnecessary information that detracts from the primary focus on motion.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly orders the actions, it fails by including subjective emotional analysis, speculative language, and unnecessary static details about the subject's appearance and the background. A good caption would have focused exclusively on the man's physical movements.",
