    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a man in a maroon shirt holding chopsticks and eating noodles from a plate, with a glass of iced tea in front of him. The camera then starts to pan left, gradually revealing a woman in a yellow patterned blouse sitting next to him, also holding chopsticks and looking forward. The background shows a dimly lit restaurant with ornate decor and other tables and chairs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video initially features an elderly man and then transitions to focus on a woman seated at a dining table in a restaurant. The man, wearing a maroon shirt with a pocket, has short gray hair and glasses. He is using chopsticks to eat from a plate of noodles and vegetables, with a glass of iced tea in front of him. The woman, wearing a yellow patterned blouse, also has glasses and short dark hair. She is holding chopsticks and appears to be engaged in conversation. The camera pans left, transitioning the focus from the man to the woman.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it can be improved to better align with the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects, their key features for differentiation (maroon shirt, yellow blouse), their interactions with objects (holding chopsticks, eating noodles), and the camera movement (pan left).\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is mostly complete. It successfully captures the initial action of the man and the subsequent reveal of the woman.\n*   However, the final sentence describing the static background (\"The background shows a dimly lit restaurant...\") is not essential, as the instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion\" when salient subjects are present.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence: the man eating, followed by the camera panning to reveal the woman.\n*   **Camera Motion:** It correctly and clearly describes the camera's motion (\"The camera then starts to pan left, gradually revealing...\"), which is a key requirement.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Differentiation:** It uses appearance details (\"maroon shirt,\" \"yellow patterned blouse\") appropriately to distinguish between the two subjects.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption includes several static descriptions (\"with a glass of iced tea in front of him,\" \"woman... sitting,\" \"background shows a dimly lit restaurant\"). The instructions emphasize describing motion. The description of the woman as \"sitting... and looking forward\" is passive. While accurate, it doesn't describe an action. The final sentence about the background describes no motion at all.\n*   **Refined Version (Example):** To better adhere to the instructions, the caption could be revised to focus purely on movement: \"A man in a maroon shirt lifts noodles from a plate with chopsticks and eats them. The camera then pans left, revealing a woman in a yellow patterned blouse sitting next to him and holding chopsticks as she looks forward.\" This version removes the static details about the drink and the background, keeping the focus strictly on the subjects and the camera's motion.",
