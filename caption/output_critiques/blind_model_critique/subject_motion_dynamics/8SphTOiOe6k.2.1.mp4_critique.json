    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a busy street where people walk along the sidewalk and cross the street. The camera then pans smoothly to focus on a large wooden-framed sign displaying a vibrant landscape image, which becomes the central point of interest. There is no further movement from the subjects in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens with a wide shot of a bustling street scene. As the camera pans, it shifts focus to a large, eye-catching sign framed in wood. This sign, featuring a vibrant image of a lush landscape with a clear sky, mountains, and greenery, becomes the central point of interest, drawing the viewer's attention with its serene and colorful composition.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly establishes a chronological sequence of events—starting with the people and then panning to the sign—it lacks specificity in its description of motion and makes a potentially inaccurate concluding statement. The initial description, \"people walk along the sidewalk and cross the street,\" is too generic for a \"busy street\" scene; it could be improved by detailing the flow of movement, such as \"pedestrians move in opposite directions along the crowded sidewalk\" or \"a group of people waits at a crosswalk before crossing together.\" The most significant issue is the final sentence: \"There is no further movement from the subjects in the video.\" This is ambiguous and likely incorrect. It's unclear if \"the subjects\" refers to the people or the sign. If the camera is tightly focused on the static sign, the people from the initial shot may still be moving in the blurred background, or reflections of passing cars could be moving across the sign's surface. A more accurate description would be to state that the camera's focus settles on the stationary sign, while noting if any background motion remains visible, such as, \"The camera holds its focus on the stationary sign as the blurred forms of pedestrians continue to move in the background.\"",
