    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video centers on three low-polygon humanoid figures on a large red cube. A figure on the right, dressed in a dark blue shirt and light-colored pants, sits leaning forward with its elbows on its knees. To its left, another figure in a reddish-brown outfit sits with one elbow raised. Seated behind these two is a translucent, greenish figure. A vast crowd of similar low-polygon, grey-colored humanoid figures stands around the cube, oriented in various directions. The crowd is starkly lit, with the figures on the left illuminated by a bright white light and those on the right bathed in a red glow.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the primary camera motion and the static nature of the subjects, but it could be more precise about the visual composition and the effect of the zoom. The term \"surrounds\" is general; the video actually shows the low-polygon figures arranged in a dense, orderly grid that extends to all edges of the frame, creating a sense of infinite repetition rather than just a circle. Furthermore, as the camera zooms out, it also tilts upward slightly to keep the central cube in the lower third of the frame, a detail that emphasizes the scale of the crowd filling the space above it. The description of the three figures as \"seated\" is correct, but misses that they are identical to the crowd figures, distinguished only by their elevated position and the red color of the cube they sit on, which contrasts with the uniform grey of all the figures. A more complete description would incorporate the grid-like formation of the crowd and the combined zoom-and-tilt of the camera.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera slowly zooms out and tilts upward, revealing a vast, dense grid of low-polygon figures that extends to all edges of the frame, creating a sense of infinite repetition. At the center, a red cube sits in the lower third of the frame, with three identical figures seated on it, distinguished only by their elevated position and the contrasting red color of the cube against the uniform grey of the figures. The entire scene remains completely motionless, emphasizing the scale and static nature of the composition.",
