    "pre_caption": "The camera pans slowly from left to right and then back to the left, capturing a time-lapse of a large-leafed plant growing in the center of a greenhouse. The plant's leaves visibly expand and unfurl as new shoots emerge from its base. A wooden stake is placed in the soil for support, followed by the addition and subsequent removal of a second stake. In the background, potted flowers are replaced by a different set of plants, and shadows from outside shift across the translucent walls.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Inside a greenhouse with a curved metal frame and translucent plastic sheeting, a single, large-leafed green plant, possibly a squash or pumpkin, grows in the center of the dark, tilled soil. A thin wooden stake is placed next to the plant for support, and over time, the number and position of the stakes change, with one or two stakes appearing at different times. Several long, black, flexible drip irrigation pipes run in parallel lines along the ground. Laid perpendicularly across these pipes are several light-colored wooden planks. In the background on the left, several black pots contain flowering plants with pink and white blossoms, but in the latter part of the video, these pots are no longer visible, and the area is instead occupied by green plants in white pots.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and the time-lapse nature of the video, but it could be more precise about the motion and the relationship between events. The use of \"followed by\" suggests a linear sequence of events, whereas in the time-lapse, the plant's growth, the placement of stakes, and the background changes all occur concurrently. A more accurate description would frame these as overlapping actions. For instance, the plant doesn't just grow; its leaves actively twist and reach upwards towards the light source as new shoots rapidly ascend from the base. The caption also misses the direct interaction with the stakes; the video clearly shows a stem being tied to the first stake for guidance, and the second stake is used to temporarily prop up a large, unfurling leaf, not just added and removed arbitrarily. Finally, describing the background plants as simply being \"replaced\" is an oversimplification; the video shows them cycling through their life stages, with flowers blooming and then wilting before the pots are swapped out, which better emphasizes the passage of time.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera smoothly pans from left to right and back again, capturing a time-lapse of a large-leafed plant dynamically growing in the center of a greenhouse. The plant's leaves twist and reach upwards towards the light as new shoots rapidly ascend from its base. A wooden stake is placed in the soil, and a stem is carefully tied to it for guidance. A second stake temporarily props up a large, unfurling leaf. In the background, potted flowers cycle through their life stages, blooming and wilting before being swapped out for different plants, while shifting shadows from outside play across the translucent walls, highlighting the passage of time.",
