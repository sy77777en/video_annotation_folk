    "pre_caption": "The girl, standing in front of a cluttered background filled with various fabrics and a trunk, initially looks upwards.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A puppet-like girl with light skin, an elongated face, and large, wide-set, expressive eyes is shown facing to her left and slightly upwards. Her dark brown hair is styled in two stiff, shiny braids that fall over her shoulders, and she wears a dark blue vest over a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. In the foreground and midground, there are piles of folded fabrics, including a bright green one and another with a blue and white floral pattern. A dark, possibly wooden or metal, trunk with a visible latch sits behind the fabrics, and further back, a pink, sack-like bundle and a red plastic basket are visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the chronological sequence of the girl's movements, but it relies on speculative language and lacks specificity. The phrase \"appearing to observe something\" violates the instruction to avoid uncertainty; a better caption would describe the concrete action, such as \"her gaze fixes on a point to her right\" or, if she interacts with an object, \"she reaches out and touches a piece of fabric hanging beside her.\" Furthermore, the descriptions of motion are too general. Instead of \"looks upwards\" and \"lowers her head,\" more descriptive verbs like \"tilts her head up\" or \"drops her chin\" would better capture the quality of the movement. Similarly, \"begins to walk\" could be improved by describing the manner of walking—for instance, \"she takes two steps to the left and exits the frame,\" which provides a more definitive and visual account of the final action. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe any interaction with the detailed background, which would ground her movements in the environment.",
