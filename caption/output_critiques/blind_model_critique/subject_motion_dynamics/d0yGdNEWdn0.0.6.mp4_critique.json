    "pre_caption": "A man stands in place while speaking, gesturing with both hands.

He occasionally points with the remote in his right hand while his left hand remains open.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A middle-aged, light-skinned man with short brown hair and a full, trimmed beard and mustache stands while speaking. He is wearing a light blue button-down shirt with a red lanyard around his neck, from which a name tag is hanging. A small black microphone is clipped to his collar. He gestures with both hands as he talks, holding a small black object, likely a presentation remote, in his right hand.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subject and the object he is holding, but it could be more specific about the nature and purpose of his movements. The phrase \"stands in place\" may be too static, as the man likely shifts his weight or turns his torso to engage with an unseen audience or a screen. The description of his gestures as simply moving \"apart and then together\" is generic; the video probably shows a variety of more specific hand movements, such as pointing with his open left hand or using his right hand to count off points. The most significant omission is the failure to describe the effect of pressing the remote. This action almost certainly causes a change on a presentation screen behind him, and describing this cause-and-effect relationship is crucial for a complete motion description. A more effective caption would connect these actions, for instance, by describing him pressing the remote to change a slide and then using a specific gesture to draw attention to the new content on the screen.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man shifts his weight and occasionally turns his torso as he speaks, engaging with an unseen audience or screen. He holds a small black remote in his right hand, which he uses to change slides on a presentation screen behind him. As he presses the remote, he gestures dynamically, such as pointing with his open left hand or using his right hand to count off points, to emphasize and draw attention to the new content displayed.",
