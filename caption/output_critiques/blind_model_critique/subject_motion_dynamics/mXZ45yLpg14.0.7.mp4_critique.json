    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video reveals a forest scene with tall, leafless trees reaching upwards, creating a stark and eerie atmosphere. As the scene progresses, a person wearing a protective suit becomes the focal point. This individual is dressed in an orange hazmat suit with a full-face respirator mask, obscuring their features. They carry a black backpack with attached equipment, including a yellow device, possibly for measuring environmental conditions. The person stands amidst the trees, suggesting a cautious exploration of the area. The overall mood is one of isolation and caution, emphasized by the protective gear and barren surroundings.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the instructions very well.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video sequence in a logical, chronological order. It correctly identifies that the initial focus is on the scenery and camera movement, which then leads to the reveal and subsequent motion of the human subject.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures all key phases of the described action:\n1.  **Initial State:** It establishes the scene with a \"low-angle shot looking up at the tops of tall, bare trees.\"\n2.  **Transition:** It details the camera movement (\"pulls back and tilts down\") that changes the viewer's perspective.\n3.  **Subject Reveal:** It explicitly notes how the subject appears (\"a person... is revealed\"), which is a key instruction.\n4.  **Subject Motion:** It provides a clear and specific description of the subject's movement (\"walking slowly and deliberately forward toward the camera's viewpoint\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the detailed guidelines:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in perfect sequence: camera looks up, camera pulls back and tilts down, person is revealed, person walks.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption correctly prioritizes motion. It describes the camera's motion because it is integral to revealing the subject, and then it describes the subject's motion with specific adverbs (\"slowly and deliberately\").\n*   **Specificity:** Instead of just \"a person walks,\" the caption uses \"walking slowly and deliberately forward,\" which is a much more specific and informative description of the action, as requested.\n*   **Handling Reveals:** The caption perfectly follows the instruction to \"describe subjects revealing,\" using the phrase \"is revealed\" to explain how the person enters the frame.\n*   **Concise and Objective:** The language is simple, natural, and free of emotional or subjective adjectives (\"slowly\" and \"deliberately\" are objective descriptors of the motion's quality). It avoids speculation and abstract descriptions.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nThe one minor point of discussion is the mention of the \"orange hazmat suit.\" The instructions state to avoid appearance details unless differentiating between subjects. However, in this case, it is a highly salient feature that adds significant clarity and context without being overly descriptive. It is a justifiable inclusion that improves the overall quality of the description.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is exceptionally well-written. It successfully navigates the complex instructions to produce a description that is accurate, complete, and highly effective.",
