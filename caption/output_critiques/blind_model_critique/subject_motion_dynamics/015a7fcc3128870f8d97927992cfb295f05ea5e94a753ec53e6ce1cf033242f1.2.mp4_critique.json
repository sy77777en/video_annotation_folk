    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with dark brown hair styled in an updo. She is wearing a white top, a large gold statement necklace, and earrings. Her expression is neutral, and she is facing forward. The woman gradually disappears from the frame, leaving the scene empty.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The woman, wearing a white top and a large gold necklace, stands in a room with hanging lanterns in the background. She begins to walk forward, her expression remaining neutral. As she continues to move, her head and body gradually move out of the frame. The room remains empty after she has completely disappeared.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nOverall, the caption is very good and adheres well to the instructions. It is clear, concise, and accurately describes the motion in chronological order.\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events: a woman is initially static, then moves forward until she is no longer in the shot, leaving an empty scene. It is factually sound.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The description is complete. It covers the subject's initial state (\"stands\"), the initiation and continuation of her movement (\"begins to walk forward,\" \"continues to move\"), and the final state of the video (\"The room remains empty\").\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** **Excellent.** The actions are presented in perfect chronological sequence: standing, walking, exiting the frame.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** **Good.** The caption primarily focuses on the woman's movement. However, the first sentence includes details about her appearance (\"wearing a white top and a large gold necklace\") and the background (\"hanging lanterns\"). The instruction states to \"avoid repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" If these details were not provided elsewhere, including them for context is acceptable. If they were, this part would be redundant. The rest of the caption correctly focuses only on motion.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** **Excellent.** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. The paragraph is coherent and gets straight to the point.\n*   **Objectivity:** **Excellent.** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. Describing her expression as \"neutral\" is an objective observation, not a subjective interpretation of her feelings.\n*   **Specificity of Action:** **Excellent.** Instead of just \"the woman moves,\" it specifies that she \"stands,\" \"begins to walk forward,\" and \"gradually move[s] out of the frame.\" This is precise and descriptive.\n*   **Handling Disappearing Subjects:** **Excellent.** The caption clearly and effectively describes how the subject leaves the shot (\"her head and body gradually move out of the frame,\" \"she has completely disappeared\").\n*   **No Speculation or Abstraction:** **Excellent.** The description is concrete and avoids any speculative language (\"might be,\" \"appears\") or abstract descriptions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It successfully follows nearly all instructions, providing a clear, objective, and chronologically accurate description of the subject's motion. Its only potential minor flaw is the inclusion of appearance details, which is only an issue if that information was already provided elsewhere. The core of the caption, which describes the movement, is a perfect example of what the instructions requested.",
