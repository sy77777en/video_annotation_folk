    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins focused on a male-presenting humanoid figure with a featureless, metallic silver head that has a red glow on its sides. The figure is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved button-down shirt, a dark grey tie, and dark blue trousers, and its metallic silver hands are resting on its lap as it sits in a black chair. The camera then trucks to the left to reveal a female-presenting humanoid figure sitting in a similar chair. This figure also has a featureless, metallic silver head, which has a blue glow on its sides and hair styled in a bun. She is dressed in a light grey pantsuit with a white shirt underneath, and she sits with her legs crossed and her metallic silver hands on her lap.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the lack of subject motion and correctly describes the camera's movement as the primary action. However, the chronological flow could be improved. The description of the camera \"trucking to the left\" is inserted between the descriptions of the two figures, which feels slightly disjointed. A more natural sequence would be to describe the initial view of the male figure, then describe the camera's movement and how it reveals the female figure, creating a continuous visual narrative. Furthermore, the caption misses an opportunity to describe the final composition of the shot. After the camera moves, are both figures visible in the frame together, or does the male figure move out of view as the female figure is revealed? Clarifying this final spatial relationship is crucial. Lastly, while the description of the figures' static poses is necessary due to the absence of other motion, the details feel listed rather than integrated. For instance, mentioning the \"metallic silver hands\" could be woven more smoothly into the description of the second figure's reveal, perhaps to emphasize the non-human or android-like nature of the subjects as they are presented side-by-side.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a male-presenting humanoid figure sitting motionless in a black chair. As the camera trucks to the left, it reveals a female-presenting humanoid figure, also sitting completely still in a similar chair. Both figures are now visible in the frame together, emphasizing their static poses and metallic silver hands, which highlight their non-human, android-like nature. The clip maintains this composition, with neither figure exhibiting any movement throughout.",
