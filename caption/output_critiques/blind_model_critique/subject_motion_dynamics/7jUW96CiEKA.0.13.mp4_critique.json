    "pre_caption": "In a serene natural setting, a group of elephants is seen near a riverbank. The background is filled with lush greenery and trees, creating a tranquil atmosphere. One elephant is closer to the river, while another is further up the bank, and a third is partially hidden among the bushes. The river flows gently, reflecting the light of the setting sun. The elephants appear to be stationary, with minimal movement, as they stand and graze near the water's edge.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n### Failures to Adhere to Instructions:\n\n1.  **Use of Emotional and Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using words like \"**serene**,\" \"**tranquil**,\" and \"**gently**.\" These words describe a mood or feeling rather than objective facts about the motion.\n2.  **Use of Speculative Statements:** The instructions forbid speculative statements like \"'it appears'.\" The caption uses the phrase \"**The elephants appear to be stationary**,\" which introduces uncertainty and is explicitly disallowed.\n3.  **Improper Focus:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to describe the scene only if there are no salient subjects. This caption dedicates the first half to describing the setting (\"serene natural setting,\" \"lush greenery and trees,\" \"river flows gently, reflecting the light of the setting sun\") instead of concisely describing the subjects' actions.\n4.  **Lack of Conciseness:** Because it focuses heavily on the background and atmosphere, the caption is not concise. The core information about the elephants' minimal movement is buried at the end of a lengthy scenic description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n*   The caption does use simple, natural English.\n*   It correctly identifies the subjects' actions (\"stand and graze\").\n*   It avoids abstract descriptions.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails on several critical points of the instructions. It is written more like a descriptive or atmospheric piece rather than the objective, motion-focused, and concise description that was requested.",
