    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person with brown, wavy hair and light skin, wearing a light-colored t-shirt, is shown from a side-rear view. They are holding a compact, dark green, rectangular phone with rounded edges to their right ear; the phone's earpiece and a small, dark, circular indentation on its back near the top are visible. To the right and slightly behind the person, a portion of a dark computer monitor is visible, its screen displaying an indistinct interface. The entire scene is illuminated by a strong yellowish-green light, affecting the coloration of all subjects.**",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is overly simplistic and potentially inaccurate. While the person's overall posture might be stationary, it's highly probable that a video of a living subject would contain subtle but important movements that are missed. For instance, the person's eyes might shift, they could be blinking, their facial expression might change subtly as they listen (e.g., a furrowed brow or a slight smile), or their fingers on the hand not holding the phone might tap or fidget. Describing the subject as completely 'still' ignores these micro-actions, which are a form of motion. A more accurate description would acknowledge these subtle movements, as they provide a more truthful and detailed account of the subject's state, differentiating them from an inanimate object like a statue.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The person holds a phone to their ear, maintaining a generally stationary posture, but subtle movements are present throughout the video. Their eyes may shift, they might blink, and their facial expression could change slightly as they listen, such as a furrowed brow or a slight smile. Additionally, their free hand might tap or fidget, adding to the nuanced motion observed.",
