    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video depicts a man with light skin, a full beard, and short dark hair, dressed in dark green military gear, including a tactical vest, gloves, and a helmet with night vision goggles. He is lying on a pile of broken bricks, holding a black rifle, and appears alert and focused. Another man, also with a light complexion, short dark hair, and a beard, is wearing a camouflage tactical vest over light-colored clothing. He leans over and extends his right hand toward the first man, suggesting a first-person perspective interaction. After being helped up, the first-person character places a gloved left hand, wearing a watch, on the shoulder of the man in the camouflage vest, indicating a moment of camaraderie or support.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is very good, but there are minor areas for improvement.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the caption accurately reflects the video's content, it correctly identifies two subjects, their distinct appearances (for differentiation), their initial positions, and their interactions.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption describes a complete and self-contained sequence of actions from a starting position to a concluding one. It successfully captures the beginning, middle, and end of the interaction.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at this. It perfectly follows the sequence of events: 1) a man is lying down, 2) another man offers help, 3) the first man gets up, 4) the first man places a hand on the other's shoulder.\n    *   **Focus on Motion & Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction between the two men (\"leans over and extends his right hand to help him up,\" \"places his gloved left hand on the shoulder\").\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and abstract descriptions.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is free of emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"appears to,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **Specificity:** It specifies key details like \"right hand\" and \"gloved left hand,\" which adds to the clarity of the motion.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Active vs. Passive Voice:** The phrase \"After being assisted to his feet\" describes the first man's motion passively. The instructions emphasize describing *how* subjects move. A more active description, such as \"The first man then uses the offered hand to get to his feet,\" would better align with this guideline by focusing on his action of rising.\n    *   **State vs. Motion:** The opening, \"The man... lies on a pile of broken bricks,\" describes a static position. While this is acceptable if the video starts with him already there, using \"is lying\" would be slightly clearer to indicate a state rather than the action of lying down. However, this is a very minor point, and the current wording is generally understood.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is effective and follows the vast majority of the instructions very well, particularly regarding chronological order and objective language. The primary suggestion for improvement is to use more active phrasing to describe the subject's own movement rather than what is being done to them.",
