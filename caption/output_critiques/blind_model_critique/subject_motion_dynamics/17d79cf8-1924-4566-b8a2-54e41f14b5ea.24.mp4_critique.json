    "pre_caption": "The person, holding a brick in their left hand and a trowel in their right hand, walks towards a partially constructed wall made of similar bricks. The person positions the brick on the wall, aligning it with the existing structure. They then press the brick into place, ensuring it is secure.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person engaged in bricklaying, holding a brick in their left hand and a trowel in their right hand. The individual, whose arms and hands are visible, has a darker skin tone and wears a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and patterned shorts. They are handling reddish-brown, rectangular bricks and are seen placing them on a partially constructed wall. The person is also wearing sandals. The scene is viewed from a head-mounted camera perspective, focusing on the construction process.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially good** but fails to fully adhere to several key instructions. While it is accurate and chronological, it includes details that were explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a logical sequence of events for a person laying a brick. The actions of walking, positioning, and pressing are described correctly and in a plausible order.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete, step-by-step description of the main subject's actions from start to finish, covering the interaction with the brick and the wall.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence: \"walks towards,\" \"positions the brick,\" and \"then press the brick.\"\n*   **Simple and Objective Language:** The language is clear, natural, and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative words.\n*   **Specific Actions:** It describes specific interactions like \"positions the brick on the wall\" and \"press the brick into place.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n    *   The caption begins by describing what the person is statically \"holding in their left hand and a trowel in their right hand,\" which is a state, not a motion.\n    *   The final sentence, \"The background includes a construction site with a bucket of mortar, some greenery, and scattered construction materials,\" is a description of the static scenery, not the subject's motion. This directly violates the core instruction.\n*   **Conciseness:** By including static details about the objects being held and the background, the caption is less concise and focused on the essential motion than it should be.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not good because it violates the fundamental instruction to focus exclusively on the subject's motion. A better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\n\"A person walks towards a partially constructed brick wall, positions a brick on top of it, and then presses the brick down to secure it in place.\"",
