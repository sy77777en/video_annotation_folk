    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two men in a well-lit indoor setting. The man on the left, who is facing the camera, is wearing a gray suit with a white shirt and a beige tie, accented by a red flower on his lapel. He has short brown hair and a clean-shaven face, appearing to be in his 30s. His expression shifts from speaking to a more neutral look. The second man, partially visible on the right and facing away from the camera, is dressed in a dark suit with a white shirt. His hair is light brown and styled neatly. Both men are standing and facing each other, suggesting a conversation or interaction between them.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Caption Feedback\n\nThe caption is partially effective but fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption is factually accurate in its description of the man's actions and the environment.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully captures the primary sequence of motion: speaking, turning the head, and then holding that position. It provides a basic, chronological account of the subject's movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions (\"is speaking and then turns his head\") are correctly presented in the order they occur.\n*   **Simple Language:** The caption uses clear, simple, and natural English.\n*   **Avoids Ambiguity:** It avoids speculative phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be\" in the description of the action itself.\n\n**Where the caption needs improvement:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n    *   **Violation:** The description of the man's attire (\"in the gray suit with a red flower on his lapel\") is an appearance detail, not motion. Since he is the only subject, this detail is unnecessary for identification.\n    *   **Violation:** The entire final sentence (\"The background shows a well-lit indoor space with white shelves and various equipment...\") is dedicated to the static background, which directly contradicts the instruction to focus on motion.\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:**\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"maintaining a serious expression\" describes a perceived emotional state. A more objective description would focus on the lack of movement or a neutral state, such as \"He continues to look in that direction with a neutral expression.\"\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:**\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"indicating an office or storage area\" is an inference about the location's function. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" The caption should only describe what is seen (e.g., \"white shelves and equipment\") without interpreting the purpose of the space.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the instructions:\n\nThe man speaks while looking forward, then turns his head to his left and continues to look in that direction.",
