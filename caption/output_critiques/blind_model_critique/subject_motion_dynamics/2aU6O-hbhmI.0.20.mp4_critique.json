    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of a tall building with a red brick facade and large glass windows, capturing the details of the balconies and the interior lights. As the camera moves, it starts to tilt and shift, gradually revealing more of the surrounding buildings and the cityscape in the background. The camera continues to rotate, providing a broader view of the urban environment, including other high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The perspective shifts further, showing the building from a different angle, with the camera now capturing the lower part of the building and the street below.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully follows several key instructions but fails on one important point regarding focus.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption accurately describes the content of a video featuring camera movement. It correctly identifies a close-up on a building that transitions into a wider cityscape view through camera motion.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption covers the entire sequence of motion from beginning to end, describing the initial shot, the transition, and the final perspective.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order (Excellent):** The description of the camera's movement is presented in a clear, chronological sequence: it \"begins with a close-up,\" then \"starts to tilt and shift,\" \"continues to rotate,\" and finally \"shifts further.\"\n*   **Objectivity (Excellent):** The caption uses simple, neutral language and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"impressive\") and speculative statements.\n*   **Format (Excellent):** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text, as requested.\n*   **Specificity of Motion (Good):** The caption uses specific verbs to describe the camera's movement, such as \"tilt,\" \"shift,\" and \"rotate.\" This is much better than a generic description like \"the camera moves around.\"\n\n*   **Focus on Motion (Needs Improvement):** This is the main weakness. The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption begins with a lengthy static description of the building (\"a tall building with a red brick facade and large glass windows, capturing the details of the balconies and the interior lights\"). This describes *what* is in the frame rather than the *motion* itself. A more compliant caption would integrate the description of the scene as a result of the camera's movement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written and follows most rules, but its primary flaw is the heavy focus on static visual details at the beginning, which detracts from the core instruction to describe motion. To be perfect, it should have been more concise and centered the description around the camera's actions from the very start.\n\n**Example of a more compliant caption:**\n\n\"The camera starts on a close-up of a brick building and then tilts and rotates, gradually revealing a wider cityscape with other high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The perspective continues to shift, eventually showing the lower part of the initial building and the street below.\"",
