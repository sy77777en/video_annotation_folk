    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of a tall building with a red brick facade and large glass windows, capturing the details of the balconies and the interior lights. As the camera moves, it starts to tilt and shift, gradually revealing more of the surrounding buildings and the cityscape in the background. The camera continues to rotate, providing a broader view of the urban environment, including other high-rise buildings and construction cranes. The perspective shifts further, showing the building from a different angle, with the camera now capturing the lower part of the building and the street below.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the provided caption and instructions.\n\nThe caption incorrectly focuses on describing the camera's movement rather than the subject's motion. The primary subject, the building, is static, a crucial detail that the caption fails to mention. Instead of stating that the building remains stationary, the description provides a technical and overly detailed breakdown of the camera's path (\"pans left and moves forward,\" \"continues to rotate and tilt\"), which violates the instruction to describe the *subject's* actions. Furthermore, by focusing so heavily on the camera, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the actual motion visible in the video, such as the cars I can see driving on the street at the base of the building or the slow, deliberate rotation of the construction cranes in the background. A more accurate description would state that the building is motionless while the camera moves to reveal its different facets, and it could have briefly noted the secondary motion of the traffic below to provide a more complete picture of the scene's activity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a close-up of a tall building with a red brick facade and large glass windows, highlighting the details of the balconies and interior lights. The building remains motionless as the camera moves, gradually revealing the surrounding cityscape. In the background, construction cranes slowly rotate, and cars drive along the street at the base of the building, adding dynamic elements to the scene. The camera shifts to show different angles of the building, capturing the urban environment and activity below.",
