They begin to turn their body to the right, gradually shifting their gaze forward. The person continues to turn, now facing more towards the front, and their head is slightly tilted. They complete the turn and start to move forward, maintaining their smile.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person with short, slightly wavy brown hair, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and a dark striped tie. Their gender is not easily determined. They are holding a book with a dark cover. The person has a light skin tone and a pronounced smile, with a slightly tilted head. The setting suggests an indoor environment with yellow doors. **",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is partially effective but has significant issues with adherence to the core instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption appears to be accurate in its description of a plausible sequence of events. It describes a person turning and then moving forward in a logical, chronological order.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption completely describes the subject's motion from a starting position through a turn and into forward movement. It covers the beginning, middle, and end of the described action.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are correctly presented in the sequence they occur: standing, beginning to turn, continuing the turn, and moving forward.\n    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language used is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The caption avoids speculative language like \"appears to\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   **Specific Actions:** It describes specific movements like \"turn their body to the right,\" \"shifting their gaze forward,\" and \"start to move forward.\"\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The most significant flaw is the first sentence. It is almost entirely dedicated to static details (\"dressed in a white shirt and tie,\" \"holding a book titled 'Virginia's Chronicles',\" \"in a room with yellow door frames and a window with sheer curtains\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to avoid mentioning appearance unless necessary to differentiate subjects. This introductory sentence violates that primary rule.\n    *   **Lack of Conciseness:** By including extensive static details, the caption is not as concise as it should be. The core motion could be described in a much shorter sentence.\n    *   **Inclusion of Unnecessary Detail:** Details like the book's title, the color of the door frames, and the type of curtains are irrelevant to the subject's motion and should have been omitted according to the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to follow the most important instruction: to focus on motion and avoid static descriptions of appearance and environment. While it successfully follows the chronological and clarity requirements, the large amount of non-motion-related information at the beginning makes it a poor example of the requested format.\n\nA better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\n**A person holding a book turns their body to the right, shifting their gaze forward as they complete the turn, and then begins to walk forward.**",
