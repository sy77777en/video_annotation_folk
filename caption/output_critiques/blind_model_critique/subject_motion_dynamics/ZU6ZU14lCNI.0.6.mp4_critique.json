  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption incorrectly focuses on describing the camera's motion (\"The camera moves forward while tilting upward\") rather than the subject's motion, which directly contradicts the instructions. The primary subject, the ceiling, is static, but the caption fails to note this as required for subjects with no movement. I imagine that the large, elaborate chandelier mentioned might be subtly swaying in the air currents of the large room, or perhaps the ring of lights flickers or slowly brightens as the camera reveals them. These potential subject movements are the exact details that should be captured. Instead, the caption provides a static architectural description using multiple, somewhat redundant adjectives like \"ornate,\" \"intricate,\" and \"elaborate,\" which is discouraged in favor of describing action. A better caption would either state that the ceiling and chandelier are stationary or describe the subtle motion of the chandelier or lights, omitting any mention of the camera's movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The ornate domed ceiling features a large green stained-glass section at its center, surrounded by intricate carvings and a ring of lights. The chandelier hanging from the apex of the dome sways gently in the air currents, while the lights flicker softly, adding a dynamic touch to the otherwise static scene.",
