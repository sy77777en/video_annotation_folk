    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two individuals in tactical gear move cautiously while holding black rifles. They are wearing black helmets and full-face gas masks with large, orange-tinted visors. Their uniforms include brownish-green jackets under tactical vests of a similar color, with solid blue square patches on the right shoulders. They are also wearing black gloves.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the two subjects and their general directions of movement, but it lacks the specific detail required by the instructions. The phrase \"moves swiftly\" is too generic; it would be more informative to specify *how* the person is moving, such as sprinting in a low crouch or walking tactically with a weapon raised. The description \"stops midway\" is a significant omission of a key action; the subject likely performs a specific motion during this pause, such as aiming a rifle, scanning the environment, or dropping to a knee, which is a crucial part of the sequence. Similarly, \"retreats\" is vague and could be improved by describing the action more precisely, for instance, \"backpedals quickly\" or \"turns and sprints for cover.\" For the second person, \"moves quickly through the foreground\" could be enhanced by describing their posture (e.g., running upright) and noting if their movement momentarily obscures the first subject. The use of \"Meanwhile\" suggests simultaneous but separate actions, failing to describe any potential coordination between the two individuals, such as one providing cover while the other advances, which would be a key element of their interaction.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person in tactical gear sprints in a low crouch from right to left across the foreground, momentarily stopping midway to scan the environment while dropping to a knee. In the background, a second person in similar gear cautiously peeks out from behind a concrete wall, providing cover before quickly backpedaling for safety. The first person's movement briefly obscures the second, suggesting a coordinated effort between the two as they navigate the area.",
