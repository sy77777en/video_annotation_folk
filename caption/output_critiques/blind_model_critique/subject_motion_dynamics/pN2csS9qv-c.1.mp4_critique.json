The gymnast walks towards her teammates, and they all raise their hands in celebration. Another gymnast in a similar red leotard joins her, and they both raise their hands together in a celebratory gesture.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of female gymnasts with light complexions and light brown hair celebrating near gymnastics equipment. They are wearing matching red leotards with sheer black sleeves and rhinestone embellishments. Their hair is styled in buns. The women are engaged in a joyful interaction, clapping and high-fiving each other. Several women in black athletic wear, possibly coaches or team members, are also visible, joining in the celebration with raised hands. The setting appears to be an indoor sports venue, indicated by the presence of gymnastic apparatus and a banner in the background.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in some aspects but fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to accurately describe a plausible sequence of events following a gymnastics routine. The actions described (finishing, being greeted, walking, celebrating) are logical and chronologically ordered.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption covers the main sequence of interactions between the gymnast and her team. However, it is not complete in its description of the motion itself. The phrase \"finishes her routine\" is a general summary rather than a description of a specific physical motion (e.g., \"lands a dismount,\" \"strikes a final pose\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, step-by-step sequence.\n*   **No Speculation:** It avoids ambiguous or speculative language like \"appears to\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Describes Interactions:** It clearly describes the interactions between the main gymnast, her teammates, and coaches (\"greeted by,\" \"walks towards,\" \"joins her\").\n*   **Describes Group Activity:** It specifies the group actions of \"clapping and cheering\" and raising hands in celebration.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption includes significant detail that is not related to motion. The description of the \"heart-shaped back design\" and the background details (\"a banner that reads 'BYUCougars' and other people watching\") violate the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\"\n*   **Unnecessary Appearance Details:** The detailed description of the leotard is not used to differentiate between subjects and is therefore superfluous according to the rule: \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\"\n*   **Lack of Specificity:** The instruction asks to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\" As mentioned, \"finishes her routine\" is a generic summary, not a description of a specific action.\n*   **Conciseness:** By including non-essential details about appearance and the background, the caption is less concise than it should be.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is not good because it violates core instructions by including unnecessary descriptive details about clothing and the static background, which detracts from the primary goal of describing motion. It also uses a generic phrase (\"finishes her routine\") where a more specific description of the action is required.",
