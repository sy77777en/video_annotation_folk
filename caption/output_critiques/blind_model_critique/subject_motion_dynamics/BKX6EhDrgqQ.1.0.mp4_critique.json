    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A 3D-rendered male figure with short, dark hair and a metallic, grey skin tone stands with his back to the viewer. He is wearing a light grey, short-sleeved t-shirt and dark pants. The figure is positioned in front of a tall, white, freestanding kiosk that has a large, blank, vertical screen. He walks closely toward the machine and pauses in front of it.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"3D-rendered male figure\" and the object as a \"kiosk.\" The described motion—walking toward the kiosk and stopping—is a precise representation of the events in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It covers the entire sequence of the subject's motion from beginning to end. It establishes the starting action (\"walks a short distance\"), the direction (\"toward a tall, white kiosk\"), and the concluding action (\"then stops directly in front of it\"), leaving out no essential part of the movement.\n\n**Adherence to the given instruction:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the sequence of events by stating the figure \"walks... and then stops.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on the actions of \"walks\" and \"stops,\" using the subject and object only to provide necessary context for the movement.\n*   **Concise and Objective:** The language is simple, clear, and free of emotional, subjective, or speculative words.\n*   **Specificity:** It avoids generic terms. Instead of \"a figure moves,\" it specifies that the figure \"walks a short distance toward\" an object and \"stops directly in front of it,\" which is a clear and specific description of the interaction.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Avoids Prohibited Content:** The caption successfully avoids abstract descriptions, ambiguity, and unnecessary details about appearance.",
