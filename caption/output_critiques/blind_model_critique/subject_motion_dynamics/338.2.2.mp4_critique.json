    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, sitting at a table with a plate of food and a glass of lemonade in front of her. The camera then pans to the right, revealing a woman in a yellow garment sitting next to her, also with a plate of food and a glass of lemonade. As the camera continues to move, it shows an older man in a maroon shirt, holding chopsticks and looking at his plate. Finally, the camera focuses on a woman in a maroon burgundy vest, who is speaking while holding chopsticks over her plate.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a swift pan to the right, revealing several individuals in a dining setting. Initially, the camera focuses on a woman wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt with a black bow tie, who has a medium skin tone and dark, tied-up hair, suggesting she might be a server. The focus then shifts to a woman in a yellow garment, with a medium skin tone and medium-length hair. Following this, an older man with glasses and short hair, dressed in a maroon shirt, is shown. Lastly, the camera highlights a woman in a maroon burgundy vest with golden-yellow trim over a black long-sleeve shirt, with dark medium-length hair. She is holding chopsticks over a plate . Although she remains stationary, she is speaking, indicating an interaction with the meal and the people around her.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to the core instructions, primarily by focusing on the camera's movement and static descriptions of the subjects rather than the subjects' own motions.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a sequence of events where the camera pans across several people sitting at a table. The details about their positions and the items in front of them are likely correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete in describing the camera's path and what is revealed.\n*   However, it is critically incomplete in describing the subjects' actions. For example, it mentions a woman is \"speaking\" but provides no detail on her gestures or expressions. It states a man is \"holding chopsticks\" but not if he is eating, gesturing, or resting them.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Failure to Focus on Subject Motion:** This is the biggest issue. The main action described is the camera's (\"pans to the right,\" \"continues to move,\" \"focuses on\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject’s motion.\" The descriptions of the people are overwhelmingly static (\"sitting at a table,\" \"looking at his plate\").\n*   **Lack of Specificity in Actions:** The instructions ask for specific actions (e.g., \"a runner sprints\"). The caption uses generic descriptions like \"sitting\" and \"speaking.\" It fails to describe *how* the subjects are moving.\n*   **Over-description of Static Details:** The caption spends significant time describing clothing (\"maroon vest,\" \"yellow garment\") and table settings (\"plate of food and a glass of lemonade\"). The instructions advise against this, stating to focus on motion and avoid details that might be in a separate description.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption does follow a chronological order, but it's the chronology of the camera pan, not a sequence of actions performed by a single subject. This is a valid interpretation, but it's poorly executed because the focus remains on the camera.\n\nIn summary, the caption reads like a shot list describing camera work rather than a description of what the people in the video are doing. It violates the most important instruction: to describe the **subject's motion**.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman in a maroon vest and white shirt sits at a table, animatedly gesturing with her hands as she talks, her expression lively and engaged. Next to her, a woman in a yellow garment nods in agreement, occasionally lifting her glass of lemonade to take a sip. An older man in a maroon shirt skillfully uses his chopsticks to pick up food from his plate, pausing to smile at the conversation. The woman in the maroon vest continues to speak, her chopsticks poised above her plate, emphasizing her points with subtle movements.",
