    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young, light-skinned man with short blond hair sits, looking down with a wide-eyed, open-mouthed expression. He is wearing a dark blue sweatshirt over a white t-shirt and holds an open blue folder in his hands. Initially, he looks toward the lower right at the folder, then turns his head to look toward the bottom left at the elderly man. In the foreground, an elderly, light-skinned man with wrinkled skin and thinning hair lies on his back in a bed, covered by a white sheet. His head rests on a pillow, his eyes are closed, and his eyelids are twitching.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively establishes the scene and chronological order of events, it could be more precise in describing the subjects' specific motions and interactions. The description of the camera \"revealing\" the scene implies the action starts after the camera move is complete; it might be more accurate to describe the younger man's glance at the folder occurring *as* the camera pulls back. The older man's movement is described as his \"mouth moves slightly,\" which is vague; a more specific description, such as \"his lips part and his jaw slackens,\" would be more informative. Furthermore, a key motion for a person lying in bed, like the slow rise and fall of their chest with each breath, is omitted. The phrase \"staring with a wide-eyed expression\" borders on subjective interpretation; a more neutral description like \"his gaze remains fixed on the older man\" would better adhere to the instructions. Finally, the caption doesn't follow through on the interaction with the folder—it could specify if the younger man places it on his lap or continues to hold it as he turns his attention, adding another layer to his sequence of actions.",

A younger man stands beside him, glancing at an open folder as the camera moves. The older man's eyelids twitch, his lips part, and his jaw slackens slightly. The younger man's gaze remains fixed on the older man, holding the folder in his hands without placing it down.",
