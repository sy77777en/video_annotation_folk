    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with extensive tattoos on both arms as he skateboards. He is wearing a blue, short-sleeved, collared shirt, dark pants, and black and white sneakers. Initially, the view is on his lower body and the skateboard, which has a dark top surface. The camera then tilts upward and to the right, capturing his entire body in the frame and revealing a light-colored baseball cap worn forward on his head. He balances on the edge of a concrete structure, and as he jumps down from the ramp, the camera tilts downward, resulting in only his upper body being visible in the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the chronological order of events but lacks the specific action verbs needed to accurately describe the skateboarder's movements. The phrase \"stops the skateboard and jumps off\" is too generic and likely misrepresents the action. It's more probable that the skateboarder performs a specific maneuver, such as planting one foot on the edge of the slope to pivot, or that he intentionally bails by jumping off the board while it is still moving. The description of the landing is also ambiguous; \"landing at the bottom of the slope\" fails to clarify if he lands on his feet and runs out of the motion or if he stumbles. Additionally, the caption neglects to describe the motion of the skateboard after the rider dismounts—a key detail would be to mention that the board rolls back down the slope, separate from the rider.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A skateboarder skillfully balances on the edge of a concrete ditch, using the tail of his board. He then executes a pivot by planting one foot on the edge, causing the skateboard to spin beneath him. As he hops up, he lands smoothly on the grassy surface at the bottom of the slope, maintaining his balance. Meanwhile, the skateboard rolls back down the slope, separate from the rider.",
