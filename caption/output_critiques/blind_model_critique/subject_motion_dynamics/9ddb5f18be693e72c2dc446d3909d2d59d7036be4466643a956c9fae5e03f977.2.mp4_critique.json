    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A yellow, dimpled golf ball, speckled with dark dirt, rests on a patch of green grass. A silver-colored golf iron with a grooved face swings into view and strikes the ball, after which both the club and the ball exit the scene. In the blurred middle ground, a person's lower leg and foot are visible. The person wears light-colored trousers and a dark-colored shoe that has a white stripe and white laces.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the sequence of events in chronological order but misses key details that would likely be prominent in such a video. Assuming the shot is a close-up and possibly in slow motion, the description could be more specific about the interaction between the club and the ball. For instance, it fails to mention the visible compression of the yellow ball against the clubface at the moment of impact or the spray of grass kicked up by the club head as it strikes. Furthermore, the description of the ball's movement is generic; it could specify the trajectory, such as if the ball launches in a low, fast arc or lifts high with a visible backspin. Finally, the caption omits the immediate setting, such as whether the ball is resting on a white tee or directly on the green fairway, which is a crucial contextual detail for the action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A silver golf club swings into the frame from the right, striking a stationary yellow golf ball resting on a white tee. In a close-up, slow-motion shot, the clubface compresses the ball visibly at the moment of impact, sending it soaring in a high arc with noticeable backspin. As the club head makes contact, a spray of grass is kicked up, adding to the dynamic scene. The ball's trajectory carries it swiftly out of view, while the club continues its upward swing, also exiting the frame.",
