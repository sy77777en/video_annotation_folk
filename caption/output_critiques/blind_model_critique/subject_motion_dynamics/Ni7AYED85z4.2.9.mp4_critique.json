  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved by removing subjective language.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of a scenery video. It describes the setting (waterfront, stone steps, city skyline), the environmental conditions (misty, cloudy, hazy sunlight), and the primary motion (gentle waves lapping).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. As the video is a scenery shot without a salient moving subject (like a person or animal), the instructions state to \"briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" The caption does exactly this, providing a concise, three-sentence description of the scene and its ambient motion, which is the correct approach.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Follows Scenery Shot Rule:** The caption correctly identifies the video type and adheres to the specific instruction for scenery shots.\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear picture of the scene in a brief paragraph.\n    *   **Describes Motion:** It correctly identifies and describes the motion of the waves (\"waves lapping against stone steps\").\n    *   **No Speculation:** It avoids speculative language like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   **Simple Language:** The English is natural and easy to understand.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses \"scenic\" and \"tranquil,\" which describe the quality and mood of the scene rather than objective facts. A more compliant caption would omit these words. For example, instead of \"The video captures a scenic waterfront view,\" it could say, \"The video shows a waterfront view.\"",
