    "pre_caption": "Two silhouettes grapple, with the figure on the left initially holding an object resembling a gun. They struggle, and the figure on the right appears to disarm the left figure, causing the left figure to briefly crouch. The right figure then delivers a downward strike towards the crouching figure. The left figure rises, and the two resume grappling, moving towards the right as a large jellyfish graphic rises into view behind them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video depicts the silhouettes of two men engaged in a physical confrontation, set against a brightly lit blue background that resembles glass. Initially, the person on the left is holding a gun and engages in close combat with the person on the right. After firing the gun, the right person grabs and discards it. Both figures, appearing to wear suits or similar formal attire, grapple and exchange blows on the left side of the screen. As the sequence unfolds, a large jellyfish graphic gradually emerges from below, adding a surreal element to the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's chronological order is confusing, particularly regarding the disarming sequence. It states the left figure is disarmed, but later says the right figure kicks the left one \"to take the gun,\" which implies the gun is still in play. A more accurate description would be that the right figure twists the left figure's arm, causing the gun to fall to the ground. The left figure then elbows the right, and the right figure responds with a kick to knock the left figure away from the fallen weapon before attempting to retrieve it. The description of the gunshot could be more specific by mentioning the visible muzzle flash that briefly illuminates the scene. Additionally, the term \"grapple\" is used generically; specifying the type of struggle, such as a standing clinch that transitions to wrestling on the ground, would provide a clearer picture of the fight's progression. The final movement could be described as the two figures wrestling on the floor for control of the gun as they roll toward the left.",
