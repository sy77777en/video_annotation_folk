    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features three people around a table with various bottles and jars on a rotating tray. In the center is an older man with short gray hair and glasses, wearing a yellow shirt and a beige vest. To his left stands a woman with medium-length dark hair and bangs, dressed in a teal jumpsuit over a blue shirt, with her hands in her pockets. On his right is another woman with long dark hair, wearing a pink sweater. The table is covered with a light blue tablecloth, and the bottles and jars are arranged on a black tray. The setting appears to be a dining room with patterned wallpaper and framed pictures on the wall.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and the chronological order of events, but it lacks specificity regarding the motion. The description of the man's action could be more precise; for instance, the video might show him leaning forward and deliberately pressing the button with his right index finger. The phrase \"start rotating\" is too general; a better description would specify the direction and quality of the movement, such as \"the tray begins to rotate clockwise at a slow, steady pace.\" Furthermore, describing the women as simply \"stationary\" is likely inaccurate, as they probably turn their heads to follow the spinning bottles, a subtle but important motion that should be noted. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the effect of the rotation on the objects themselves, such as how the labels on the jars come into and out of view as the tray turns.",
