    "pre_caption": "The video shows a track race with several athletes running. The most prominent subject, a man in a blue athletic outfit, sprints energetically on the right side of the track. Behind him, an athlete in a white and blue outfit follows closely. A third runner, wearing a yellow and black outfit, is positioned behind the second athlete. On the left side, a fourth athlete in a red outfit runs near the edge of the track. All athletes maintain a steady pace, focused on the race, highlighting the competitive nature of the event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features several athletes running on a track. The most prominent subject is a man in a blue athletic outfit, sprinting energetically. He is positioned towards the right side of the track. Another athlete, wearing a white and blue outfit, is behind the first one. A third runner, in a yellow and black outfit, is positioned behind the second one. Additionally, a fourth athlete, wearing a red outfit, can be seen near the left side of the track. All subjects are focused on the race, displaying determined expressions. The scene captures the intensity and competitive nature of a track event.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it accurately identifies the subjects and their relative positions, it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is not good:\n\n**1. Violation of \"Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives\":**\n*   The caption describes the main subject as sprinting \"**energetically**.\" This is a subjective interpretation of the action, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n\n**2. Violation of \"Avoid Abstract Descriptions\" and \"Avoid Describing Anything Not Visible or Uncertain\":**\n*   The caption states the athletes are \"**focused on the race**.\" This is a speculative statement about their mental state, which is not a visible motion.\n*   The final phrase, \"**highlighting the competitive nature of the event**,\" is an abstract interpretation of the scene's meaning. The instructions specifically warn against this (e.g., \"avoid... 'emphasizing its speed and agility'\").\n\n**3. Inconsistent Specificity in Action Verbs:**\n*   The caption uses the specific verb \"sprints\" for the first runner but then uses the more generic verb \"runs\" for another. The instructions encourage using specific verbs (\"a runner sprints across the finish line\" instead of \"a person is running\"). The description would be stronger if it used consistently specific language or explained the difference in their movements.\n\n**4. Use of Unnecessary Introductory Text:**\n*   The caption begins with \"The video shows...,\" which is redundant. The instructions ask for only the one-paragraph description without introductory text.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it includes subjective, speculative, and abstract language, all of which are explicitly prohibited by the instructions. It should focus strictly on describing the observable, physical movements of the athletes in simple, objective terms.",
