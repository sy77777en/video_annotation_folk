    "pre_caption": "From a low-angle perspective, the camera cranes upwards and rotates, causing the view of the three people to spin within the frame. A person in a red shirt and another in a white shirt hold a child dressed in green between them. As the camera continues its upward and rotational movement, the group appears to turn, revealing more of the room's checkered ceiling and a framed picture on the wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a scene captured from a camera craning upwards, three people are grouped in the center. One person, positioned on the right, wears a bright red long-sleeved shirt and grey pants, holding the child in the middle. The second individual, being held in the middle, is dressed in a green top and white shorts, and is also wearing red socks and brown shoes. The third person, clad in a white shirt, stands on the left, appearing to support the child in the middle.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subjects and the general camera motion, but it contains a significant logical inconsistency and misses a key subject interaction. The description of the camera \"craning upwards without any rotation\" from a \"bird's-eye perspective\" conflicts with the statement that \"framed pictures on the wall briefly appear near the center.\" For this to happen, the camera must also be tilting backward as it moves up, changing its angle from looking down to looking forward. The current description is geometrically impossible. Furthermore, stating the subjects are merely \"stationary\" is an oversimplification; in the video, the child in green is not passive but actively looks up and smiles directly into the camera as it moves away, creating a focal point of interaction that the caption completely omits. A more accurate description would clarify the camera's tilting motion and include the child's specific action of looking and smiling at the camera.",
