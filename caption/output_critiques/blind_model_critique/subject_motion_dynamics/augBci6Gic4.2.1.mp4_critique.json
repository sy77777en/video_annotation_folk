    "pre_caption": "A woman stands over a seated man, gesturing with her hands as she speaks. She then turns, walks past his left side, and moves to a position behind him. While behind him, she continues to gesture emphatically, at one point raising her fist. The man remains seated throughout, looking up at her initially and then looking forward as she moves out of his direct line of sight.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with a serious expression stands over a seated man in a dimly lit space. She wears a black and white striped, long-sleeved shirt with a scoop neck and a black turban-style headwrap, gesturing with her hands while speaking. The man, who is sitting and looking up at her, has short blond hair and a light beard. He is dressed in a red and white plaid button-up shirt, worn open over a grey t-shirt, with the sleeves rolled up. His expression is one of concern as he listens to the woman. Then, she turns and walks past him on his left, moving to stand behind him on his left side. As she continues to talk, the man seems to be deep in thought, occasionally glancing back at her. His response eventually makes her laugh.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully outlines the woman's movement in chronological order, but it relies on speculative language and omits a key interaction. The phrase \"the man seems to contemplate her words\" is an interpretation of his internal state, violating the instruction to describe only visible actions; it would be better to describe his physical posture, such as \"the man leans forward, looking down and stroking his chin.\" A more significant issue is the gap in the narrative where the caption states \"His response prompts her to laugh\" without describing the response itself. The video likely shows the man making a specific facial expression, gesture, or unheard comment, and this observable action should be included to explain the cause of her laughter. For example, the caption could state, \"the man looks up at her and smirks, prompting her to laugh.\" Finally, while \"raising her fist\" is a good, concrete detail, the initial description of her \"gesturing with her hands\" is generic. Specifying the nature of these gestures earlier—for instance, \"she points at him with her index finger\" or \"she makes chopping motions with her hand\"—would provide a clearer picture of their interaction from the start.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman stands over a seated man, pointing at him with her index finger as she speaks. She then turns, walks past his left side, and moves to a position behind him. While behind him, she continues to gesture emphatically, at one point raising her fist. The man remains seated throughout, initially leaning forward, looking down and stroking his chin. As she moves out of his direct line of sight, he looks up at her and smirks, prompting her to laugh.",
