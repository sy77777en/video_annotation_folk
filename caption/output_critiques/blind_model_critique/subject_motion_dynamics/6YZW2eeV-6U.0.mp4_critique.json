    "pre_caption": "The video shows three individuals walking through a narrow, ancient stone passage with high walls on either side. The first person, wearing an orange top and black pants, leads the group, followed by the second person in a white hat, striped shirt, and denim shorts with a red backpack. The third person, wearing a blue and white jacket, appears from the lower right of the frame and follows the group. The pathway is paved with red bricks, and there are shadows cast on the walls, indicating the presence of sunlight. The group continues to walk forward, with the second person gradually moving ahead of the third person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video, filmed from a first-person POV, follows three people walking through an ancient structure. Initially, the first person, wearing an orange top, black trousers, and carrying a blue backpack, leads the group. The second person, following closely, is dressed in a white hat, a striped shirt, and denim shorts, carrying a red backpack. Later, a third person appears from the lower right of the frame, positioned at the very end, with only his upper body visible, wearing a blue and white jacket. The people occupy only half the frame's height, emphasizing the ancient stone walls and pathway surrounding them.**",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is partially effective but fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption appears to be an accurate description of the subjects and their movements within a plausible video scene. It correctly identifies three individuals and describes their general motion and relative positioning.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption is reasonably complete in describing the primary motion. It establishes the order of the individuals, notes when a new person enters the frame, and describes the ongoing forward movement and a change in relative positions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several specific negative constraints and fails to fully embrace the core focus of the instructions.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** It successfully presents the actions in the order they occur: the group is walking, a third person appears, and then the group continues with a change in formation.\n*   **Describes Subject Interaction:** It notes the relative motion between subjects, such as \"followed by the second person\" and \"the second person gradually moving ahead of the third person.\"\n*   **Describes Subject Revealing:** It correctly points out that \"The third person... appears from the lower right of the frame.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Includes Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n*   **Over-describes Appearance:** It provides excessive detail about each person's clothing (\"orange top and black pants,\" \"white hat, striped shirt, and denim shorts with a red backpack,\" \"blue and white jacket\"). The instructions state to \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate,\" and while differentiation is needed, it could have been done more concisely (e.g., \"the person in orange,\" \"the person in the white hat\").\n*   **Focuses on Scenery, Not Motion:** The sentence, \"The pathway is paved with red bricks, and there are shadows cast on the walls, indicating the presence of sunlight,\" describes the static environment. This violates the core instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\"\n*   **Uses Subjective/Inferential Language:** The word \"ancient\" is a subjective judgment. The phrase \"indicating the presence of sunlight\" is an inference, not a direct description of visible content, bordering on the speculative statements the instructions warn against.\n*   **Lacks Conciseness:** Due to the inclusion of unnecessary appearance and scenery details, the caption is not as concise as it could be. The focus is diluted from the primary goal of describing motion.",

The person in orange leads, followed by the one in a white hat and the third person in a blue and white jacket, who enters from the lower right.
