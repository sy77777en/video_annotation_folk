    "pre_caption": "A stylized white ship is depicted from a top-down view on a grid over a dark background, with a red dashed line connecting its bow to a small red dot. While the ship remains stationary, the longitude and latitude coordinates displayed on the screen steadily increase. A large, red dashed square is then drawn in a clockwise direction, starting from the left and progressively forming around the ship and the red dot until it is fully enclosed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A stylized, white ocean liner is shown from a top-down perspective on a black, textured background that resembles dark water. The scene is overlaid with a white grid and a white, rectangular frame with markings that enhance the visual structure. A compass icon is in the lower-left corner, and labels for longitude and latitude display changing numerical values. A glowing, red dashed line extends from the bow of the ship toward a small, glowing red dot. As the video progresses, a large, red dashed square forms, enclosing both the ship and the red dot.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main sequence of events, it could offer more precision regarding the motion and animation. The description of the ship's movement is slightly ambiguous; clarifying that the ship remains static in the center of the frame while the grid moves underneath it to simulate travel would better describe the visual effect. The statement that the coordinates \"steadily increase\" is vague; specifying whether both latitude and longitude are increasing would provide a clearer indication of the ship's directional heading. Furthermore, the animation of the square could be described more explicitly; instead of \"drawn in a clockwise direction, starting from the left,\" it would be more accurate to state that the left, top, right, and bottom sides of the square appear sequentially in a clockwise order. Finally, the caption could clarify the temporal relationship between the coordinate changes and the square's appearance—for instance, by noting if the coordinates stop changing before the square begins to form around the ship's final position.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A stylized white ship is depicted from a top-down view, stationary in the center of the frame, on a grid over a dark background. The grid moves underneath the ship to simulate travel, with a red dashed line connecting the ship's bow to a small red dot. The longitude and latitude coordinates displayed on the screen both steadily increase, indicating a northeastward heading. Once the coordinates stop changing, a large red dashed square begins to form around the ship and the red dot. The square's sides appear sequentially in a clockwise order: first the left side, then the top, followed by the right, and finally the bottom, fully enclosing the ship and the red dot.",
