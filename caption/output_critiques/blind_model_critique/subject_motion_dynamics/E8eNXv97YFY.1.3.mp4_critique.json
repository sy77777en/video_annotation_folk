    "pre_caption": "From a viewpoint at the rear of a ferry, the vessel moves forward across the water, creating a churning wake. On the deck, several cars are parked with passengers standing and sitting around them, all moving along with the boat. In the distance, a city skyline at sunset moves across the frame as the ferry progresses on its journey.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately sets the scene from the rear of the ferry but misses opportunities to describe more specific and dynamic motions. The description of passengers as simply \"standing and sitting\" is too general; the video likely shows more nuanced actions, such as a person leaning on the railing with their hair blowing in the wind, another raising a phone to capture the sunset, or a small group gesturing as they talk. The phrase \"moves across the frame\" for the skyline is also imprecise; from a rear-facing view, the skyline would be receding and shrinking into the distance, a detail that better conveys the ferry's forward progress. Furthermore, the caption omits a key element of motion that is almost certainly present: several seagulls are likely circling and gliding just above the churning wake, occasionally diving towards the water. A more effective description would integrate these specific actions, noting how the ferry moves steadily away from the receding skyline as the wake spreads behind it, while on deck, individual passengers interact with the environment and seagulls follow the vessel's path.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a viewpoint at the rear of a ferry, the vessel steadily moves forward across the water, creating a churning wake that spreads behind it. On the deck, passengers engage with their surroundings: one leans on the railing, hair blowing in the wind, while another raises a phone to capture the vibrant sunset. A small group gestures animatedly as they converse. Above, several seagulls circle and glide, occasionally diving towards the water. In the distance, the city skyline recedes and shrinks into the horizon, emphasizing the ferry's forward journey.",
