    "pre_caption": "In a gymnasium filled with spectators, a female gymnast in a red leotard performs on the uneven bars, executing a series of flips and rotations. A coach, dressed in black, stands nearby, initially walking and then bending down to observe the gymnast's performance closely. The gymnast completes her routine and dismounts from the bars, landing on the mat with a perfect landing. The coach and other individuals around her react with excitement and applause, celebrating her successful performance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a gymnastics event with a focus on a female gymnast performing on the uneven bars. She is wearing a red leotard and is captured in motion, showcasing her athleticism and skill. Around her, several individuals are present, including coaches and judges. The coaches, dressed in dark clothing, are positioned near the gymnast, likely providing support and guidance. Judges are seated at a table, observing the performance. In the background, spectators are visible in the stands, watching the event. The setting is a gymnasium with banners and equipment indicating a competitive gymnastics environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the main sequence of events in a chronological and understandable manner. However, it violates several key instructions, particularly regarding the use of subjective, emotional, and interpretive language.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption appears to be factually accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (gymnast, coach, spectators), the setting (gymnasium), and the core actions (performing on uneven bars, dismounting, reacting).\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a complete narrative arc of the main action, from the start of the routine to the reaction after the landing.\n*   It describes the motion of the primary subject (gymnast) and the key secondary subject (coach), as well as the collective action of the crowd, which aligns with the instructions.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, chronological sequence: the gymnast performs, the coach watches, the gymnast dismounts, and the crowd reacts.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption focuses on the subjects' movements (e.g., \"executing a series of flips and rotations,\" \"dismounts from the bars,\" \"landing on the mat\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is contained in a single, coherent paragraph and uses relatively simple English.\n*   **Subject Differentiation:** It uses appearance (\"red leotard,\" \"dressed in black\") to effectively differentiate between the gymnast and the coach.\n\n**Weaknesses (Violations of Instructions):**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" is violated by the phrase \"**perfect** landing.\" A more objective description would focus on the physical action, such as \"landing upright on the mat without taking a step.\"\n*   **Use of Emotional and Interpretive Language:** The instruction to avoid emotional language is violated in the final sentence.\n    *   \"react with **excitement**\" describes an internal emotion rather than an observable action. A better description would be \"clap their hands and cheer.\"\n    *   \"**celebrating her successful performance**\" is an interpretation of the crowd's intent and a judgment on the performance (\"successful\"). The instruction is to describe the motion, not the reason behind it.\n*   **Minor Chronological Confusion:** The phrase \"A coach... **stands nearby, initially walking**\" is slightly confusing. The actions are not in a clear sequence. It would be better phrased as \"A coach... walks nearby and then stands\" or \"A coach... walks nearby before bending down.\"\n*   **Slightly Abstract Description:** While not a major violation, \"performs on the uneven bars\" is a bit general. It is immediately improved by the more specific \"executing a series of flips and rotations,\" but the description could be more direct by starting with the specific actions.",
