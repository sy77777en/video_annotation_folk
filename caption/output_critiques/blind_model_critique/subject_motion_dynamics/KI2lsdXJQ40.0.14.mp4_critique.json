    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person with light skin and short, dark brown hair appears outside the car, initially visible only as a faint face through the left window. The person then opens the trunk, revealing more of their upper body in a medium shot. They are wearing a dark jacket and a yellow scarf, and their expression is neutral. The person places a dark-colored bag inside the trunk, then attempts to close it. As the trunk closes, only their hand, which is light-skinned and unadorned, remains visible as it pushes the trunk lid down.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly outlines the sequence of events in chronological order and astutely notes how the rising trunk lid reveals more of the person, it could be more specific about the mechanics of the motion. The phrase 'opens the trunk' is vague; for instance, the video might show the person pressing a button on the lid to unlatch it before manually lifting it, which is a more descriptive action. Similarly, 'causing the trunk lid to rise' is passive and doesn't clarify if it's a powered liftgate or a manual action. The description of placing the bag could also be enhanced; instead of just 'place,' the video might show them carefully setting a duffel bag down with both hands. Finally, 'push the trunk lid down' is slightly inaccurate for the entire motion; a more precise description might be that the person first pulls the lid downward and then applies a final push to latch it securely shut.",
