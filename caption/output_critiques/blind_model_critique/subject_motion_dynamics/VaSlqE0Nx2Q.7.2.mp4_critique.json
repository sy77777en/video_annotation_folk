    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young boy with light skin walks through a wooded area. He is dressed in what appears to be early 20th-century attire, consisting of a dark, single-breasted jacket, dark knickerbockers, light-colored knee-high socks, dark boots, and a dark flat cap on his head. He navigates through a forest of tall, thin trees, passing a large fallen tree on the ground. A thin white string is tied between the standing trees, and the boy walks alongside it.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the chronological order of the boy's movement, but it could be more specific about the quality and cause of his actions. The phrase \"navigates through a wooded area\" is too general; the description would be more effective if it focused on the concrete actions. For example, the video might show that his turn to the right is not just a random change of direction but is dictated by him following the curve of the path marked by the white string. The description of his initial pace as \"almost running\" could be more descriptive; perhaps he is skipping or jogging playfully before his energy wanes. Furthermore, the caption mentions the \"uneven ground\" but fails to describe how this terrain affects his movement, such as causing him to occasionally stumble, shorten his stride, or look down to carefully place his feet. The interaction with the string is also understated; the video might show him periodically reaching out to touch or lightly pull on the string for guidance or balance, a key detail of his motion that is currently missing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A young boy enters the frame from the right, skipping playfully as he moves left through a wooded area. He follows a path marked by a thin white string tied between the trees, occasionally reaching out to touch or lightly pull on it for guidance. His pace is energetic, almost a jog, but as he navigates the grassy, uneven ground, he sometimes stumbles or shortens his stride, carefully watching his steps to maintain balance. His turn to the right is guided by the curve of the path, dictated by the string, rather than a random change of direction.",
