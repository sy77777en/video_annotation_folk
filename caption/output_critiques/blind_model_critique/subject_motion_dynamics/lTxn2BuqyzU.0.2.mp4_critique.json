    "pre_caption": "The boy, standing in a well-lit room with a blurred background, picks up a slice of watermelon from a tray on the table. He prepares to take a big bite, tilting his head back and closing his eyes momentarily. As he opens his mouth wide, his eyes remain open, and he looks to the left with a surprised expression. The watermelon slices on the tray remain unchanged throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young, light-skinned boy with short, dark brown hair styled in a bowl cut with an undercut. He is wearing a white collared shirt under a dark green knitted vest. Initially, the boy tilts his head back with his eyes open, holding the watermelon slice in both hands, ready to take a big bite. Just before biting, he briefly closes his eyes. Subsequently, his eyes are wide open, revealing large, dark pupils, and they glance off to the left, while his mouth is agape in a surprised or shocked expression, still holding the watermelon slice. In front of him, on a light-colored tray, are several other bright red watermelon slices with green rinds and black seeds.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully establishes a chronological sequence of events, but it could be more precise and objective in its description of the motion. The phrase \"prepares to take a big bite\" is an interpretation of intent rather than a description of a physical action; it would be more accurate to state that he \"raises the slice toward his mouth.\" There is also a significant contradiction regarding the boy's eyes, as the caption says he \"clos[es] his eyes momentarily\" but then states \"his eyes remain open\" as he opens his mouth, creating confusion about the sequence. The use of the subjective adjective \"surprised\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional language; a more objective description, such as \"he abruptly turns his head to the left as his eyes widen,\" would better describe the physical movement. Lastly, mentioning that the watermelon slices on the tray \"remain unchanged\" is superfluous, as the focus should be on the subject's motion, not the lack of motion in background objects.",
