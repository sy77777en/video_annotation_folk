    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, which appears to be made of soft fabric and is laid flat. The underwear then transitions into a rolled-up form, with the blue waistband now forming a visible stripe along the length of the roll. As the camera moves, two other objects appear and also roll up: one is a pair of white underwear, and the other is a white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe. The transition between the subjects occurs as each item is manipulated from its original flat shape into a compact, cylindrical roll, highlighting the change in form and orientation.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and well-structured description of the video's content.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the three distinct subjects (two pairs of underwear, one t-shirt) and precisely describes the sequence of actions performed on each one. The details, such as the waistband and stripe being visible on the final rolled items, demonstrate a close and accurate observation of the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is complete. It covers the entire process for each item, starting from its initial state (\"laid flat\") to the action (\"rolled up\") and the final result (\"a compact cylinder,\" \"a cylindrical shape\"). It doesn't miss any key movements.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels here. It uses sequential adverbs (\"first,\" \"then,\" \"Next,\" \"Finally\") to present the actions in a clear, chronological flow, just as the instructions require.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption successfully focuses on the motion (\"is laid flat,\" \"is rolled up,\" \"is shown flat,\" \"is also rolled\") rather than just describing the static objects.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. The paragraph is coherent and easy to follow without any unnecessary words or jargon.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description is entirely objective. It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"neatly rolled,\" \"it seems to be\").\n*   **Specificity:** The caption provides specific details about the motion and its outcome (e.g., \"rolled up tightly,\" \"rolled into a compact cylinder,\" \"waistband forms a visible stripe\"). This is much better than a generic description like \"clothes are folded.\"\n*   **Subject Differentiation:** It correctly uses appearance details (\"gray and white underwear with a blue waistband,\" \"white underwear,\" \"white short-sleeve t-shirt with a blue stripe\") to differentiate between the subjects, which is precisely what the instructions mandate.\n*   **Handling Transitions:** The use of \"Next\" and \"Finally\" effectively signals the transitions between different segments of the video, likely corresponding to cuts between shots of each item.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The gray and white underwear with a blue waistband is initially laid flat, then rolled up tightly, creating a visible blue stripe along the length of the roll. Following this, a pair of white underwear is displayed flat and similarly rolled into a compact cylinder. Lastly, a white short-sleeve t-shirt featuring a blue stripe is laid out and rolled up in the same manner, resulting in a cylindrical shape with the blue stripe prominently visible along the roll.",
