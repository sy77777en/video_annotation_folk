    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A digital interface on a black screen displays a white grid over a dark, marbled background. In the center, the words \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" are shown in glowing red text, next to a pulsating red circle that marks a location. White text boxes on the grid indicate the coordinates \"LONG: 50.14\" and \"LAT: 41.46\". In the bottom right corner, a timestamp progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME\". As time advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the initial red circle. A white, diamond-shaped compass symbol is visible in the bottom left corner.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the chronological order of events, starting with the pulsating circle and the subsequent extension of the dotted line. However, it could be more precise in its description of the motion. For instance, stating the line extends 'vertically upwards' is ambiguous for a map; specifying that it extends 'north' or 'north-northwest' would provide clearer geographical context. The term 'pulsates' could also be more descriptive; clarifying whether the circle grows and shrinks in size or changes in color intensity would improve accuracy. Furthermore, the caption omits potentially crucial details about the timestamp, such as whether it displays the date and time advancing minute by minute, which is key to the narrative. It also fails to mention if other animated elements appear, such as an icon for the rescue ship *Carpathia* moving toward the distress call location as the line extends, which would be a significant interaction on the map. Finally, while the description of the swirling background is noted, its motion is secondary to the primary data visualization, and the caption might better serve the viewer by focusing more on the specific progression of the line and any accompanying labels that appear over time.",
