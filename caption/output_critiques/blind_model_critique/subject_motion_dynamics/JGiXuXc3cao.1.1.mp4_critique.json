    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A digital interface on a black screen displays a white grid over a dark, marbled background. In the center, the words \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" are shown in glowing red text, next to a pulsating red circle that marks a location. White text boxes on the grid indicate the coordinates \"LONG: 50.14\" and \"LAT: 41.46\". In the bottom right corner, a timestamp progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME\". As time advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the initial red circle. A white, diamond-shaped compass symbol is visible in the bottom left corner.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the motion of the graphical elements in what is clearly an animated map. The use of specific verbs like \"pulsates,\" \"advances,\" \"extends,\" and \"shifts and swirls\" precisely captures the distinct movements of each element on the screen.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, identifying all key moving parts and their actions. It covers the primary subject (the pulsating circle and extending line), the element driving the action (the advancing timestamp), and the secondary motion of the background. It also correctly notes the static nature of the grid lines, providing a useful point of reference.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in a logical sequence: the circle pulsates, the timestamp advances, and as a result, the line extends.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely centered on motion, using strong, specific action verbs.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that conveys all necessary information without unnecessary words. The inclusion of \"marking the location of the Titanic distress call\" is a good judgment call, as it provides essential context that makes the description of the motion meaningful, rather than being a redundant detail.\n*   **Objective and Factual:** The language is simple, direct, and free of emotional, subjective, or speculative terms (e.g., \"appears,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Specific Descriptions:** It avoids generic descriptions. For example, instead of \"a circle blinks and a line appears,\" it uses the more descriptive \"a red circle... pulsates\" and \"a dotted red line extends vertically upwards.\"\n*   **No Abstract Language:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids abstract interpretations like \"emphasizing the unfolding tragedy.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.",
