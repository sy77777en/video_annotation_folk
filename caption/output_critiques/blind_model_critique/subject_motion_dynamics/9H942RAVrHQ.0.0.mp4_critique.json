    "pre_caption": "A black line-drawn hand with five fingers grasps a white circular ball, which remains solid white. The hand moves out of the frame, and the ball is thrown, reverting to a black outline. Upon hitting a gridded surface, the ball briefly deforms into an oval before bouncing back up and returning to its circular shape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a black line-drawn human hand, featuring five fingers and a portion of an arm, interacting with a circular object. The hand grasps the object, which is then thrown. It bounces three times in the same position and briefly deforms into an oval each time as it makes contact with a gridded surface, before bouncing back up and regaining its circular form.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the initial action, as the video likely shows the hand entering the frame from the left before it grasps the ball. The description of the throw, \"turns upwards and throws the ball in the same direction,\" is vague; it would be more descriptive to specify the type of throw, such as an \"underhand toss,\" and the resulting trajectory, like \"sending it in an arc toward the right.\" The most significant issue is the description of the bounce: the statement that the ball deforms \"before it touches the surface\" is physically impossible. The caption should clarify that the ball deforms *upon impact* with the surface. Furthermore, the description misses key details of the bouncing motion, such as the fact that the ball moves horizontally across the frame and that the height of each successive bounce decreases.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A black line-drawn hand with five fingers enters the frame from the left and grasps a solid white circular ball. The hand turns upwards and performs an underhand toss, sending the ball in an arc toward the right. As the ball hits a gridded surface, it briefly deforms into an oval upon impact before bouncing back up. The ball returns to its circular shape and moves horizontally across the frame, with each successive bounce reaching a lower height.",
