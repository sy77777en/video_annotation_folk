    "pre_caption": "On a street lined with traditional shops adorned with lanterns and signs, a group of people walk along the sidewalk. A woman in a brown jacket and black shorts, wearing a mask, turns her head to look at a shop display. She continues to walk forward, glancing at the shop window, which showcases various items. The woman then stops and stands still, closely examining the shop display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good, but it could be improved by being more concise and focusing more strictly on motion.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate. It describes a plausible and logical sequence of events: a person walking, getting distracted by a shop, slowing down, and then stopping to look more closely. The actions are described in a way that is easy to visualize.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It captures the general motion of the background group and then provides a detailed, step-by-step account of the main subject's actions from start to finish.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in perfect chronological sequence: walking with the group -> turning her head -> continuing to walk while glancing -> stopping to examine.\n*   **Focus on a Main Subject:** It correctly identifies a main subject (the woman) and details her movements, while briefly mentioning the secondary subjects (\"a group of people walk\").\n*   **Specific Actions:** It uses specific verbs to describe motion, such as \"turns her head,\" \"glancing,\" and \"stops and stands still.\"\n*   **Object Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction with the shop display (\"look at a shop display,\" \"examining the shop display\").\n*   **Clarity and Objectivity:** The language is simple, natural, and avoids subjective or speculative statements.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Excessive Detail on Appearance:** The caption describes the woman \"in a brown jacket and black shorts, wearing a mask.\" The instructions state to avoid appearance details unless needed to differentiate between subjects. Since she is the only subject described in detail, this information is unnecessary and detracts from the focus on motion.\n*   **Excessive Detail on Scenery:** The opening, \"On a street lined with traditional shops adorned with lanterns and signs,\" is very descriptive of the environment. The instructions emphasize focusing on the subject's motion and avoiding details that might be covered elsewhere. This level of scene-setting is not required.\n*   **Conciseness:** By removing the unnecessary details about appearance and scenery, the caption could be more concise and impactful, better adhering to the core instruction to focus on motion.\n\n### Revised Example\n\nFor comparison, here is a version that more strictly follows all instructions:\n\n\"A group of people walk along a sidewalk. One woman turns her head to look at a shop display, continues walking while glancing at the window, and then stops to examine the items.\"",
