    "pre_caption": "A man in a light yellow polo shirt is seated at a table in a restaurant, with a folded napkin in front of him. He begins speaking, and his head moves slightly as he talks. The background shows other people moving around, indicating a busy restaurant environment. The man then raises his right hand and gives a thumbs-up gesture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man seated at a table in a restaurant. He has a medium-dark skin tone and is wearing a light yellow polo shirt. His hair is short and dark. The man is facing forward with a calm expression. The table in front of him is set with a folded napkin. In the background, there are other people, slightly blurred, moving around, suggesting a busy restaurant environment. The setting includes ornate decor with a circular design behind the man, adding a decorative element to the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved for better adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events in chronological order. The actions described (sitting, speaking, giving a thumbs-up) are clear and factually presented.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete, covering the subject's initial state, primary actions, and the movement of secondary subjects in the background. It provides a full, albeit brief, summary of the motion in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at this, clearly stating the sequence of events: the man is seated, he begins speaking, and *then* he gives a thumbs-up.\n    *   **Specificity of Action:** It uses specific descriptions of motion like \"his head moves slightly as he talks\" and \"raises his right hand and gives a thumbs-up gesture,\" which is much better than a generic description like \"the man moves.\"\n    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n    *   **Secondary Subjects:** It correctly mentions the background motion (\"other people moving around\") concisely, as instructed.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The very first sentence (\"A man in a light yellow polo shirt is seated at a table in a restaurant, with a folded napkin in front of him\") focuses heavily on static details (clothing, setting, objects) rather than motion. The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" A better approach would be to integrate the description of the subject with their first action.\n    *   **Inference vs. Description:** The phrase \"indicating a busy restaurant environment\" is an interpretation of the visual data, not a direct description of motion. While it's a logical conclusion, the instructions favor pure description. A more compliant alternative would be to simply state, \"In the background, other people move around the restaurant.\"\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of how the caption could be revised to better align with all instructions:\n\nA man in a light yellow polo shirt, seated at a restaurant table, begins speaking, causing his head to move slightly. In the background, other people move around the room. The man then raises his right hand and makes a thumbs-up gesture.",
