    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a hand holding a yellow walkie-talkie with a black antenna and buttons, partially visible in the bottom center-left. The hand appears to be of a person with medium skin. The background consists of a rocky landscape with scattered trees and a cloudy sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The hand remains in a similar position throughout.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the presence of the walkie-talkie, it focuses too heavily on technical camera movements rather than the subject's actions, which violates the core instruction to describe the subject's motion. Phrases like \"the camera adopts a first-person perspective\" and \"trucking to the right\" are overly clinical and indirect. A more effective description would state the subject's action directly, for example, \"A person walks forward at a brisk pace,\" which would also naturally explain the \"noticeable shaking.\" Furthermore, the caption only mentions that the walkie-talkie is being held. If the video shows the person interacting with it—for instance, pressing a button with their thumb to speak—this crucial interaction with an object is completely missed. The description should focus on what the person is *doing* (walking, turning, pressing a button) rather than how the camera is recording it, using simpler, more natural language to describe the movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person holds a yellow walkie-talkie in their hand, which remains steady in the lower-left corner of the frame. As they walk forward briskly, the video captures noticeable shaking. The person occasionally presses a button on the walkie-talkie with their thumb, indicating they are speaking into it.",
