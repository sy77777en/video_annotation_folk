    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This abstract video showcases a cascade of luminous blue elements against a dark background. From a bright, cyan-colored glow at the top of the scene, numerous thin, vertical streaks of blue light move in various directions. Scattered throughout the space are countless small, sparkling particles of light, also blue, that either float independently or are attached to the middle of the vertical streaks, creating a sense of depth and a dynamic, shimmering effect.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the two primary visual elements—the blue streaks and the sparkling particles—but the description of their motion lacks specificity and chronological detail. The phrase \"move and float in various directions irregularly\" is too general. For instance, if the video shows the thin, vertical streaks consistently falling from the top of the frame while the smaller particles simultaneously drift upwards and outwards from the bottom, this distinct opposing motion is a key detail that is missed. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe any potential interaction or causal relationship between the elements. If the streaks fall and then burst into the sparkling particles as they fade, this chronological sequence is a crucial aspect of the motion that should be included. Finally, the concluding phrase \"creating a dynamic effect of cascading light\" is an abstract interpretation of the aesthetic rather than a direct description of the observable movement. A more precise caption would describe the specific paths and any interactions, such as the streaks falling downwards before dissolving into particles that then float upwards.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Thin, vertical streaks of blue light consistently fall from the bright light source at the top of the screen, descending in straight lines. As these streaks reach a certain point, they burst into smaller, sparkling particles that drift upwards and outwards from the bottom, creating a distinct opposing motion. This interaction between the elements forms a dynamic sequence where the streaks transform into particles, adding layers of movement against the dark background.",
