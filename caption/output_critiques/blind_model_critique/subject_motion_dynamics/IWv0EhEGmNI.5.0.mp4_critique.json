    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective, a person wearing tactical gloves holds a black assault rifle equipped with a holographic sight. The scene is viewed through a green-tinted night vision filter, which includes a digital heads-up display showing an ammunition count of 7/82 and other on-screen graphics. The setting is a dark, indoor area containing what appears to be an empty, tiled swimming pool with metal handrails. A large, white, classical-style pillar stands near a potted plant. A man with a gun is seen walking up from the pool.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the chronological sequence of events, but it lacks specificity regarding the nature of the subjects' movements. The description \"walks slowly and cautiously\" is too general; the video likely shows the camera holder moving in a tactical manner, perhaps with a weapon held in a low-ready position, methodically scanning the environment. The caption also misses this key detail that the first-person subject is armed, which is critical context given the other individual is described as such. Furthermore, the phrase \"walking up from the pool area\" is ambiguous. A more precise description would clarify how this person emerges—for instance, \"ascends the concrete steps from the deep end of the empty pool\" or \"walks up the sloped floor of the pool basin.\" Finally, the caption describes two separate actions but fails to capture any interaction between the two armed individuals, such as one providing cover for the other or an exchange of hand signals, which would be a central element of their coordinated movement.",
