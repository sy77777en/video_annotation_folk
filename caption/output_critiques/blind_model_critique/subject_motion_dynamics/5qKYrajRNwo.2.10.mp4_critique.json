    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room with a background of circular patterns on the wall, a young girl with braided hair and wearing a dark blue dress with a white undershirt is seen interacting with a box. She lifts the box slightly and begins to open it, using both hands to lift the lid. The girl continues to open the box, revealing its contents as she looks inside.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young girl with light skin and long, dark braided hair. She is wearing a dark blue dress with short sleeves. The girl is interacting with a large, dark-colored box, which she is opening and peering into. Her posture is leaning forward, as she opens the latch and lifts the top part of the box, indicating curiosity or intent focus. The box appears to be made of a sturdy material. The setting suggests an intimate, possibly personal space, as indicated by the girl's close engagement with the box.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily the one requiring a focus on motion over static details.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is factually accurate. It describes a girl opening a box.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption describes a single, continuous sequence of actions from start to finish (lifting, opening, looking). It appears to be a complete description of the primary motion in the video.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Focus on Motion (Major Failure):** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption violates this rule significantly. The entire first sentence is dedicated to static details:\n    *   **Setting:** \"In a dimly lit room with a background of circular patterns on the wall...\"\n    *   **Subject Appearance:** \"...a young girl with braided hair and wearing a dark blue dress with a white undershirt...\"\n    These details do not describe motion and should have been omitted.\n\n*   **Conciseness (Needs Improvement):** The caption is not as concise as it could be.\n    *   The phrase \"is seen interacting with a box\" is passive and redundant, as the subsequent sentences describe the specific interaction.\n    *   The sequence \"begins to open it... continues to open the box\" could be streamlined into a more direct description.\n\n*   **Chronological Order (Good):** The caption successfully presents the actions in the correct chronological order: 1) lifts the box, 2) begins opening it with both hands, 3) continues opening, and 4) looks inside.\n\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity (Good):** The language used is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language as instructed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption fails because it prioritizes scene-setting and appearance over the primary instruction to describe **motion**. It reads more like a general video description than the specific, motion-focused paragraph requested.\n\nA better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\n**A girl lifts a box slightly, uses both hands to raise the lid, and then looks down into the opened container.**",
