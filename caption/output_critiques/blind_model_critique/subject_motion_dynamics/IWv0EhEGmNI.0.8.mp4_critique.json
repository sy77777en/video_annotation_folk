    "pre_caption": "The man sits still in profile, facing to the right, with his head slightly tilted downward. He does not make any noticeable movements throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with light skin, a full beard, and a mustache, wearing a dark cap. He appears to be middle-aged and is shown in profile, facing to the right. His expression is neutral and focused, and his head is slightly tilted downward. The lighting highlights the contours of his face, emphasizing his facial hair and the brim of his cap. The man remains the central subject throughout the video, with no other human subjects visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies that the subject is a man, describes his static posture (sitting in profile, facing right, head tilted down), and confirms the complete lack of motion.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. For a video with no subject motion, it fulfills the core requirement by clearly stating this. It provides the necessary context of the subject's static pose without adding unnecessary details about his appearance.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly follows the specific instruction for a subject with no movement by briefly mentioning the lack of motion.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is concise, clear, and written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional adjectives, speculative language (\"appears to be,\" \"might be\"), and abstract descriptions.\n*   **Chronological Order:** Not applicable due to the lack of movement, but it correctly describes a continuous state.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, unformatted paragraph without any introductory text.\n*   **Specificity:** It is specific in describing the static pose (\"sits still in profile, facing to the right\") which is essential context for the lack of movement.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It perfectly interprets and applies the instructions, especially the specific rule for handling a video with a static subject. It is a model example of how to describe a lack of motion clearly and concisely while adhering to all the given constraints.",
