    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with a medium skin tone, dark hair, and a full dark beard and mustache is shown. He is wearing a black hooded winter jacket with the hood pulled up over his head. Strapped to his chest is a light blue bag. An orange strap-like decoration is visible near his right shoulder. He stands while occasionally looking slightly to the right of the frame and speaking.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively meets the requirements of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the subject's actions. It correctly identifies that the man is standing, holding a camera, speaking, and turning his head.\n*   **Completeness:** It captures all the essential movements in the video. It establishes the subject's initial state (standing, holding, speaking) and then describes the subsequent, distinct motion (turning his head).\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence: he is standing and speaking, *then* he turns his head.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption focuses on what the man *does* (\"stands,\" \"holding,\" \"speaking,\" \"turns his head\") rather than just his appearance.\n    *   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objective and Factual:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. It describes only what is visibly happening.\n    *   **Specific Actions:** It uses clear action verbs like \"speaking\" and \"turns his head,\" which are more specific than generic descriptions.\n    *   **Object Interaction:** It correctly notes the static interaction of \"holding a camera.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality description that is accurate, concise, and follows all the provided guidelines.",
