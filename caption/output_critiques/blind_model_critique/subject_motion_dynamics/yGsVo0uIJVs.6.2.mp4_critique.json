    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large ship with a dark hull and white superstructures sailing on the ocean. The ship has a prominent yellow lattice tower at its center, which is likely used for drilling or similar operations. The deck is equipped with various equipment and structures, including containers. The ship is moving steadily through the water, with the waves gently lapping against its hull.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large, industrial ship navigating through the ocean. The ship is characterized by its dark hull with a red waterline and a series of white superstructures on deck. A prominent feature is the tall, yellow lattice tower positioned centrally, likely used for drilling or similar operations. The ship's deck is equipped with various equipment and structures, including containers, indicating its utilitarian purpose. The vessel is oriented with its bow facing forward, cutting through the waves, suggesting movement and purpose.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your feedback is as follows:\n\nThe provided caption focuses excessively on the ship's static appearance, describing its \"dark hull,\" \"white superstructures,\" and \"yellow lattice tower,\" which violates the instruction to prioritize motion. The description of movement is too generic, using the phrase \"moving steadily\" without providing specific details. A more effective caption would describe the ship's trajectory and its interaction with the environment, for example, by stating that the ship moves from left to right across the frame, cutting through the water and leaving a prominent white wake trailing from its stern. Furthermore, the caption includes the speculative phrase \"which is likely used for drilling,\" which is explicitly forbidden. The description should be revised to eliminate static details and speculation, focusing instead on observable actions like the ship plowing through the waves and the specific path it takes through the water.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a large ship cutting through the ocean, moving from left to right across the frame. Its dark hull slices through the water, leaving a prominent white wake trailing from its stern.
