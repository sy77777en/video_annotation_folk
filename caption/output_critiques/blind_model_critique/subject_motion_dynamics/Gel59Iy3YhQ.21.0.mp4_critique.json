    "pre_caption": "A character with long pink hair is sitting on the edge of a cliff, facing away from the camera and looking out at a vibrant, cloud-filled sky with a setting sun. The character's hair is gently blowing in the wind, and the sky is filled with small, glowing particles that move across the scene. The background transitions from a darker, starry sky to a brighter, more colorful sky as the sun sets, casting a warm glow over the clouds.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features an animated character with long pink hair sitting on the ground. The character is dressed in dark-colored clothing and is facing away, gazing towards a colorful, cloud-filled sky. The character's posture is relaxed, with arms wrapped around its knees. The scene conveys a sense of contemplation or observation.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is moderately effective but has several areas where it fails to adhere to the specific instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible animated scene. It correctly identifies a character, their static position, and the motion of environmental elements like hair, particles, and the sky.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in that it covers all the visible activity in the video: the character's static state, the movement of their hair, the movement of particles, and the transition of the background sky.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has significant weaknesses.\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption begins with a long, static description of the character sitting on a cliff before mentioning any movement. The primary focus is on the scene's composition, not the motion within it.\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule multiple times with words like \"**vibrant**,\" \"**gently**,\" \"**brighter**,\" \"**more colorful**,\" and \"**warm**.\"\n*   **Chronological Order:** While the subject's main action is static (sitting), the caption does correctly describe the background's change in a chronological way (\"transitions from a darker... to a brighter... sky\"). However, it mixes descriptions of continuous motion (hair blowing, particles moving) with this one-time transition. A better structure would be to state the character's static position and then describe the continuous environmental movements.\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is not as concise as it could be because it dedicates significant space to describing the static scene rather than prioritizing the description of movement.\n\n**In summary,** while the caption accurately describes the video's content, it fails to follow key negative constraints, particularly the avoidance of subjective language and the primary focus on motion. A better caption would have briefly noted the character's static position and then described the environmental motion using neutral, objective language.",
