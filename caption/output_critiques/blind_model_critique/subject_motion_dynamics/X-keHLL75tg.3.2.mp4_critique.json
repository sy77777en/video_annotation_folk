    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a light-skinned man with long, dark brown hair and a small earring in his left ear, wearing a white polo shirt. He is initially seen in profile speaking to another man before turning to face the camera with a wide, toothy smile. To his left stands another light-skinned man with short, dark, curly hair and a mustache, dressed in a black short-sleeved shirt, maintaining a serious expression while looking at the first man. Positioned between them is a brown horse wearing a bridle, facing forward in a stable aisle. A third individual, dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt, has his hand raised near the horse's head.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and their primary actions in chronological order, it could be improved by clarifying their spatial relationships and refining the description of their movements. The phrase \"the horse positioned between them\" is ambiguous, as it's unclear if the horse is between the two men or if the man in black and the horse are a unit. A more precise description of the scene's layout, such as \"A man in a black shirt stands beside a horse,\" would provide better context. Furthermore, describing the continuous action of combing the horse's hair before or after the main, discrete action of the other man turning to smile might create a more logical flow. The term \"tuft of hair\" could be replaced with the more specific \"forelock.\" Finally, the description of the third person could be more accurate; if only their hand is visible, the caption should state \"a hand holding a comb\" rather than implying a fully visible person.",
