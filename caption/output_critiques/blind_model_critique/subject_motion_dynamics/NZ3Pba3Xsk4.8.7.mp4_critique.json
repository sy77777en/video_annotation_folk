    "pre_caption": "Several deer move around within an enclosed area; one deer on the left walks toward the shelter, another deer near the center stands still and looks forward, while a third deer on the right side of the enclosure walks slowly toward the back. Other deer in the background also walk or stand near the shelter and trees, with their movements generally limited to walking or standing within the enclosure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies and separates the actions of multiple deer in chronological order, but it could be more specific and descriptive. The phrase \"jumps up\" is generic; a more precise verb like \"leaps\" or \"pronks\" would better describe the deer's specific motion. The description of the deer eating \"something\" inside the shelter is vague; specifying that it eats from a visible trough or a pile of hay would add valuable detail. Similarly, the background deer that \"moves to the left\" could be described more vividly, for example, as \"ambling from right to left behind the shelter.\" The overall structure feels slightly fragmented, listing actions for each deer separately. A more integrated paragraph could better convey the sense of a single, cohesive scene, perhaps by describing the general, calm movements of the background deer before focusing on the more distinct actions of the deer in the foreground.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In an enclosed area, several deer move about in a calm and serene manner. In the foreground, a deer on the left gracefully walks toward a shelter, where it begins to eat from a visible trough. Near the center, another deer stands still, gazing forward with a watchful eye. On the right side of the enclosure, a third deer slowly ambles toward the back, its movements deliberate and unhurried. In the background, other deer amble from right to left behind the shelter, their movements gentle and unassuming as they navigate around the trees and shelter, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere of the scene.",
