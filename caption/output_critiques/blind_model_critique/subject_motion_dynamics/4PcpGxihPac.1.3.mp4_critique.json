    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a person, whose gender is not discernible, centered in a dark, wooded environment saturated with intense red light. This individual has a pale face and is positioned among tree trunks and branches, aiming a gun forward. A bright red horizontal lens flare crosses the middle of the scene. Throughout the shot, the camera slowly zooms in, making the person's head the primary focus and appear larger in the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to a key instruction.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the scene's content: a stationary person with a gun in a wooded area, and a camera zoom.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption correctly identifies the primary state of the subject, which is being stationary. It captures the most important aspect of the subject's (lack of) motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows several instructions. It is concise, uses simple and natural English, avoids emotional or subjective adjectives, and refrains from speculative language. It correctly identifies the static interaction (\"holding a gun\").\n\n*   **Weaknesses:** The caption violates one of the most critical instructions: **\"Focus on the subject's motion.\"**\n    *   The second sentence, \"The camera slowly zooms in, causing the person's head to become more prominent in the frame,\" describes the movement of the camera, not the subject. The instructions explicitly state to describe the subject's actions and avoid details not related to their movement.\n    *   For a static subject, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" By describing the camera's action and its effect on the framing, the caption adds unnecessary detail that is not about the subject's motion.\n\n### A Better Caption Example:\n\nA person holding a gun stands stationary in a wooded area.",
