    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a close-up of a Black woman with long black braids, some of which are adorned with red and yellow beads, and a yellow butterfly clip in her hair. She is draped in an American flag, revealing a blue and white striped top and a silver necklace with a circular pendant underneath. She smiles as she speaks into a black microphone. The shot then pulls back to reveal two other Black women standing to the right of the original woman, positioned on the left side of the frame. The woman in the middle has her dark hair pulled back, is also draped in an American flag over a blue top, and is laughing while holding a water bottle. The woman on the far right wears a white headband in her dark hair and is draped in an American flag over a blue top with the name \"TERRY\" in white letters. All three women are smiling. A hand holding a black microphone with the NBC logo alongside the word \"Sports\" is extended towards them from the right side of the frame, indicating they are being interviewed as a group.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly establishes the chronological sequence of events, starting with a single woman and revealing two more through a camera zoom. However, the description of their interaction with the microphone is vague and speculative. The phrase \"appear to take turns speaking\" violates the instruction to avoid ambiguity and should be replaced with a concrete description of the action. For instance, if the first woman physically hands the microphone to the second, the caption should state, \"The first woman passes the microphone to the woman beside her, who then speaks.\" Furthermore, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the motion of the non-speaking women; it only mentions they are smiling. A more complete description would include if they are nodding in agreement, looking at the speaker, or gesturing, which are all important parts of their movement and interaction within the group. The description of the camera movement as a \"zoom out\" is accurate but could be more specific, such as \"the camera slowly pulls back,\" to better convey the motion's quality.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a woman speaking and smiling. The camera slowly pulls back as a second woman enters the frame from the right, laughing. The shot settles on the three women standing together, all smiling. The first woman passes the microphone to the woman beside her, who then speaks. While she talks, the other two women nod in agreement and occasionally glance at each other, enhancing their interaction within the group.",
