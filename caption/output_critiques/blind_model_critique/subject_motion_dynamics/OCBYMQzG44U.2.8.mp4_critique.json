  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the first-person perspective and the basic camera movement, but it violates several key instructions by focusing heavily on static, atmospheric descriptions rather than the specifics of the motion. The use of subjective and interpretive language such as \"dynamic,\" \"sterile,\" and \"minimalist atmosphere\" is explicitly forbidden. The description of the motion itself, \"pans rightward around the corner,\" is too generic. For instance, I imagine the camera movement is not just a simple pan but a slow, deliberate glide that contributes to the scene's tension or tranquility; this crucial detail about the quality and speed of the motion is missing. A better caption would begin by describing the specific nature of the camera's movement in chronological order—for example, \"From a first-person perspective, the camera glides slowly and steadily to the right\"—and then concisely state what this motion reveals—\"rounding a corner to show a large, empty, tiled room lit by overhead lights and a glowing vertical line on the far wall\"—thus prioritizing the action over subjective environmental analysis.",
