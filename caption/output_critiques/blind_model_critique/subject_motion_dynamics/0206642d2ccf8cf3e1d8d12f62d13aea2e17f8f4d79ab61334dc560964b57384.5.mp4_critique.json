    "pre_caption": "A wooden cutting board is shown with a pile of chopped cucumbers, a large knife with a white handle, and some green onions, tomatoes, and lettuce placed in front of the board.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene and the person's movement is likely accurate based on the text.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption describes the only motion present in the scene (the person moving). In that sense, it is complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Failure - Focus on Motion:** The most significant failure is that the caption violates the core instruction: \"**Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.**\" The entire first sentence is a detailed list of static objects (cutting board, cucumbers, knife, onions, tomatoes, lettuce), which is explicitly what the instructions say to avoid.\n*   **Failure - Conciseness:** Because the caption spends so much time on static details, it is not concise. The first sentence could be removed entirely to better follow the instructions. The final clause, \"...leaving the chopped cucumbers and the vegetables on the cutting board,\" is also redundant, as the objects were already described as stationary.\n*   **Partial Success - Chronological Order:** The description of the person's movement is chronological (\"moves from the left side... to the right,\" then \"continues to move out of the frame\"). This part is done correctly.\n*   **Success - Simple and Objective Language:** The caption uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language, which aligns with the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is poor because it dedicates more than half of its length to describing static objects, directly contradicting the main directive to focus only on motion. A good caption would have omitted the detailed list of vegetables and the cutting board and focused exclusively on the person's movement.",
