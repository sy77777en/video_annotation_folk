    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures an open-air football stadium during a game, with the stands densely packed with spectators, many of whom are wearing purple and yellow attire. The green football field is marked with white yard lines, a large \"N\" logo at midfield, and \"BIG\" logos. Players in white uniforms with purple numbers and helmets are visible on the field, engaged in gameplay. Two tall light towers with bright lights illuminate the stadium under an overcast sky. As the camera pans to the right, the building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" becomes visible, along with several spectators in the foreground at the right corner of the scene. One individual, seen from the back, has light brown hair and wears a red visor. Next to this person, a man with light skin is shown in profile, looking towards the field; he wears a dark green baseball cap and a grey long-sleeved top. Partially visible behind him is a woman with blonde hair, and another spectator wearing a purple hat is seen in the lower right. The pan also reveals more of the field, including a purple end zone with \"WILDCATS\" written in white and a goalpost. Many other people are visible in the row.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to follow the core instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its flaws:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is factually accurate. It correctly describes a camera panning right across a football stadium, revealing players, a goalpost, a building, and spectators.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is reasonably complete in describing the visual elements that appear during the pan. However, it only describes the players as \"standing,\" which may be an incomplete description of their motion if they are performing any subtle actions.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** This is where the caption fails significantly.\n    *   **Incorrect Focus:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" This caption's main subject is the camera (\"The camera pans slowly to the right...\"). The instructions are about describing the actions of people, animals, or objects *within* the video, not the cinematography or camera work.\n    *   **Violation of Core Principle:** The instructions explicitly ask to describe the *subject's* motion. By focusing on the camera's movement, the caption fundamentally misunderstands its purpose. The players and spectators are treated as static parts of the scenery being revealed by the pan, rather than as the primary subjects whose actions should be described.\n    *   **Lack of Action Description:** The caption describes the players' state (\"standing\") rather than an action. While this is correct if they are motionless, the main descriptive energy is spent on the pan itself, which is contrary to the guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Players on the field are engaged in a pre-game warm-up, stretching and jogging in place. In the right end zone, a kicker practices field goals, sending the ball soaring through the goalpost. Spectators in the foreground cheer and wave, adding to the lively atmosphere of the crowded stadium.",
