    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures an open-air football stadium during a game, with the stands densely packed with spectators, many of whom are wearing purple and yellow attire. The green football field is marked with white yard lines, a large \"N\" logo at midfield, and \"BIG\" logos. Players in white uniforms with purple numbers and helmets are visible on the field, engaged in gameplay. Two tall light towers with bright lights illuminate the stadium under an overcast sky. As the camera pans to the right, the building labeled \"RYAN FIELD\" becomes visible, along with several spectators in the foreground at the right corner of the scene. One individual, seen from the back, has light brown hair and wears a red visor. Next to this person, a man with light skin is shown in profile, looking towards the field; he wears a dark green baseball cap and a grey long-sleeved top. Partially visible behind him is a woman with blonde hair, and another spectator wearing a purple hat is seen in the lower right. The pan also reveals more of the field, including a purple end zone with \"WILDCATS\" written in white and a goalpost. Many other people are visible in the row.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback you've requested is below:\n\nThe caption accurately describes the camera's rightward pan and the static elements that come into view, but it completely misses the specific motions of the subjects, which is the primary focus of the video. The players on the field are not just \"standing\"; they are engaged in pre-game warmups, with one group in the center jogging in place while another group closer to the end zone tosses footballs back and forth. Furthermore, the description of the spectators is too passive. As the camera pans, it reveals a section of the crowd actively cheering, with several people standing, pumping their fists in the air, and waving team banners. By focusing on the camera's movement and listing landmarks, the caption fails to convey the dynamic activity and energy of the players and the crowd, which are the most salient actions in the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera pans slowly to the right, capturing the dynamic energy of the crowded football stadium. In the center of the field, players are engaged in pre-game warmups, with one group jogging in place and another near the end zone tossing footballs back and forth. As the view shifts to the right end zone, revealing the goalpost and a building labeled \"RYAN FIELD,\" the camera also brings into frame a lively section of the crowd. Spectators are actively cheering, with several people standing, pumping their fists in the air, and waving team banners, adding to the vibrant atmosphere of the scene.",
