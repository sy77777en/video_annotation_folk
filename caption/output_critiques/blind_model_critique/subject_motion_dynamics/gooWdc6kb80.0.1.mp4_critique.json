    "pre_caption": "A man holds a cookie over a red cup of milk and then releases it. As the cookie falls, he picks up a smartphone from the table and aims it at the cup. In slow motion, the cookie plunges into the milk, sending a crown-shaped splash of liquid upwards. The man holds the phone steady, pointing it at the splash.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses sits at a wooden table. He wears a grey t-shirt with a leaf pattern. In front of him, a red ceramic cup filled with white milk rests on a white saucer, next to a black smartphone. The man holds a chocolate chip cookie over the cup, drops it into the milk, and then picks up his phone to photograph the resulting splash. The video captures the cookie falling and the milk splashing upwards in a crown shape in slow motion.**",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is that the chronological order of the actions seems implausible and inefficient for the described outcome. The caption states the man picks up the smartphone *as* the cookie is falling, which is a very brief window of time to grab a phone, unlock it, open the camera, and aim it accurately to capture the splash. It is more likely that the video shows the man already holding the phone and aiming it with one hand while he uses the other to drop the cookie. The current description makes the successful slow-motion capture seem accidental rather than intentional. A more accurate caption would likely describe the man first aiming the phone at the cup and then, while continuing to film, releasing the cookie. While the description of the slow-motion splash is excellent and specific, the setup described in the first half of the caption does not logically lead to that well-captured moment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man holds a cookie over a red cup of milk, aiming a smartphone at the cup with his other hand. As he releases the cookie, he continues to film, capturing the moment in slow motion. The cookie plunges into the milk, sending a crown-shaped splash of liquid upwards, while the man holds the phone steady, perfectly capturing the splash.",
