    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The primary focus of the video is a light-skinned woman with long, wavy blonde hair, who is wearing a white knit beanie, a black tank top, and a bright blue zip-up hoodie. She is standing and speaking to a light-skinned man with short brown hair, a short beard, and a tattoo on his left forearm. This man is dressed in a vibrant yellow and green long-sleeved motocross jersey and has goggles resting on the back of his head. Positioned behind the main subjects are three other people observing the interaction: a man wearing a black t-shirt, sunglasses, and a backward baseball cap while holding a pole, and two women standing further back.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and the general context of a conversation, but it oversimplifies their movements and misses the dynamic nature of the interaction. The description of the woman's motion as \"slight movements of her head\" is too vague; in the video, she actively gestures with her right hand to emphasize her points and shifts her weight from one foot to the other as she speaks. Stating the man \"stands still\" is inaccurate, as he periodically nods in acknowledgment and at one point crosses his arms, a significant non-verbal cue that the caption omits. The caption also fails to describe the chronological back-and-forth of the conversation, such as the man briefly uncrossing his arms to respond after the woman pauses. Furthermore, the background individuals are not all \"observing\"; one person is looking down at their phone, while the other two are turned slightly away, engaged in their own quiet conversation, making their connection to the main subjects less direct than implied.",
