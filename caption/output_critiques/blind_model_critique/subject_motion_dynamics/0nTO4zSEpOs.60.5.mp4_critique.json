    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape at night, featuring tall buildings with illuminated signs and advertisements. A man in a suit, holding a phone and a bag, walks towards the camera, passing by other pedestrians. The camera continues to move forward, capturing more of the city's vibrant nightlife, including a woman in a coat and yellow shoes walking in the opposite direction. As the camera progresses, it focuses on the busy street below, where numerous buses and cars are seen moving. The video concludes with a broader view of the bustling street, emphasizing the dynamic and lively urban environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures a bustling urban scene at night, featuring a modern cityscape with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. In the foreground, pedestrians are visible on a walkway. The background showcases a busy street with several buses and cars, highlighting the vibrant city life. The overall atmosphere is lively, with the bright lights of the buildings contrasting against the night sky.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is moderately good but has several significant flaws in its adherence to the specific instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to accurately describe a plausible sequence of events in a video of a city at night. It correctly identifies subjects (a man, a woman, vehicles) and their general movements in a chronological order.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a start-to-finish overview of the video, mentioning the initial establishing shot, the movement of pedestrians, and the final focus on street traffic. It successfully captures the main elements of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, sequential order, from the initial view to the man walking, the woman walking, and the final focus on traffic.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is written as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Simple English:** The language used is clear and easy to understand.\n*   **Individual Actions:** It describes the man's and woman's individual actions with some clarity (e.g., \"walks towards the camera,\" \"walking in the opposite direction\").\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n*   **Use of Subjective and Emotional Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using words like \"vibrant,\" \"busy,\" \"bustling,\" \"dynamic,\" and \"lively.\" These words interpret the scene rather than objectively describing it.\n*   **Use of Abstract Descriptions:** The final clause, \"emphasizing the dynamic and lively urban environment,\" is a direct violation of the instruction to \"Avoid abstract descriptions, such as 'emphasizing its speed and agility'.\" It describes the intended feeling or effect of the shot, not the literal motion occurring within it.\n*   **Generic Motion Description:** The description of the traffic—\"where numerous buses and cars are seen moving\"—is too generic. The instructions ask for specificity, similar to describing a \"flock of geese flies in a V-formation\" instead of \"birds are flying.\" A better description would be more specific, such as \"vehicles travel in multiple lanes down the street.\"\n*   **Focus on Scenery Instead of Motion:** The caption spends time describing the static scene (\"a view of a cityscape at night, featuring tall buildings with illuminated signs\") and the overall impression (\"broader view of the bustling street\") rather than strictly focusing on the motion of the subjects, which is the primary directive.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the subjects and their chronological actions, it fails to adhere to the critical negative constraints of avoiding subjective, abstract, and interpretive language. It also misses an opportunity to describe the group motion of the vehicles with greater specificity.",
