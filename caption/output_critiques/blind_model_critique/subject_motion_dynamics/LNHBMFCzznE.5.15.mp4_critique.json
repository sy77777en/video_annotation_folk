    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a woman with fair skin and brown, shoulder-length hair, who is standing on a stage and speaking. She is wearing a sleeveless black dress that ends just above her knees and black knee-high boots. She holds a microphone in her right hand and gestures with her left as she addresses an audience. The stage she stands on is elevated and covered with a square red carpet. In the foreground, seated in the dark, is the audience, visible primarily as silhouettes illuminated by the blue light from the stage. They are positioned below the stage and are watching the woman speak.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The description of the woman's motion is too general and static. While it correctly identifies that she \"raises and gestures with her left hand,\" it lacks specificity. For instance, the video might show her emphatically chopping the air with her hand for one point, then using an open palm to welcome a question, or pointing towards a large screen behind her that displays presentation slides—details the current caption omits. Furthermore, the caption states she \"stands,\" which implies she is stationary, but in the video, she could be pacing back and forth across the stage to engage different sections of the audience. The description of the audience as \"still\" is also a potential oversimplification; the video might show them applauding at the beginning or end, or a few individuals shifting in their seats, which are subtle but observable motions. Lastly, the caption assumes a single, continuous shot, whereas the video could employ cuts, such as a zoom-in on her face as she makes a key point, or a cut to a wide shot showing the scale of the audience, which would be important transitions to describe.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman paces back and forth on a red carpet on an elevated stage, holding a microphone in her right hand. As she speaks, she emphatically chops the air with her left hand to emphasize a point, then uses an open palm to welcome questions, and occasionally points towards a large screen behind her displaying presentation slides. The audience, initially visible as silhouettes, applauds at the beginning and end, with some individuals shifting in their seats. The video includes dynamic cuts, zooming in on her face as she makes key points and transitioning to wide shots that reveal the scale of the audience.",
