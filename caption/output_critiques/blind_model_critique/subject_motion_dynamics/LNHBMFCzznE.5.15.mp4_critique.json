    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a woman with fair skin and brown, shoulder-length hair, who is standing on a stage and speaking. She is wearing a sleeveless black dress that ends just above her knees and black knee-high boots. She holds a microphone in her right hand and gestures with her left as she addresses an audience. The stage she stands on is elevated and covered with a square red carpet. In the foreground, seated in the dark, is the audience, visible primarily as silhouettes illuminated by the blue light from the stage. They are positioned below the stage and are watching the woman speak.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly aligns with all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a plausible and clear scene, identifying the main subject (a woman), secondary subjects (the audience), key objects (microphone), and the setting (elevated stage, red carpet). The actions described are precise and factual.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete for a scene of this nature. It successfully captures:\n*   **Setting:** \"on a red carpet on an elevated stage\"\n*   **Main Subject's State & Action:** \"stands... holding a microphone... raises and gestures with her left hand.\"\n*   **Secondary Subjects' State & Action:** \"The audience... remains seated and still, watching her presentation.\"\n*   **Interaction:** The relationship between the speaker and the audience (\"watching her presentation\") is clearly established.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full picture of the scene in a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly establishes the subject's static position (\"stands\") before describing the subsequent motion (\"raises and gestures\").\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It excels here by describing the specific motion (\"raises and gestures with her left hand\") rather than just saying \"she moves her hand.\" It also correctly describes the *lack* of motion in the audience (\"remains seated and still\").\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"passionately,\" \"it seems like\").\n*   **Specificity:**\n    *   **Individual Action:** \"raises and gestures with her left hand\" is a specific description of an individual's action.\n    *   **Object Interaction:** \"holding a microphone in her right hand\" clearly specifies the interaction with an object.\n    *   **Group Activity:** \"The audience... remains seated and still, watching her presentation\" is a specific and effective description of the group's collective behavior.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the main subject (the woman) while concisely describing the secondary subjects (the audience).\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and focuses precisely on the subjects' motion and interactions in a clear, chronological manner.",
