    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **An older, white-haired man with light skin is on the left, smiling broadly. He wears a black suit jacket over a light-colored collared shirt. A text overlay identifies him as \"Richard H. Thaler, PhD.\" To his right, a young woman with long, dark brown hair and tan skin also smiles. She is wearing a black top, and a text overlay identifies her as \"Selena Gomez.\" In the blurred background between them, another woman in a leopard-print top holds a glass.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **good**, but it could be more concise and focused on motion.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible scene: two people of different ages and genders interacting in a crowded space. It correctly identifies their positions (\"on the left,\" \"on the right\"), their expressions (\"smiling\"), their interaction (\"looking toward each other\"), and the specific type of movement (\"heads move slightly\").\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The description is complete. It captures the main subjects, their minimal motion, their interaction with each other, and the context of the environment (\"crowded environment\") without adding unecessary details. It successfully conveys that the video is mostly static.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Clarity and Objectivity:** The caption uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"happy,\" \"appears to be\"). \"Smiling\" is an observable action, which is acceptable.\n    *   **Focus on Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction between the two subjects (\"stand close together,\" \"looking toward each other,\" \"interact\").\n    *   **Handling Minimal Motion:** It correctly follows the instruction for videos with little movement by noting the scene is \"largely stationary\" and describing the \"subtle head movements.\"\n    *   **Proper Use of Appearance:** It uses \"older man\" and \"younger woman\" to differentiate the subjects, which is consistent with the instructions.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Redundancy and Conciseness:** The caption is slightly repetitive. The first sentence establishes that they are standing, and the second describes their head movements. The third sentence (\"The scene remains largely stationary, with the primary motion being the subtle head movements...\") largely repeats this information. The entire description could be condensed into a single, more efficient sentence.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The instruction emphasizes focusing on motion from the start. The caption begins by describing a static state (\"stand close together, both smiling\"). While logical, it could be rephrased to lead with the action, however subtle it may be.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nFor comparison, here is a revised version that is more concise and adheres more strictly to the instructions:\n\n\"In a crowded environment, an older man and a younger woman stand close together, smiling and looking at each other as their heads move slightly.\"",
