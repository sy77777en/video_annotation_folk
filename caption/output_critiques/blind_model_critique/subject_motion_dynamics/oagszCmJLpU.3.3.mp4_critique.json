  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject as a time-lapse of a supercell storm system and notes its general movement. However, it could be more specific about the nature of this motion. For instance, instead of just \"swirling,\" the caption could describe the distinct rotation of the central mesocyclone, which is the defining characteristic of a supercell, perhaps specifying if it spins clockwise or counter-clockwise. The description of the storm \"advancing rapidly\" is accurate for a time-lapse, but it lacks directional detail, such as moving from the background toward the foreground or from left to right across the frame. Additionally, the caption misses other potential key motions, such as the frequent flashes of lightning that would likely be visible illuminating the cloud mass from within, or the movement of smaller, lower clouds being pulled into the main rotating updraft. The phrasing is also slightly redundant, repeating \"massive storm clouds\" after establishing it's a \"massive storm system.\" A more effective caption would integrate these specific actions into a single, concise flow, such as describing the central cloud mass rotating as the entire system advances across the plain, periodically lit by internal lightning.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video captures a supercell storm system with a distinct counter-clockwise rotation of the central mesocyclone, moving from the background toward the foreground over a vast, flat, grassy plain. The scene is periodically illuminated by flashes of lightning from within the swirling cloud mass, while smaller, lower clouds are drawn into the main rotating updraft.",
