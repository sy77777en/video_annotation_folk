    "pre_caption": "The video displays a static shot of a large pumpkin and a baseball cap on a wooden surface, with no movement from the subjects or the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays a very large, round, yellow-orange pumpkin resting on a wooden surface. The pumpkin has prominent vertical ridges along its surface. Next to the pumpkin's stem sits a dark green baseball cap with a circular orange and white logo on the front. The scene focuses on the gradual enlargement of the pumpkin.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the two main actions in chronological and concurrent order but lacks specificity regarding the nature of the motion and the interaction between the subjects. The phrase \"gradually increasing in size\" is ambiguous; if the video is a stop-motion animation, a more accurate description would be that the pumpkin expands in a series of small, distinct increments. Similarly, \"shifting position slightly\" for the baseball cap is too general. A more detailed account would describe *how* it shifts—for instance, if it slides smoothly or jerks away in sync with the pumpkin's growth spurts. The caption also misses the opportunity to explicitly state the cause-and-effect relationship; it describes two parallel events rather than clarifying that the pumpkin's expansion is what pushes the baseball cap away, causing it to move. A better description would link these actions, for example, by stating that the pumpkin expands outwards, pushing the baseball cap and causing it to slide and tilt on the wooden surface.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a stop-motion animation where a large pumpkin gradually expands in a series of small, distinct increments on a wooden surface. As the pumpkin grows, it pushes a nearby baseball cap, causing the cap to slide smoothly and tilt slightly away in sync with the pumpkin's growth.",
