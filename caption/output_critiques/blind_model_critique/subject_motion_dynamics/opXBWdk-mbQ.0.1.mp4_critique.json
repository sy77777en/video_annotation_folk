    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Three men are sitting in a row at a long white counter, eating lunch. The man in the middle ground, who is the most in focus, is a light-skinned man in his late 20s or early 30s with short, neat brown hair. He is wearing a maroon polo shirt and is seen in profile, eating a salad from a clear plastic container with a fork. To his left, the right side of the framet, slightly out of focus, are two additional light-skinned men in their 30s. One is wearing a dark green t-shirt and is taking food out of a brown paper bag, while the other is wearing a white collared shirt. Both of these men turn their heads to look at the man in the middle ground.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological overview, but it could be more precise about the timing and causal relationships between the subjects' actions. For instance, it's unclear if the second and third men turn their heads *in reaction* to the first man looking up, or if the movements are merely coincidental. The description of the first man's motion, \"looks up and straight ahead,\" is also general; specifying whether this is a sudden, alert movement or a slow, casual gaze would add significant context. Furthermore, the phrase \"look in the same direction\" for the third man is ambiguous—it's not clear if he is looking *at* the first man or looking *past* him at whatever caught the first man's attention. Finally, the action sequence for the main subject feels incomplete; mentioning whether he lowers his fork back to the container or holds it in the air after taking a bite would provide a more thorough description of the object interaction.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man in the foreground lifts a forkful of salad from a container to his mouth, eats it, and then suddenly looks up and to his right with an alert expression. As he does so, the man next to him, who is reaching into a brown paper bag, turns his head to look directly at the first man, seemingly in reaction to his movement. Meanwhile, the third man in the background also turns his head slightly, appearing to look past the first man, possibly at whatever caught his attention. After taking the bite, the first man holds his fork in the air, rather than lowering it back to the container.",
