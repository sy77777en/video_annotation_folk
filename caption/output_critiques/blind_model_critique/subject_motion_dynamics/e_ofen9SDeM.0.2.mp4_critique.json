    "pre_caption": "An elderly man walks up a grassy hill, moving towards the camera. As he ascends, his full torso comes into view, revealing that he is carrying two large cloth sacks, one in each hand. The camera then focuses on his lower body as he continues to walk up the hill, carrying the sacks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **An elderly man with long, wispy white hair and a full white beard is shown walking up a grassy hill. He is dressed in a blue long-sleeved shirt, brown trousers, and suspenders. Initially, only his head and shoulders are visible, but as he moves forward, his full torso is revealed. He is already holding two large, beige cloth sacks, one in each hand, which become visible as he ascends further up the hill. The focus then shifts to his lower body, showing his legs and the two sacks he carries.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events but misses the opportunity to describe the quality and effort of the man's motion. While it states he \"walks up a grassy hill,\" it could be more specific by describing his gait as slow and labored, clearly showing the strain of ascending the slope while burdened. The description of the sacks is good, but the caption fails to mention how their weight impacts his posture; for instance, it could note that the heavy sacks pull his arms straight and cause him to lean forward to maintain balance. Furthermore, the phrase \"the camera then focuses on his lower body\" is vague; a more precise description, such as \"the video then cuts to a close-up of his legs and feet,\" would better convey the shot transition and highlight the heavy, deliberate steps he takes on the uneven ground. The final sentence is slightly redundant by restating that he is carrying the sacks, as this has already been established.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An elderly man slowly and laboriously ascends a grassy hill, moving towards the camera. His gait is deliberate, clearly showing the strain of climbing the slope while burdened.
