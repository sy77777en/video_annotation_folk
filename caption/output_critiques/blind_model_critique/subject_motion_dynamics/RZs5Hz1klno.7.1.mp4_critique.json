  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes a static scene. It correctly identifies the main subject (a cube), its state (sitting), and the surrounding environment (snow-covered mountains, overcast sky, blue light).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. For a video with no movement, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The caption successfully does this by stating it is a \"static shot\" and describing the cube as it \"sits\" in the landscape, which implies a lack of motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to some instructions but violates a key one.\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   It correctly follows the rule for static videos.\n    *   It is concise and presented as a single paragraph.\n    *   It avoids speculation and ambiguity.\n    *   It focuses on the scene's state rather than inventing motion.\n\n*   **Where it needs improvement:**\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses several subjective words.\n        *   \"**surreal** landscape\": \"Surreal\" is an interpretation of the scene's mood and style, not an objective description.\n        *   \"**gloomy**, overcast sky\": \"Gloomy\" is an emotional adjective. A more objective description would be just \"overcast sky.\"\n        *   \"**cold**, blue light\": \"Cold\" describes a feeling or quality associated with the light, not the light itself. The objective part is \"blue light.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is good at identifying the static nature of the video but fails to remain objective as required by the instructions. A better caption would remove the subjective adjectives.",
