    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned in the foreground. The airplane's wing is engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke billowing out. The explosion intensifies, causing the flames and smoke to spread further, creating a large fireball. The fireball continues to expand, with the flames and smoke becoming more prominent and widespread. The intensity of the explosion starts to diminish slightly, but the airplane remains heavily affected by the fire. The flames and smoke begin to dissipate, leaving behind a significant amount of black smoke. The scene shows the airplane with less intense flames and more smoke, indicating the aftermath of the explosion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned prominently in the foreground. The aircraft is partially engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing. The explosion creates a dramatic contrast against the night setting, with the flames illuminating the scene. In the background, a hangar with bright lights is visible, providing a stark contrast to the dark sky. The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is moderately effective but has several significant issues regarding adherence to the specific instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption accurately describes the chronological sequence of events: an explosion occurs on an airplane's wing, it intensifies into a fireball, and then it begins to dissipate, leaving smoke. The elements described (airplane, flames, smoke, fireball) are correct.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete in that it covers the entire motion sequence from the start of the explosion to its aftermath. It successfully captures the key phases of the event. However, it fails to mention if the airplane itself is moving or stationary, which is a key detail about the primary subject's motion.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption falls short in several key areas:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Appearance:** The very first sentence, \"The video shows a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned in the foreground,\" directly violates the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details\" and \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption should begin immediately with the action.\n*   **Conciseness and Repetition:** The caption is not concise. It is repetitive in its description of the fire and smoke. For example, the sentences \"The explosion intensifies, causing the flames and smoke to spread further...\" and \"The fireball continues to expand, with the flames and smoke becoming more prominent...\" describe the same phase of the event and could be combined for better clarity and brevity.\n*   **Use of Simple, Natural English:** Phrases like \"The video shows...\" and \"The scene shows...\" are unnecessary introductory clauses that make the language less direct and natural. The instruction implies the output should *be* the description, not a description *of* the description.\n*   **Abstract/Interpretive Descriptions:** The final phrase, \"indicating the aftermath of the explosion,\" is an interpretation rather than a direct description of motion. A better approach would be to simply describe what is visibly happening (e.g., \"the flames subside while a large plume of smoke continues to rise\").\n*   **Subjective Language:** The phrase \"heavily affected\" is borderline subjective and less descriptive than stating the observable facts (e.g., \"the wing remains engulfed in flames\").\n\n### Summary\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the event and its timeline, it fails to follow several core instructions. It is not concise, includes unnecessary descriptions of the subject's static appearance, uses weak introductory phrases, and contains repetitive language.\n\nA better caption would be a single, concise paragraph that starts directly with the action, like this:\n\n**\"An explosion erupts on the wing of a passenger airplane, sending flames and thick black smoke billowing outward. The resulting fireball rapidly expands and intensifies before the flames begin to diminish, leaving a large plume of smoke rising from the damaged wing.\"**",
