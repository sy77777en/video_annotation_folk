    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with light brown skin and long, curly hair that is a mix of brown and blonde. She is wearing a light-colored knit sweater. At different points, she is seen sitting on the floor and looking upward, as well as standing close to a door and facing it. Her facial expression appears worried, and she is oriented toward the door throughout the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** Assuming the video shows the events as described, the caption is accurate. It details a sequence of concrete, observable actions (sitting, looking, standing, moving) without making assumptions about the woman's intent or feelings.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption provides a complete, albeit concise, summary of the subject's motion. It establishes her initial action, follows through with her subsequent movements, and describes her final orientation (\"remaining oriented toward it throughout the video\"), effectively covering the entire sequence of events.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption excels at following the provided guidelines:\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly adheres to this rule by using \"first\" and \"then\" to clearly sequence the actions.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on the woman's movements and changes in posture, avoiding any description of her appearance.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, direct, and easy to understand. It conveys the necessary information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objectivity:** It strictly avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. The description is purely factual.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs and prepositions (\"sits on the floor,\" \"looks upward,\" \"moves closer to the door\") to create a clear mental image of the action, as instructed.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph as required.",
