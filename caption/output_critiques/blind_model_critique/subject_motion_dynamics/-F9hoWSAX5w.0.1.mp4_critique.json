    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man with short hair approaching a turnstile in a subway station. He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes. As he reaches the turnstile, he passes through it, moving towards the area indicated for \"Red Line trains.\" The setting is clearly a subway station, with signage above the turnstiles guiding passengers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with short hair passing through the turnstile. He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes, with his back turned slightly towards the camera. The setting is a subway station, indicated by the signage for the \"Red Line trains\" above the turnstiles. **",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the events is accurate. The subject, a man, does approach and pass through a turnstile in a subway station.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption describes the primary sequence of motion from beginning to end.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption violates the following instructions:\n    *   **Fails to Focus on Motion:** The instruction states, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption violates this by dedicating a full sentence to the man's appearance (\"He is wearing a long, dark coat and white shoes\") and mentioning his \"short hair.\" These details are about the subject's static appearance, not his movement.\n    *   **Includes Unnecessary Setting Description:** The final sentence, \"The setting is clearly a subway station, with signage above the turnstiles guiding passengers,\" describes the static environment. The instructions require the description to focus on the subject's motion, and this information is not essential to understanding that motion.\n    *   **Uses Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows,\" which is an unnecessary introductory phrase. The instructions ask for only the video description itself.\n\nA better caption that follows all instructions would be:\n\n\"A man walks toward a turnstile, passes through it, and continues walking toward an area for the Red Line trains.\"",
