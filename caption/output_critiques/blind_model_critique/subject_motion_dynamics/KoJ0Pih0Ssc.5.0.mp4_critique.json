    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a series of rusted metal barricades, known as Czech hedgehogs, aligned parallel to a wire fence on their right across a sandy area. These structures are dark brown and have a cross-like shape, with visible bolts and a weathered texture. In the background, there is a tall, cylindrical concrete watchtower with a small, enclosed top section, positioned closer to a tall, smooth concrete wall that runs parallel to the sandy area. Surrounding the area are several multi-story buildings with a modern, utilitarian design, characterized by flat roofs and numerous windows. A single streetlamp stands between the watchtower and the Czech hedgehogs, adding to the urban setting. The scene is well-lit, suggesting daylight, and the overall atmosphere is stark and industrial.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary motion as a slow camera pan to the right. It accurately describes the main subjects as \"rusted, cross-shaped tank traps\" on sandy ground and correctly notes that the background elements (wall, watchtower, buildings) are static. The description of the pan's effect—keeping the foreground in focus while revealing more of the line of traps—is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It covers all the essential visual information and motion within the video. It describes the type of motion (pan), its direction and speed (slowly to the right), the primary subject of the motion (the line of tank traps), and the static context (background). It successfully captures the entire dynamic of the shot without leaving out important details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the given instructions.\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instructions state to focus on the *subject's* motion. In this case, the subjects (tank traps) are static. The caption correctly handles this by describing the only motion present: the camera's. It describes this motion specifically (\"pans slowly to the right\") and its effect on the subjects (\"revealing more of the line\"), which is the best possible way to follow the instructions for a video of this type.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is a perfect length, providing rich detail without being verbose.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description follows the single, continuous action of the pan logically.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** It uses simple, natural English (\"moving along a line,\" \"extending into the distance\") and avoids jargon.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective, or speculative language. \"Rusted\" is a factual, descriptive adjective.\n*   **Specificity:** It is very specific, describing \"cross-shaped tank traps\" and a \"camera pan to the right\" rather than generic terms like \"objects\" or \"the video moves.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, especially in the nuanced scenario where the subjects themselves are static and the only movement comes from the camera. It accurately and completely describes the video's content in a clear, objective, and specific manner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera pans slowly to the right, capturing a line of rusted, cross-shaped tank traps on a sandy patch of ground. As the movement unfolds, the tank traps remain in sharp focus in the foreground, while more of the line is revealed, stretching into the distance alongside a wire fence. The background, featuring a concrete wall, a watchtower, and apartment buildings, remains unchanged.",
