    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A very muscular, dark-skinned man is shown in a low crouch, surrounded by a large, chaotic pile of books. He is shirtless, revealing a highly defined physique, and wears black pants. His face is broad with a stern, intense expression. His left arm is extended, resting on a closed blue book, while his right hand is on his knee. The books around him are of various colors, including green, brown, and blue, with many lying open or stacked haphazardly. Some book covers and pages display unfamiliar symbols and text. During the scene, a few books land on his head and shoulders.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption's description of the books' interaction with the man is too vague; stating they \"land\" on him fails to specify how they arrive. For instance, the video might show the books being dropped from above or carefully placed by an off-screen assistant, a detail that would clarify the nature of the challenge. Furthermore, the chronological order is ambiguous. The phrase \"Throughout the movement, he extends his left hand\" suggests a continuous action, whereas the video likely shows a more distinct sequence, such as the man first stabilizing after the books land and *then* extending his hand to complete the pose. The description \"slightly rises\" could also be more specific; the video may show a controlled, muscular tensing or a subtle shift in weight that a more precise verb would better capture. Finally, the last clause about \"continuing to hold his crouched position\" is somewhat redundant and could be omitted to create a more concise and impactful description focused on the key sequence of actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The muscular man, initially in a low crouch, slowly tenses his muscles and shifts his weight upward. As he does so, three books are dropped from above, striking his head and shoulders. After stabilizing, he extends his left hand to complete the pose, maintaining an intense forward gaze throughout the sequence.",
