    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the view moves forward slightly through a dark interior and turns to the right, looking out a doorway.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is shown from the first-person perspective of a video game character in a dark environment. The character is holding a rifle, which is visible at the bottom of the screen along with a heads-up display showing the ammunition count. The view is from inside a building, looking out through a doorway into a dark, outdoor area at night. In the distance, the rear of a dark gray car is visible. Red and white text appears at the bottom of the screen, displaying dialogue from a character identified as \"Al-Qatala Fighter 2.\"**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the chronological order of events, but it describes the motion in terms of camera effects rather than the subject's actions. For instance, \"the view then zooms in\" is a passive description of what happens on screen; a more accurate description of the subject's motion would be that the subject \"raises a rifle and aims down its telescopic scope.\" The caption also misses an opportunity for specificity by referring to a generic \"rifle's sight\" when the significant zoom implies a telescopic scope with crosshairs, a key visual element of the aiming process. Similarly, \"the view then zooms out\" is the result of the subject lowering the rifle, an action that is entirely omitted from the description. A better caption would directly link the visual changes to the subject's physical movements, such as stating that the subject first pans their view left, then raises a rifle to aim through its scope at the car, and finally lowers the weapon to return to a normal field of view.",
