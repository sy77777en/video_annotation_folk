    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a stylized puppet character with exaggerated facial features, including large eyes and a prominent nose. The puppet has short, dark hair, black eyebrows, and is wearing a red plaid jacket over a light-colored shirt with green lettering. It is seated at a table with two blue cups on a tray. The puppet's head is turned slightly, suggesting it is looking to the side. The setting appears to be a dining area, but the focus remains on the puppet character.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a puppet character) and the objects it is near (table, cups, tray).\n\n**Completeness:** The caption provides a complete, self-contained description of the subject's movements. It establishes a beginning, middle, and end to the sequence of actions, giving a clear picture of what happens in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at this. It uses clear temporal markers (\"begins,\" \"then,\" \"Finally\") to present the actions in the exact order they occur.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on the puppet's movements (\"places its hand,\" \"gestures,\" \"raises its index finger,\" \"points upwards,\" \"turns its head\").\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and gets straight to the point.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. It describes what is happening without interpreting the puppet's feelings or intentions.\n    *   **Specificity:** The actions are described with good detail (e.g., \"raises its index finger and points upwards\" instead of just \"points\").\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The phrase \"**emphasizing a point**\" is an abstract description that interprets the *purpose* of the action rather than describing the physical motion itself. This violates the instruction to \"Avoid abstract descriptions, such as 'The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility'.\" Describing the *intent* behind the gesture is speculative. A more compliant caption would simply state the observable action: \"The puppet raises its index finger and points upwards.\"\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good and follows most of the instructions exceptionally well, particularly regarding chronological order and objective, motion-focused language. The only minor flaw is the inclusion of an abstract interpretation (\"emphasizing a point\"). Removing that single phrase would make the caption fully compliant with all instructions.",
