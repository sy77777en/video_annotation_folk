    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a wooden table with a smooth, polished surface. Initially, two sheets of white paper with handwritten text are visible on the left side of the table. As the camera moves backward slightly, two additional sheets on the right become visible, revealing a total of four sheets of paper. The focus is on the papers and their arrangement on the table.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video described.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. It correctly identifies that the primary motion comes from the camera, not the subjects, and clearly states that the papers are stationary. This provides a complete picture of the visual events.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description follows a logical sequence: the camera moves first (\"pulls back and pans\"), which leads to the consequence of the papers being revealed. This adheres perfectly to the instruction to present actions in chronological order.\n\n*   **Focus on Motion (and lack thereof):** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject’s motion\" and to mention if there is no movement. The caption does both exceptionally well. It describes the only significant motion in the video (the camera's) and then explicitly confirms the subjects' lack of motion (\"The papers themselves remain stationary\"). This is the best way to handle a video with static subjects.\n\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. It avoids jargon, subjective adjectives, and speculation. The two sentences are efficient and convey all the necessary information without unnecessary detail.\n\n*   **Specificity:** The caption is specific without being overly descriptive. It details the camera's movement (\"slowly pulls back and pans slightly to the right\") and what is being revealed (\"four sheets of paper with text\"), which is much better than a generic statement like \"The camera moves to show some papers.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the instructions. It is factual, clear, and correctly prioritizes the description of movement (or the lack of it) to create an informative and concise summary of the video's content.",
