    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man in a gray suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie, identified as Robert Kardashian, speaking while looking down. He then raises his head slightly and looks forward. The background is a well-lit indoor setting with other individuals present, including a man in a white cap and a camera, indicating a press or public event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a gray suit with a white shirt and a patterned tie, who appears to be the main subject. He has medium-length dark hair with a small patch of gray at the front and a focused expression, suggesting he is engaged in a serious activity, possibly speaking or reading. To his left, a man with a beard and long hair, wearing a white cap backwards and a casual white shirt, holds a camera, indicating he is capturing the event. Another man, partially visible, stands behind the main subject, dressed in a light blue collared shirt, adding to the sense of a public or press event. The main subject's demeanor and attire contrast with the more casual appearance of the secondary subjects, highlighting his central role.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly outlines the basic sequence of events, it lacks the specific detail that would be visible in the video. The description of him \"speaking while looking down\" is too general; the video likely shows him deliberately reading from a document placed on a lectern or table, with his eyes methodically scanning the text. The subsequent action, \"raises his head slightly and looks forward,\" understates the motion's significance. A more accurate description would be that he pauses his reading, lifts his head, and fixes his gaze directly at the cameras, creating a distinct shift in focus. The caption also fails to describe the motion in the background, which is integral to the scene; as he looks up, the video would almost certainly show a concurrent flurry of camera flashes from the press corps, a key visual element of the interaction that is currently omitted.",
