    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays two characters within an interior space. The primary character, positioned centrally, is clad in armor with a green cloak and is holding a bow and arrow. Another character, dressed in armor with a blue cloak, stands near a doorway to the right. Both characters' attire suggests a fantasy or historical setting.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and presents their movements in chronological order, but it lacks specificity and fails to capture the dynamic nature of the actions. The repeated use of the generic verb \"moves\" is a key weakness; for example, the video might show the character in green armor *strafing* left and up while aiming a weapon, then *dashing* down and right. The description of the interaction is also too simple. When the blue character \"turns to face\" the green one, a more crucial detail might be that they simultaneously *raise a plasma rifle* or *activate an energy shield*, indicating a shift from patrolling to a combat-ready stance. Furthermore, the phrase \"reverses direction\" is vague; a more precise description could be \"pivots sharply\" or \"makes a quick turn.\" Lastly, the caption ends ambiguously by stating the green character moves \"towards the door\" without describing the conclusion of the action, such as stopping to interact with a console next to the door or taking cover beside its frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The central character in green armor strafes left and up while aiming a weapon, then dashes down and right. Meanwhile, the character in blue armor near the doorway pivots sharply to face the green character, simultaneously raising a plasma rifle and activating an energy shield, signaling a shift to a combat-ready stance. The green character then moves towards the door, stopping to interact with a console next to it.",
