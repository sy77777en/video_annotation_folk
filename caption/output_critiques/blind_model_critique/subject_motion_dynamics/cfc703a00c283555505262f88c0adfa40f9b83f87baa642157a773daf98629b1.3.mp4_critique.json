  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of a video featuring a river in a natural setting. It correctly identifies the main elements like the river, rocks, greenery, and mountains.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in that it describes both the moving element (the river) and the static background. However, it provides excessive detail about the static scenery, which goes against the instruction to focus on motion.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following ways:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses several subjective words like \"scenic,\" \"lush,\" \"calm,\" and \"natural,\" which describe a feeling or an opinion about the scene rather than providing an objective description of motion.\n2.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instructions explicitly say, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The caption violates this rule by using the phrase \"The water appears to be moving steadily.\"\n3.  **Lack of Focus on Motion:** The instructions emphasize focusing on the subject's motion. While the caption mentions the river is \"flowing\" and \"creating gentle ripples,\" it dedicates the first full sentence to describing the static landscape (\"rocky landscape,\" \"lush greenery,\" \"distant mountains,\" \"clear blue sky\"). For a scenery shot, the instructions state to \"briefly note this in one to three sentences,\" but the caption's focus is too heavily weighted on the non-moving elements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a river flowing steadily through a rocky landscape, creating gentle ripples and small waves. The focus is on the movement of the water, with a brief glimpse of the surrounding greenery and mountains under a clear sky.",
