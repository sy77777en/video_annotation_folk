  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily by focusing heavily on static visual details rather than motion.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is accurate in its description of the scene. It correctly identifies a traditional Korean pavilion, a flag, and the swaying leaves of the trees.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete in that it identifies the only motion present in the video (the swaying leaves).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption dedicates the majority of its text to describing the static appearance of the pavilion (\"intricate designs and vibrant colors,\" \"situated on a stone platform,\" \"roof and columns are adorned with detailed patterns\"). This is a direct violation of the core instruction.\n*   **Violation of \"No Movement\" Rule:** The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The main subject, the pavilion, has no movement. Instead of briefly mentioning this, the caption describes its appearance in great detail.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** Because the caption includes extensive descriptions of static elements, it is not concise. A caption following the instructions would be much shorter.\n*   **Inference:** The phrase \"indicating a light breeze\" is an inference. While it's a logical conclusion, the instructions advise to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" A more direct description would be to simply state that the leaves and flag are swaying.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nA better caption that follows all instructions would be:\n\nA stationary traditional Korean pavilion is shown in a park, while the leaves on the surrounding trees and a flag hanging from a branch sway throughout the video.",
