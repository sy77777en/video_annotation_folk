    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of an empty narrow, green train corridor. A door at the end of the corridor opens, and two men start to enter. The first man, wearing a green cap, green pants, a white short-sleeved shirt with a tie, and a dark green vest, carries a wrapped object that resembles a tree. The second man, dressed in a dark coat, green pants, a white shirt with a tie, and a Santa hat, holds a white object. The men continue to walk down the corridor, with the first man leading and the second man following closely behind. The corridor features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, enhancing the vintage train ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with an empty narrow, green train corridor. A door opens, and two men enter the frame. The first man is wearing a green cap, green pants, a white short-sleeved shirt with a tie, and a dark green vest. He carries a wrapped object that resembles a tree. The second man is dressed in a dark coat, green pants, a white shirt with a tie, and a Santa hat. He holds a white object, the nature of which is unclear. The corridor features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, enhancing the vintage train ambiance. As the men move closer to the camera, their attire and the objects they carry become more visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and presents their actions in chronological order, but it overemphasizes static descriptions of their clothing and the corridor's appearance rather than focusing on the specifics of their motion. The description of the men's movement is too generic; for instance, instead of just \"enters,\" the caption could describe how the first man has to turn sideways to maneuver the bulky tree through the narrow doorway, perhaps brushing it against the frame. Similarly, \"follows closely behind\" could be improved by detailing the second man's specific actions, such as him pausing momentarily to pull the door shut before hurrying to catch up. The description of the objects is also vague and speculative (\"resembles a tree,\" \"a white object\"); a better caption would definitively identify them based on the visual, such as \"carrying a small tree wrapped in burlap\" or \"holding a stack of white boxes.\" Finally, the phrase \"vintage train ambiance\" is a subjective interpretation and should be omitted in favor of describing the concrete movements that create the scene.",
