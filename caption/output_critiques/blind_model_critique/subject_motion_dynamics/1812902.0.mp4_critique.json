    "pre_caption": "The video shows an aerial view of a large, fortified structure situated on a rocky outcrop surrounded by deep blue ocean waters. The structure appears to be a historical or military fortress, with multiple levels and walls, and is surrounded by several buildings with red-tiled roofs. The camera slowly rotates around the structure, providing different angles and perspectives of the fortress and its surroundings. The ocean waves crash against the base of the structure, creating white foam. In the background, a few boats can be seen moving on the water, leaving trails behind them.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the video's content. It correctly identifies an aerial view of a fortified structure on a rocky outcrop, the surrounding ocean, the camera's movement, the crashing waves, and the boats in the background.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in that it mentions all the primary and secondary motions visible in the video: the camera's rotation, the crashing waves, and the moving boats.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to follow several key instructions:\n\n1.  **Focus on Motion:** The first two sentences are dedicated to a static description of the structure (\"a large, fortified structure situated on a rocky outcrop,\" \"multiple levels and walls,\" \"buildings with red-tiled roofs\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption spends too much time describing what the subject *is* rather than what it *does*.\n\n2.  **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption uses the phrase \"The structure **appears to be** a historical or military fortress.\" This is a direct violation of the rule to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n\n3.  **Conciseness:** Because the caption includes extensive static descriptions, it is not as concise as it could be. A good caption would eliminate these details and focus purely on the movement.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the scene, it fails to adhere to the core requirements of focusing strictly on motion, avoiding speculation, and maintaining conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dynamic aerial view as the camera smoothly rotates around a large fortress perched on a rocky outcrop, surrounded by the deep blue ocean. Waves crash energetically against the base, creating white foam, while boats glide across the water, leaving trails in their wake.",
