    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair with bangs is shown lying in bed in a dimly lit, cool-toned room. Initially, she is asleep, her head resting on a pillow with a black and white geometric pattern. She is wearing a dark top and is covered up to her shoulders by a red and green plaid blanket. She then wakes up, opening her eyes and looking forward with a still, slightly alert expression.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** A woman lies still in bed, asleep. She then opens her eyes and looks forward, remaining motionless in the bed.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject's initial state of stillness and the specific, minimal action that follows. The description of her remaining motionless after opening her eyes is also a precise detail.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete. It covers the entire sequence of events in the video, from the initial static state to the single, distinct action, and the resulting final state, leaving out no essential motion.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption does an excellent job of following the provided guidelines.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly presents the actions in chronological order, using the word \"then\" to clearly separate the initial state from the subsequent action.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It focuses entirely on the subject's motion (or lack thereof), describing the state of \"lying still\" and the specific action of \"opens her eyes and looks forward.\"\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and very clear. It delivers the information efficiently without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The description is objective and free of emotional, subjective, or abstract language.\n    *   **Specificity:** The action \"opens her eyes and looks forward\" is specific and descriptive. The description of her being \"still\" and \"motionless\" is also a specific and accurate way to describe a lack of movement.\n    *   **No Speculation:** While \"asleep\" is an inference, it is a very strong and contextually appropriate one that clarifies the initial state before the main action. It serves to set the scene effectively without being overly speculative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions, providing a description that is accurate, complete, concise, and objective. It perfectly captures the essential motion in a clear and chronological manner.",
