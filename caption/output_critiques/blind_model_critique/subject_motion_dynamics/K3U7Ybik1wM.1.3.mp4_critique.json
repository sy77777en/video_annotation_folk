    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective, the video shows a person with fair skin looking down while walking. Their bare foot, with red-painted toenails, is visible at the bottom of the frame, along with the hem of their blue pants. Then, the subject walks toward a carpeted staircase with wooden banisters on either side. At the bottom of the stairs, a small, white-and-black object, possibly a stuffed animal or a small pet, is sitting. A wavy, distorting visual effect is applied to the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the subject's motion (walking, descending), the key object they interact with (staircase), and the corresponding camera movement (tilting down).\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, capturing the entire sequence of motion from walking forward to beginning the descent down the stairs. It includes relevant details like the \"bare foot\" and the \"carpeted\" staircase, which help paint a clearer picture of the scene without being excessive.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a perfect chronological sequence: walking forward, approaching the stairs, and then descending as the camera tilts.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption is centered on the subject's movement (\"walks forward,\" \"approach,\" \"descend\") and the camera's motion (\"tilts down\"), as required for a first-person video.\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and gets straight to the point.\n*   **Objective and Factual:** The caption avoids subjective adjectives, speculation (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and abstract descriptions. It sticks to what is visibly happening.\n*   **Specific Actions:** It uses specific verbs like \"descend\" and describes the camera \"tilts down,\" which is more descriptive than a generic statement.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent because it precisely follows all instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and informative description of the subject's motion.",
