    "pre_caption": "The video shows a flying vehicle descending towards a platform in space. The vehicle, with a dark, angular design and illuminated elements, gradually becomes more visible as it approaches the platform. The vehicle's surface reflects the surrounding light, highlighting its metallic and futuristic appearance. The vehicle finally lands on the platform, with its full structure now clearly visible, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small portion of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right corner, showing a dark, angular structure with illuminated elements. As the vehicle descends, it becomes fully visible, revealing a sleek, futuristic design with glowing red and blue lights. The vehicle's surface appears metallic and reflective, with distinct geometric shapes. The video concludes with a wide shot of the vehicle resting on the platform, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures, emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption accurately describes the general events in the video: a vehicle descends and lands on a platform in space.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption is complete in that it covers the entire sequence of motion from the beginning of the video to the end.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the following instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Appearance:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to \"Avoid describing the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption dedicates significant space to appearance (\"dark, angular design,\" \"illuminated elements,\" \"metallic and futuristic appearance\"), which is a direct violation.\n*   **Avoid Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is forbidden by the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses the word \"futuristic,\" which is a subjective and interpretive adjective.\n*   **Avoid Abstract Descriptions:** The phrase \"highlighting its metallic and futuristic appearance\" is an abstract interpretation of the light's effect, not a direct description of the subject's motion.\n\n**In summary:** While the caption correctly identifies the chronological actions, it is heavily flawed by its inclusion of forbidden introductory text, excessive focus on the vehicle's appearance, and use of subjective and abstract language. It prioritizes what the vehicle looks like over how it moves.\n\nA better caption that adheres to all instructions would be:\n\n**A flying vehicle descends toward a platform in space. It slows its descent as it approaches, then touches down and settles onto the platform's surface.**",
