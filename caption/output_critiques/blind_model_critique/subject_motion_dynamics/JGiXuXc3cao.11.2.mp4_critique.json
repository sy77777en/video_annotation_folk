    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two men in matching yellow, long-sleeved collared shirts are depicted sitting side-by-side. The man on the left, who has blondish-green hair in a bowl cut, leans forward with his head bowed. He presses his left hand to his forehead, covering his eyes, while his right hand holds a purple object resembling his glasses. To his right sits another man with dark, neatly combed hair and glasses. This man holds a white mug in his right hand and covers his mouth and nose with his left hand as he looks down.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the content of the video, stating that the two subjects are part of an animated illustration and that they do not move. It correctly identifies the state of the subjects.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It fulfills the core requirement of describing the subjects' motion (or lack thereof). It adheres to the specific instruction for static subjects: \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows all the provided guidelines:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It exclusively describes the lack of motion, which is the central point.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The single sentence is brief yet provides all the necessary information about the action (or inaction) in the video.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses neutral, factual language (\"remain completely still\") and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   **Certainty:** It makes a definitive statement about what is visible, avoiding speculative phrases like \"appear to be.\"\n*   **Simplicity:** The language is simple, clear, and natural.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The description is concrete and direct.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an excellent example of how to apply the instructions to a video with no subject movement. It is precise, concise, and perfectly aligned with all the rules.",
