    "pre_caption": "A man in a green uniform is standing by a window, talking on a phone with his left hand while his right hand is on his hip. The background includes a wall with several clipboards, a red chair, a desk with a lamp, and a green bulletin board with papers pinned to it. The camera then moves to the right, showing a green door labeled 'COACH' and a window. The camera continues to move right, revealing a kitchen area with cabinets, dishes, and a counter with various items like a green bowl, a brown bowl, and a stack of plates.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a green uniform, including a green hat with red lettering, a dark green vest, green pants, and a white short-sleeved shirt. He is standing by a window while speaking on a phone and is wearing a watch on his left hand. The setting appears to be an office or control room with clipboards on the wall and a desk with various items like a lamp and papers. As the video progresses,  the scene transitions to a kitchen area on a train, with cabinets, dishes, and a window.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject's initial actions in chronological order, but it lacks specificity and improperly focuses on static background elements. The description \"turns his head to the right and speaks\" is too general; it could be improved by detailing the quality of the motion, such as if he turns his head slowly to look out the window or abruptly as if responding to something off-camera. The most significant issue is the extensive listing of static objects like clipboards, a chair, and kitchen items, which violates the instruction to focus on motion. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the relationship between the subject and the camera's movement. When the camera \"moves to the right,\" it is crucial to state what happens to the man—does the camera pan away from him, leaving him out of frame, or does it follow him as he begins to walk? A more accurate description would clarify this interaction, for instance: \"The man turns his head to the right, and the camera then begins a slow pan to the right, moving away from the man's static position to reveal a green door and an adjacent kitchen area.\"",
