    "pre_caption": "A man in a green uniform is standing by a window, talking on a phone with his left hand while his right hand is on his hip. The background includes a wall with several clipboards, a red chair, a desk with a lamp, and a green bulletin board with papers pinned to it. The camera then moves to the right, showing a green door labeled 'COACH' and a window. The camera continues to move right, revealing a kitchen area with cabinets, dishes, and a counter with various items like a green bowl, a brown bowl, and a stack of plates.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a green uniform, including a green hat with red lettering, a dark green vest, green pants, and a white short-sleeved shirt. He is standing by a window while speaking on a phone and is wearing a watch on his left hand. The setting appears to be an office or control room with clipboards on the wall and a desk with various items like a lamp and papers. As the video progresses,  the scene transitions to a kitchen area on a train, with cabinets, dishes, and a window.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it is factually accurate and follows a chronological order, it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the man, the camera movement, and the objects in the room is factually correct.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption describes the main events: the initial shot of the man and the subsequent camera pan.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** This is where the caption fails significantly.\n    *   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The core instruction is to \"Focus on the subject’s motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption dedicates more than half of its length to listing static background objects (clipboards, chair, desk, lamp, bulletin board, cabinets, dishes, bowls, plates). This shifts the focus from motion to a static inventory of the scene.\n    *   **Violation of \"Concise\":** The detailed list of background items makes the caption unnecessarily long and not concise. A good caption would mention the camera revealing a kitchen area without listing its contents.\n    *   **Subject's Motion:** The description of the man \"standing... talking on a phone\" is adequate but could be more focused. The primary motion in the video is the camera's pan to the right. While the caption describes this, the motion aspect is diluted by the excessive description of static objects.\n\nIn summary, the caption is poor because it functions more as a detailed inventory of the room's contents rather than a concise, motion-focused description as required by the instructions. It buries the essential information about the camera's movement under a list of non-essential, static details.",
