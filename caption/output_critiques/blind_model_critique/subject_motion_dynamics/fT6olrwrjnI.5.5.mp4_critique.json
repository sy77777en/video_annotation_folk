    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **An anime-style young man with spiky white hair and an intense, shouting expression is captured in the middle of a soccer kick. He wears a white and black sleeveless jersey with the number \"7\" on the front, layered over a black long-sleeved undershirt. His uniform also consists of white shorts with black details, black compression leggings, and blue bands around his knees. While sliding on a green field, his right leg is extended high, positioned next to a classic black and white soccer ball, which is airborne near the sole of his cleated shoe.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the core action, but it could be more precise about the sequence and physical dynamics of the movement. The term \"simultaneously\" might be inaccurate; it's more likely the character initiates the slide and then, during the slide, extends his leg for the kick. A more detailed description of the character's posture, such as how he supports his body with his other limbs during the slide, would provide a clearer picture of this complex athletic maneuver. Furthermore, the caption describes a visual effect (\"Motion lines blur the background\") rather than the subject's motion or the direct result of that motion. It would be more effective to describe the consequence of the forceful kick, such as the soccer ball deforming upon impact or rocketing away with a visible trail. Finally, the description ends abruptly at the moment of impact; describing what happens immediately after—whether the character continues to slide or how the ball travels—would provide a more complete account of the action in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An anime character initiates a slide across a green field, his body low to the ground as he supports himself with his left hand and leg. As he gains momentum, he extends his right leg high into the air, striking a soccer ball with the sole of his cleated shoe. The force of the kick causes the ball to deform slightly before rocketing away, leaving a visible trail in its wake. The character continues to slide gracefully, maintaining balance and control as the ball soars across the field.",
