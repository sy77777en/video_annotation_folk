    "pre_caption": "The man, standing in a dimly lit environment with greenish lighting, initially faces sideways and then turns to face forward. He raises his hand to his face, possibly adjusting his bandana or making a gesture. He then turns to face the camera, raising his hand and pointing upwards with his index finger. Subsequently, he points to his head with his finger, maintaining a gesture that suggests he is emphasizing a point or making a statement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a medium build wearing a stylish bandana and a jacket over a shirt with a visible graphic or text. In one part of the video, he is standing and facing sideways, while in another, he faces forward, gesturing with his hand near his head. The setting appears to be dimly lit with a greenish tint, suggesting the use of night vision or low-light conditions.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates several key instructions, particularly regarding speculation and abstract interpretation.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the man's physical movements (turning, raising his hand, pointing) appears to be accurate and is presented in the correct chronological order.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers the sequence of the man's actions from the beginning to the end of the video, making it complete in its description of his motion.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following significant ways:\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The instruction explicitly states, \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n    *   The phrase \"**possibly** adjusting his bandana or making a gesture\" is a direct violation of this rule. It speculates on the purpose of the action rather than just describing the action itself.\n    *   The phrase \"**suggests** he is emphasizing a point or making a statement\" is also speculative. It interprets the meaning behind the gesture, which is forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Abstract Descriptions\":** The instruction states to avoid abstract descriptions like \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\"\n    *   The phrase \"maintaining a gesture that suggests he is **emphasizing a point or making a statement**\" is an abstract interpretation of the subject's intent, not a description of his physical motion.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The instruction asks to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n    *   The caption begins by describing the setting (\"in a dimly lit environment with greenish lighting\"). While potentially helpful for context, it describes the static environment rather than the subject's motion, which is the primary focus required by the instructions.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nTo better align with the instructions, the caption should be revised to describe only the observable, physical movements without any interpretation. A good caption would look like this:\n\n\"The man, initially facing sideways, turns to face forward and raises his hand toward his face. He then turns to face the camera, raises his hand, points his index finger upward, and subsequently points the same finger to the side of his head.\"",
