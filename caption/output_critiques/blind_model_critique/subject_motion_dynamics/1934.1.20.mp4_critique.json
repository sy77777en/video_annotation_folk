    "pre_caption": "The video shows a group of four people, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of them, a man wearing a red top hat with a small brown band around the base, stands out among the others. The man in the red hat turns his head to the right and begins speaking to the group. The screen in front of them displays a small, white figure that starts to move.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of four people, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of them, a man distinguished by a red top hat with a small brown band around the base, stands out among the others. The three other individuals, whose faces are not visible, are focused on the screen, which displays a small, white figure. The scene suggests a setting where the group is observing or analyzing something on the screen.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\nThe caption is moderately effective but fails to follow several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate, chronological description of the events in the video. It correctly identifies the subjects, the main subject's actions (turning his head, speaking), and the motion of the figure on the screen.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete, step-by-step account of the primary motions. It establishes the initial scene, describes the main subject's action, and then the action of the object they are observing. The chronological order is correct.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in the sequence they occur: people are gathered, one man turns and speaks, a figure on the screen moves.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It successfully transitions from a static description of the scene to the specific motions of the man and the on-screen figure.\n*   **No Speculation or Ambiguity:** It avoids words like \"might\" or \"appears.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Unnecessary Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is redundant and explicitly discouraged by the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown or introductory text.\"\n*   **Excessive Appearance Details:** The description \"a man wearing a red top hat with a small brown band around the base\" violates the rule to \"Avoid describing the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Simply stating \"a man in a red hat\" is sufficient for differentiation. The detail about the brown band is unnecessary.\n*   **Subjective Language:** The phrase \"stands out among the others\" is an interpretation of the visual composition, not a neutral description of motion or fact. The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** By removing the introductory phrase, the subjective comment, and the excessive appearance details, the caption would be more concise and direct, better adhering to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n**A better caption following all instructions would look like this:**\n\nA group of four people in white protective suits are gathered around a screen. One person, wearing a red top hat, turns their head to the right and speaks to the others. On the screen, a small white figure begins to move.",
