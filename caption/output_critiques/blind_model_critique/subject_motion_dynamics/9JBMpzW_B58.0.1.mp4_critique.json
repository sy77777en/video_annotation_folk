  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. The caption uses subjective and emotional language such as \"breathtaking\" and \"spectacular canvas,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions. It correctly identifies the moving elements (stars, clouds) but describes their motion in very general terms (\"rotation of the stars,\" \"movement of clouds\"). A more effective description would specify the direction and nature of this movement; for example, it could state that the stars arc from left to right across the upper frame while clouds drift in the opposite direction across the middle of the sky. Most importantly, the caption completely omits the motion of the primary subject—the ship. In the video, the bow of the ship is likely seen rising and falling rhythmically with the ocean swells, causing the horizon to shift up and down. This constant, gentle motion from the viewpoint subject is a crucial detail that provides context for all other movements and should be the foundational element of the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video captures the view from the bow of a large ship sailing on the open ocean at night. The ship's bow rises and falls rhythmically with the ocean swells, causing the horizon to shift up and down. Above, countless stars arc from left to right across the upper frame, while clouds drift in the opposite direction across the middle of the sky. The video highlights the celestial rotation and cloud movement over the dark sea, providing a dynamic perspective of the night sky.",
