    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera descends and moves forward over a large, paved area configured as an extreme sports course. As the descent continues, the shadow of a person with a rectangular parachute becomes visible on the ground. The shadow travels across the concrete, moving towards the ramps, as the parachutist continues to descend toward the landing area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's arm, adorned with a yellow wristband and clad in a black and white vertically striped sleeve, is visible in the foreground. The view looks down upon a large, paved concrete area set up as an extreme sports course. The course includes a large blue quarter-pipe, a smaller blue and black ramp, several small black wedge ramps, and a circular landing target with a white outer ring and a black center. As the perspective moves, the distinct shadow of a person attached to a rectangular parachute is cast upon the ground, indicating that the viewpoint is that of a parachutist descending toward the course.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and the chronological order of the descent, but it feels incomplete and lacks specificity regarding the climax of the action. The description stops while the parachutist is still descending, but a video of this nature would almost certainly show the landing itself. The feedback should include a description of the final moments, such as the parachutist flaring the canopy to slow down, their feet touching the paved ground, and then running a few steps forward to come to a stop. Furthermore, the phrase \"descends and moves forward\" is a bit generic; a more precise term like \"glides\" would better capture the controlled forward flight of a rectangular parachute. The caption could also be more specific about the shadow's path, for instance, by describing it gliding directly over a specific obstacle like a half-pipe or a set of grind rails just before the landing, which would better integrate the subject's motion with the unique environment.",
