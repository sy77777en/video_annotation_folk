    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a black-and-white scene, two men are on a central staircase. The man positioned higher on the stairs is a large individual with a prominent dark beard and mustache, wearing a dark suit. He is leaning forward with his hands outstretched, as if trying to assist. Below him, a smaller man with a dark mustache and a dark suit appears to be attempting to move down the stairs but seems to have fallen midway. To the left, a woman with dark, styled hair stands near a counter. She is wearing a dark coat with wide, white fur trim on the cuffs and collar over a lighter-colored dress.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological overview, but it lacks specificity regarding the physical interactions and the nature of the movements. The description of the first man \"appearing to reach\" is vague; the video likely shows him flailing his arms wildly to maintain balance while running in place, rather than making a clear gesture toward the other man. For the second man, the cause of his stumble is omitted. It would be more descriptive to state that he trips over his own feet while trying to hurry past the first man, then tumbles backward before landing in a seated position on the moving steps. The description of the woman as completely \"stationary\" and \"without moving\" is likely inaccurate; a more realistic depiction would be to mention that her head turns to follow the chaotic action on the escalator, even if her body remains in one spot. Finally, the caption could be more concise by describing the first man as \"running in place against the escalator's upward motion\" instead of explaining the physics of why he remains in the same spot.",
