After juggling, the mouse throws the olives into the air. The mouse then picks up the stick and starts dancing energetically. Finally, the mouse looks forward with a surprised expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features an animated mouse standing on a windowsill. The mouse is anthropomorphic, with large ears, a small nose, and a tail, holding a stick in one hand. It is positioned between a bowl of green olives and a tall goblet containing a clear liquid. Initially, the mouse faces sideways to the camera and only turns to face the viewer at the end. The mouse's expression is alert, and its atypical, cartoon-like appearance is the main focus.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved by adhering more strictly to the instruction to avoid subjective descriptions.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows the events as described, the caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a mouse), the objects it interacts with (a stick of olives), and the sequence of actions.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It covers the entire sequence of events from the initial camera movement that reveals the subject to the subject's final action, providing a full summary of the motion in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at presenting the actions in chronological order, using clear transitional words like \"begins to,\" \"After,\" \"then,\" and \"Finally.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It effectively describes the subject's motion with specific action verbs (\"juggles,\" \"throws,\" \"picks up,\" \"dancing\") and the camera's motion (\"zooms in\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Object Interaction:** It clearly specifies how the mouse interacts with the olives and the stick.\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption avoids speculative language and states the actions directly.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The main weakness is the final phrase, \"with a surprised expression.\" The word \"surprised\" is an interpretation of an emotion, which violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" A better, more objective description would focus on the observable physical changes, such as \"stops dancing and looks forward with wide eyes and an open mouth.\"\n*   The word \"energetically\" is also slightly subjective, but it is a common adverb used to describe a type of motion. While acceptable for conciseness, a more objective alternative could be \"dances by moving its limbs rapidly.\" However, the use of \"surprised\" is a more significant deviation from the instructions.",
