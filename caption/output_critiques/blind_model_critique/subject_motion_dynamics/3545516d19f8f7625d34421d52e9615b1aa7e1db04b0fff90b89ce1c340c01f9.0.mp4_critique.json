    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up aerial view of a coastal area featuring a white lighthouse with a red top, surrounded by a few buildings, including a red-roofed house and a small structure with a red roof. The camera gradually moves backward, revealing more of the coastline, which is lined with rocks and a sandy beach. As the camera continues to pull back, the surrounding landscape becomes visible, showing a dense forest extending into the distance. The sea is calm, with gentle waves lapping against the shore. A tall structure, possibly a communication tower, is seen near the forest. The camera movement is smooth and steady, providing a comprehensive view of the coastal landscape, the lighthouse, the buildings, and the natural surroundings.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few significant issues that prevent it from fully adhering to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   The caption accurately describes a common type of aerial video: a reveal shot of a coastal landmark. The sequence of events—starting close on the lighthouse and pulling back to show the wider landscape—is described correctly.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The description is chronologically sound, starting with the initial frame and following the camera's movement to the end.\n*   It successfully captures the primary motion (the camera pulling back) and a secondary motion (the waves lapping).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the caption aligns with the specific rules:\n\n**What it does well:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence (\"begins with a close-up,\" \"camera gradually moves backward,\" \"camera continues to pull back\").\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, easy to understand, and avoids jargon.\n*   **Describes Motion:** It correctly identifies the camera's motion (\"moves backward,\" \"pulls back\") as the central action of the video.\n\n**Where it needs improvement:**\n\n*   **Avoids Speculation (FAILED):** The caption includes the phrase \"**possibly** a communication tower.\" This is a direct violation of the instruction: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The object should either be identified confidently or omitted.\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Static Description (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT):** The first sentence is a lengthy description of static objects (\"a white lighthouse with a red top, surrounded by a few buildings...\"). The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" A better approach would be to integrate the description of the objects into the description of the motion. For example: \"The camera pulls back from a white lighthouse...\"\n*   **Avoids Abstract Descriptions (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT):** The final sentence, \"...providing a comprehensive view of the coastal landscape...\", describes the *purpose* or *effect* of the camera movement, not the movement itself. This is similar to the forbidden abstract example \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\" It's a meta-commentary on the shot's composition rather than a direct description of the action.\n*   **Conciseness (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT):** Due to the lengthy initial description of static elements and the concluding summary sentence, the caption is less concise than it could be. Focusing purely on the motion would make it more direct and impactful.",
