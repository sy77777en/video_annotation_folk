    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of lions resting closely together. The central subject is a lioness with a light tan coat and a white underbelly, lying down with her front paws extended forward. Her ears are perked up, and she initially turns her head to look towards the left side of the frame before turning back to gaze directly ahead with a calm expression. Behind her, partially visible, are three other lionesses, also with similar tan coats. They are positioned closely, suggesting a sense of cohesion and restfulness among the group. The lions are lying on a reddish-brown surface, which contrasts with their fur, highlighting their presence in the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological head movements of the individual lionesses, but it misses more subtle, continuous actions that would better convey the scene. For instance, the main lioness's flank visibly rises and falls with each breath, and her tail occasionally twitches at the tip, details that are central to depicting a resting animal. The method for identifying the other lionesses, such as \"second from the back\" and \"third at the far left,\" is confusing and difficult to track in a video format; it would be clearer to describe them relative to the main subject or as a collective group. Furthermore, the description presents the movements as isolated events. In the video, the main lioness's initial head turn to the left seems to be a direct, slow reaction to the other lioness behind her shifting its position, an interaction that the caption fails to connect. Finally, the caption omits that the third lioness briefly yawns, showing her teeth, before turning her head back to the front, which is a prominent and observable action.",
