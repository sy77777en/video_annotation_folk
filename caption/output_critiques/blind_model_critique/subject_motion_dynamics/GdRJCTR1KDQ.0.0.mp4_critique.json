    "pre_caption": "The video shows a tennis ball bouncing into the frame and making contact with a tennis racket. Upon impact, red and purple dust on the racket disperses in slow motion, creating a striking visual effect. The racket, angled slightly upward, descends due to the force of the ball. As the ball bounces out of the frame, the dust loses its shape and falls, adding dynamic movement against the dark background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a close-up of a tennis ball and a tennis racket. The tennis ball, yellow and textured, bounces into the frame, making contact with the racket. The racket, primarily red and white and angled slightly upward, is covered in red and purple dust, which initially retains the shape of the racket upon impact. This creates a striking visual effect as the dust disperses in slow motion. As the ball bounces out of the frame, the racket descends due to the force, and the dust begins to lose its shape and fall, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The background is dark, enhancing the visibility of the dust and the vibrant colors.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main sequence of events, it lacks the specific detail expected for a slow-motion analysis and includes subjective phrasing. The description of the ball \"bouncing into the frame\" is ambiguous; a more precise account would state the ball travels upward from off-screen to meet the racket. The caption misses a key motion visible in slow motion: the significant compression of the tennis ball against the racket strings at the moment of impact, and the subsequent rebound as it regains its shape. Furthermore, the description of the dust \"dispersing\" could be more vivid; it likely \"explodes outward in a radial cloud\" from the point of contact. The caption also violates the instructions by using abstract and subjective phrases like \"creating a striking visual effect\" and \"adding dynamic movement.\" A better description would integrate the simultaneous actions more effectively, stating that as the ball compresses and rebounds, the racket is pushed backward and downward while the dust cloud erupts from the strings, before slowly drifting and dissipating as the ball exits the frame.",
