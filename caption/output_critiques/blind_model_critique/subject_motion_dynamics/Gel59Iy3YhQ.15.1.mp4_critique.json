    "pre_caption": "Two chef characters move around on a large, rectangular conveyor belt kitchen that rotates clockwise. The chef in the pink hat moves back and forth on the left side of the platform, picking up and preparing ingredients. Simultaneously, the chef in the red hat moves along the right side of the platform, also gathering and preparing food items. Both characters interact with cooking stations and ingredients as the entire kitchen assembly slowly circles the central area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a dynamic scene involving two subjects and a moving environment. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"chef characters,\" their distinct appearances (\"pink hat,\" \"red hat\"), the nature of the platform they are on (\"large, rectangular conveyor belt kitchen\"), and the direction of its movement (\"rotates clockwise\"). The individual actions of each chef are also described precisely.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers all key aspects of motion in the video:\n*   **Overall Scene Motion:** It establishes that the entire \"kitchen assembly slowly circles.\"\n*   **Individual Subject Motion:** It details the separate movements of each chef (\"moves back and forth,\" \"moves along the right side\").\n*   **Object Interaction:** It specifies that the chefs are \"picking up and preparing ingredients\" and interacting with \"cooking stations.\"\n*   **Simultaneous Action:** It correctly uses the word \"simultaneously\" to explain that both chefs are active at the same time, adhering to the chronological order instruction for concurrent events.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given rules perfectly:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The entire paragraph is dedicated to describing movement (\"move around,\" \"rotates,\" \"moves back and forth,\" \"moves along,\" \"circles\").\n*   **Chronological & Clear:** It presents the simultaneous actions clearly and logically.\n*   **Specific, Not Generic:** Instead of saying the chefs are \"working,\" it specifies they are \"picking up and preparing ingredients\" and \"gathering and preparing food items.\"\n*   **No Subjectivity or Speculation:** It avoids emotional adjectives (e.g., \"busily,\" \"skillfully\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems like\").\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Differentiates Subjects:** It effectively uses the hat colors to distinguish between the two chefs, as instructed.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The language is direct and objective, avoiding abstract interpretations like \"emphasizing their teamwork.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and focused entirely on the visible motion within the video.",
