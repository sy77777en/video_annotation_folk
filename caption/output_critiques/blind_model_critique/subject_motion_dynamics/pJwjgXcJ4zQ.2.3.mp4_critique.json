    "pre_caption": "The video shows a narrow street lined with various shops and restaurants, with orange traffic cones and barriers set up along the left side of the road. The camera moves forward, capturing a man in a dark coat and hat walking from the right side of the frame towards the left. As the camera continues to move, another man in a denim jacket and cap appears, walking towards the camera from the background. The street is busy with several people in the distance, and the shops have bright signs and advertisements displayed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the scene and the actions within it are plausible and likely accurate for a video of a busy street.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption identifies the camera's motion and the movements of two primary subjects in chronological order, which is good.\n*   It mentions other people in the background but does not describe their collective motion, which could be a minor omission if they are moving as a crowd.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has significant issues.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The first and last sentences of the caption are dedicated almost entirely to describing the static environment (\"narrow street lined with various shops,\" \"orange traffic cones,\" \"bright signs and advertisements\"). This detracts from the primary goal of describing movement and makes the caption unnecessarily wordy.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculative Statements\":** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The caption uses the phrase \"another man... **appears**,\" which directly violates this rule. Instead, it should describe *how* the man becomes visible (e.g., \"another man... walks into the frame from the background\").\n\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** Due to the heavy focus on static scene details, the caption is not concise. The core information about motion is diluted by environmental descriptions. A better caption would integrate the essential context into the action, for example: \"As the camera moves forward down a narrow street, a man in a dark coat walks from right to left across the frame.\"\n\n**In summary, the caption fails because it dedicates too much space to describing the static scene, violating the core instruction to focus on motion. It also uses the forbidden word \"appears,\" showing a clear disregard for the negative constraints.**",
