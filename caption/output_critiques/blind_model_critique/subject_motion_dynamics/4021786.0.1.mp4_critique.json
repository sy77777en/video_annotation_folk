    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows several kites soaring against a pale blue sky with wispy clouds. Two kites are red, and one is yellow, while the colors of the others are unclear; all are diamond-shaped and connected by thin strings. A hand, partially visible in the lower left, holds a blue or greyish-blue cylindrical kite reel with flanges and a handle, from which a string extends towards the kites, indicating a first-person perspective of someone flying them. The dark foliage of a tree is visible on the right edge of the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the primary subjects but could be more specific about their movements and interactions. The description of the kites' motion as \"soar and drift\" and \"sway gently\" is too general; in the video, the kites likely exhibit more distinct behaviors, such as a large delta kite holding a stable, high altitude while a smaller, diamond-shaped kite bobs and weaves more erratically below it. The description of the hand's action is also vague. Instead of just \"moves the reel\" and \"adjusting its position,\" the caption should specify the action, such as \"the hand rotates the reel's handle to let out more line.\" Crucially, the caption misses the opportunity to link the cause and effect between the hand and the kites. A more effective description would connect these actions, for example, by stating that as the hand lets out more line from the reel, the kites ascend higher and move further away in the sky, clarifying the relationship between the operator's input and the kites' resulting motion.",

A large delta kite maintains a stable, high altitude, while a smaller, diamond-shaped kite bobs and weaves erratically below it. As the hand releases more line, the kites ascend higher and drift further away in the sky, illustrating the dynamic interaction between the operator's actions and the kites' movements.",
