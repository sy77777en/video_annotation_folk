    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A white ocean liner, identified by red text as the \"RMS CARPATHIA,\" is shown from a high-angle perspective on a dark, grid-lined navigational chart. The chart's background is black with a white, marbled texture, resembling a dark, choppy sea. White text boxes display changing longitude and latitude coordinates, such as \"LONG: 49.98\" and \"LAT: 41.36.\" A glowing, dashed red line extends across the grid from a red dot in the upper left, indicating a path toward the ship's position. In the bottom left corner, a circular icon with a directional arrow is present.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately describes the basic animated elements, it misses the central narrative and key dynamic details of the video. The description of the ship moving \"steadily forward\" is an oversimplification; the video clearly shows the ship moving at a simulated high speed, indicated by a rapidly advancing on-screen clock, to convey the urgency of its journey. Most importantly, the caption fails to mention the destination of the ship's course. The glowing red line doesn't just exist in a void; it leads directly to a blinking red 'X' on the grid, labeled \"Titanic's Last Known Position.\" The caption describes the ship's movement in isolation, completely omitting the crucial context that it is moving *toward* a specific, marked point of interest. Additionally, the video shows the ship making a slight but distinct course correction to port as it navigates around a shaded blue area on the map labeled \"Ice Field,\" a critical maneuver that is entirely absent from the current description.",
