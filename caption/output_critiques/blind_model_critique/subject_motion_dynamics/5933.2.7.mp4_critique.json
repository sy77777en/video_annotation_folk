  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions. While it accurately describes a path of movement, its primary focus and inclusion of speculative language violate the core requirements.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video content matches the description, the caption is factually accurate in what it portrays (a person walking in a field).\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption describes both the environment and the subject's motion. However, it is not complete in the sense that it fails to prioritize the motion as instructed, giving far more detail to the static background.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **FAIL:** The caption does not focus on the subject's motion. The instructions state, \"If the video features salient human or non-human subjects, focus your description on their motion.\" The majority of the caption (the first three sentences) is dedicated to describing the static scenery (field, puddles, sky, trees). The subject's motion is only mentioned in the final sentence, making it an afterthought rather than the central focus.\n\n*   **FAIL:** The caption includes speculative statements. The instruction explicitly says to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The phrase \"...indicating a possible winter or early spring setting\" is a speculative interpretation based on the appearance of the trees, which is a direct violation of this rule.\n\n*   **PARTIAL FAIL:** The description of the action is not as specific as it could be. The instruction asks to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions (e.g., instead of ‘a person is running,’ say ‘a runner sprints across the finish line’).\" The caption uses the generic and passive phrase \"A person is seen walking.\" A more direct and active description, such as \"A person walks from right to center,\" would be better, though \"walking\" itself is a common and acceptable term.\n\n*   **PASS:** The caption correctly presents the action in chronological order (as it is a single, continuous movement). It also uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or abstract descriptions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person walks steadily from the right side of the frame towards the center, gradually moving further away from the camera. The scene is set in a vast, open field with patches of dry grass and small puddles of water scattered across the ground. The sky is partly cloudy, with a mix of white and gray clouds, and a line of leafless trees is visible in the background.",
