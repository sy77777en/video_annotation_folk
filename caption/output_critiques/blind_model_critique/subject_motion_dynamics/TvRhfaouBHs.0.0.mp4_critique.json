    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A cartoon boy with an atypically large and stylized hairstyle sits at a desk. His brown hair is sculpted into several large, rounded, cloud-like sections that form a voluminous bouffant. He has a light skin tone, large blue eyes with heavy eyelids, and eyebrows that are angled upwards toward the center. His mouth is slightly open and downturned. The boy is dressed in a white collared shirt and a green sweater vest. He rests his cheek on one hand while holding a yellow pencil in the other, looking down at a piece of paper on his desk. To the left, part of the side of another cartoon boy is visible; this boy is wearing the same white shirt and green sweater vest as the boy in the middle.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a static scene, identifying the subject (\"cartoon boy\"), his posture (\"remains seated,\" \"resting his cheek on one hand\"), and his interaction with objects (\"holding a pencil,\" \"looks down at the paper\").\n*   **Completeness:** It fully captures the essence of the video's content by establishing the static pose and then explicitly stating the lack of any action, which is the most critical \"motion\" detail in this case.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly follows the instruction for static subjects by stating, \"...does not display any noticeable movement throughout the video.\"\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is brief, clear, and written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. The description is purely factual and based on what is visible.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** This rule is not applicable as there is no sequence of actions, but the description is logically structured.\n    *   **Specificity:** It is specific about the subject's static pose rather than just saying \"a boy is sitting still.\"\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of how to apply the instructions to a video with no movement. It provides a clear, factual description of the static scene while adhering strictly to all the given rules.",
