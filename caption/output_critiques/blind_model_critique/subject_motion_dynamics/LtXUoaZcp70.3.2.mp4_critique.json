    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A 3D model of a man, rendered entirely in a shimmering, textured blue color, stands in a static pose. He is depicted wearing what appears to be a historical military uniform, consisting of a belted tunic, loose-fitting trousers, and tall boots. The man is standing at attention, with his head tilted up and to his left. His right hand rests near his waist, and his left arm is held behind his back.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies that the 3D model does not perform any large-scale actions like walking or gesturing, it is overly simplistic and potentially inaccurate. It completely fails to describe the primary motion in the video, which is the 360-degree turntable rotation of the virtual camera around the model, allowing the viewer to see it from all angles. The caption also omits the significant visual progression shown, where the model first appears as a wireframe, then is gradually filled with solid textures, and finally has dynamic lighting and shadows applied that move across its surface. Lastly, the assertion that the model is \"completely stationary\" is incorrect, as a subtle, continuous breathing animation is visible in the model's chest, which is a form of motion that should be described. A more effective caption would chronologically detail the camera's rotation and the model's visual transformation from wireframe to a fully rendered state, including the subtle breathing movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a 3D model of a man, initially appearing as a wireframe. As the virtual camera performs a 360-degree rotation around the model, viewers can observe its transformation: solid textures gradually fill in, followed by the application of dynamic lighting and shadows that move across its surface. Throughout the video, the model exhibits a subtle breathing animation, adding a touch of realism to its stationary pose.",
