    "pre_caption": "The camera begins to pan slowly from left to right, gradually revealing more of the large, metallic structure. The structure's surface remains consistent, with the intricate rows of raised letters and the horizontal bands of square indentations becoming more visible. The background appears to be a textured, blue-gray surface, possibly a wall or another large object, providing a contrasting backdrop to the metallic structure. As the camera continues to move, the details of the structure's surface, including the weathered texture and the reflective quality, become more apparent. The smaller, rectangular rod in the foreground remains in view, maintaining its position relative to the larger structure. The camera's movement is smooth and steady, ensuring that the intricate details of the structure are captured clearly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text. Avoid describing camera movement unless it is essential to understanding the shot.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A detailed view reveals a large, metallic structure with a silvery-white surface. Its surface is adorned with numerous small, raised elements that resemble letters, arranged in intricate rows and patterns, alongside horizontal bands featuring repeating square indentations. The metal exhibits a reflective quality with some areas showing a weathered or slightly corroded texture. In the foreground, a smaller, rectangular rod with rounded edges and a rough, somewhat corroded metallic surface partially obscures the larger structure. This object resembles a very old and special clock.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the chronological motion of the hand and the resulting reveal of the structure. However, it violates the instruction to avoid speculation by stating the background is \"possibly a wall or another large object.\" The description also dedicates excessive detail to the static appearance of the metallic structure, the background, and the foreground rod, which detracts from the primary focus on motion. Phrases describing the cinematography, such as \"The camera remains fixed\" and \"The camera's focus ensures that the intricate details... are captured clearly,\" are unnecessary and should be omitted to maintain focus on the subject's action. A more effective caption would more dynamically describe the revealing action itself—for instance, by noting the steady pace at which the hand sweeps across the frame to progressively uncover the textured surface. Finally, labeling the moving part as a \"clock's hand\" might be an assumption; if the video doesn't show a full clock face, a more neutral term like \"pointer\" or \"indicator\" would be more accurate.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera pans slowly from left to right, gradually uncovering more of the large metallic structure. The surface features intricate rows of raised letters and horizontal bands of square indentations, becoming more visible as the motion continues.

As the camera moves, the weathered texture and reflective quality of the structure's surface become apparent. A smaller rectangular rod remains in the foreground, maintaining its position relative to the larger structure.
