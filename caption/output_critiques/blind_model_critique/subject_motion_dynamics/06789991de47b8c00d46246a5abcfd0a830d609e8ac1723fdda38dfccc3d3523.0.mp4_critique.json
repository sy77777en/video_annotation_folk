    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two women engaged in preparing food. The woman in the center is wearing a white short-sleeved blouse with yellow patterns and a beige skirt with black patterns. She has her hair styled in a bun with straight bangs and appears to be relatively young. She is looking down at a bowl of noodles on the table. The woman on the right, partially visible, is wearing a blue top and has shoulder-length hair with straight bangs. She seems slightly older and is using chopsticks to add chili to the bowl of noodles. The scene conveys a collaborative cooking activity, with the focus on the preparation of the dish.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a specific, verifiable action: one woman using chopsticks to add an ingredient (sliced chili) to a bowl, and another woman observing. It avoids making assumptions about their relationship or the context beyond what is visually present.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete in its description of the primary motions. It captures the key interaction with the object (adding chili to noodles) and the main action of the secondary subject (looking at the bowl). It successfully focuses on the essential movements without including superfluous details.\n\n**Adherence to the given instruction:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is brief yet clearly explains what is happening.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented clearly. While they may be simultaneous, the description does not create a false sequence.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description centers on the actions \"uses chopsticks to add\" and \"looks down,\" perfectly aligning with the instruction to describe motion.\n*   **Specificity:** It is very specific, detailing not just that an object is being added, but what it is (\"sliced chili\"), how it's being added (\"uses chopsticks\"), and where it's being added (\"into the bowl of noodles\").\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely objective, free of emotional adjectives, speculation (\"appears to be\"), or abstract interpretations.\n*   **Clarity:** It uses simple, natural English and differentiates the subjects clearly by their position (\"on the right,\" \"in the center\").\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent descriptive unit without any extra formatting or introductory text.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and objective description of the video's content.",
