    "pre_caption": "The man picks up a telephone handset from the wall with his right hand and immediately hangs it back up. He then raises both hands to the top of the window frame and pulls the window down. Finally, he leans forward, resting his forearms on the lowered window frame, and looks slightly to his left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a mustache, dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark green vest with yellow trim, a green hat with red text on it, and matching green pants. He also wears a tie and a watch on his left wrist. The setting suggests a train environment, with visible elements like a map and communication equipment in the background.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption describes a sequence of specific, verifiable actions. It details which hand is used (\"right hand\"), the objects interacted with (\"telephone handset,\" \"window frame\"), and the final posture (\"resting his forearms... looks slightly to his left\"). Assuming this matches the video, it is highly accurate.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption covers three distinct phases of motion in a logical sequence, suggesting it captures the entire significant action within the video clip without leaving out key movements.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly follows all the given rules:\n    *   **Chronological Order:** It correctly uses sequential language (\"then,\" \"finally\") to present the actions in the order they occur: phone interaction, window interaction, and final resting position.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It exclusively describes the man's movements (\"picks up,\" \"hangs it back up,\" \"raises,\" \"pulls down,\" \"leans forward,\" \"resting,\" \"looks\"). It avoids describing his appearance or clothing.\n    *   **Specificity:** The actions are described with high specificity (e.g., \"picks up a telephone handset from the wall with his right hand\" instead of \"uses a phone\"; \"pulls the window down\" instead of \"closes the window\").\n    *   **Objectivity:** The description is factual and free of emotional (\"angrily\"), subjective (\"gracefully\"), or speculative (\"he seems to be\") language.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is easy to understand while being rich in detail.\n    *   **No Abstract Descriptions:** It avoids interpreting the meaning or style of the actions, sticking strictly to the physical movements.",
