    "pre_caption": "A hand with pink-painted nails holds a smartphone displaying a song titled 'KODAK ONHA' by a man with a beard and mustache. The hand moves towards the screen and taps the play button, initiating the song. The screen then changes to show a colorful graphic with the text 'SUMMER HITS' and various flowers and a cactus, along with an 'Add to Playlist' button. The hand interacts with the screen, indicating the addition to a playlist.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a close-up of a hand holding a smartphone. The hand has a medium to dark skin tone and is adorned with long, pink-painted nails. The person is wearing a light green sleeve. The smartphone screen initially displays an image of a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a hood, with the text \"KODAK ONHA\" and music player controls visible. Later, the screen shows a colorful graphic with the text \"SUMMER HITS,\" featuring flowers and a cactus, along with an \"Add to Playlist\" button. The hand interacts with the screen, indicating a change in the display.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily by focusing too much on static descriptions and using vague language for actions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the sequence of events: a hand holding a phone, tapping a play button, the screen changing, and a subsequent interaction to add the song to a playlist.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption covers the main sequence of events from beginning to end. However, it is not complete in its description of the *motion*. The final action is described as \"The hand interacts with the screen,\" which is too vague to be considered a complete description of the movement.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Focus on Motion (Major Fail):** The instruction states, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption begins with a long, static description: \"A hand with pink-painted nails holds a smartphone displaying a song titled 'KODAK ONHA' by a man with a beard and mustache.\" This entire sentence describes the scene before any motion occurs and should have been omitted.\n*   **Describe Individual Subject Actions with Clarity (Fail):** The instruction asks for specific actions (e.g., \"sprints across the finish line\") instead of generic ones (\"is running\"). The caption describes the final action as \"The hand interacts with the screen.\" This is a generic description. A better, more specific description would be \"The hand taps the 'Add to Playlist' button.\"\n*   **Avoid Abstract Descriptions (Minor Fail):** The phrase \"...indicating the addition to a playlist\" is an abstract interpretation of the action's result rather than a direct description of the physical motion itself. The instruction is to describe the motion clearly.\n*   **Chronological Order (Success):** The caption correctly presents the actions in the order they occur: the hand moves, it taps, the screen changes, the hand interacts again.\n*   **Conciseness (Fail):** Due to the inclusion of unnecessary static details at the beginning, the caption is not as concise as it could be.\n\n### Corrected Example:\n\nTo better follow the instructions, the caption should have been written like this:\n\nA hand moves toward a smartphone screen and taps a play button. The screen display changes, and the hand then taps an 'Add to Playlist' button.",
