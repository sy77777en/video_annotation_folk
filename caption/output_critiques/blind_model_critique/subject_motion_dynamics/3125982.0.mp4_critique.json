    "pre_caption": "The video shows a woman performing push-ups on a wooden floor. She is wearing a dark sports bra and bright pink shorts, with fingerless gloves on her hands. The background is a gym or exercise area with a polished wooden floor. The woman starts in a plank position, lowers her body towards the ground, and then pushes back up repeatedly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman engaged in a push-up exercise. She is wearing a dark sports bra and bright pink shorts, with fingerless gloves on her hands. Her skin tone is light, and her long hair is tied back. The focus is on her athletic posture, as she lowers and raises her body with her hands and feet supporting her movement. The scene emphasizes her physical activity and form.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption dedicates two full sentences to the woman's clothing (\"dark sports bra and bright pink shorts\"), accessories (\"fingerless gloves\"), and the background (\"gym or exercise area with a polished wooden floor\"). Since there is only one subject, these details are unnecessary and violate the core rules.\n\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** Because the caption includes extensive details about appearance and setting, it is not concise. The essential motion is only described in the final sentence, while the first three sentences contain information that should have been omitted.\n\n*   **Redundant Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is unnecessary introductory text. The description should begin directly with the subject's action.\n\nWhile the caption does correctly describe the motion in chronological order (\"starts in a plank position, lowers her body towards the ground, and then pushes back up repeatedly\"), its significant violations of the rules regarding focus and conciseness make it a poor example. A compliant caption would be a single, motion-focused sentence, such as: \"A woman, starting in a plank position on the floor, repeatedly lowers her body toward the ground and then pushes herself back up.\"",
