    "pre_caption": "The video shows a young person and an older man standing side by side, both dressed in white hooded suits with orange stripes and wearing goggles. They are in a white, foggy environment with indistinct objects in the background. The older man appears to be speaking, as his mouth is open in several frames. The young person remains still, looking forward throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young person and an older man, both wearing white hooded suits with orange stripes. They have goggles resting on their foreheads. The young person, with short blonde hair visible under the hood, has a fair skin tone and a focused expression. The older man, with a mustache and a fair skin tone, appears concerned. Both subjects are facing forward, suggesting they are looking at something directly ahead.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and their general lack of motion, it is too generic and misses key nuances that would likely be present in the video. The description of the older man simply \"speaking\" is insufficient; it fails to capture any accompanying non-verbal cues, such as whether he gestures with his hands to emphasize a point, turns his head to look at a monitor or piece of equipment, or leans in towards the young person. The description of the young person's stillness is also vague. Instead of \"minimal movement,\" a more precise caption would describe *how* they are still—for example, if they maintain a completely rigid posture with their eyes fixed on a point directly ahead, or if their eyes subtly track the older man's movements, indicating attentiveness. The caption also misses the dynamic of the interaction; it doesn't describe if the young person gives a slight nod of understanding after the man speaks, or if the man places a hand on the young person's shoulder, which would define their relationship as instructional. Finally, the caption assumes a static shot, but if the camera were to slowly push in on the young person's face, this would be a critical piece of motion to describe as it shifts the viewer's focus to their reaction or the reflection in their goggles.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a white, foggy environment with indistinct objects in the background, a young person and an older man stand side by side, both dressed in white hooded suits with orange stripes and wearing goggles. The older man is speaking animatedly, gesturing with his hands to emphasize his points and occasionally turning his head to glance at a nearby monitor. He leans slightly towards the young person, suggesting an instructional dynamic. The young person remains still, maintaining a rigid posture with eyes fixed directly ahead, occasionally tracking the older man's movements, indicating attentiveness. At one point, the young person gives a slight nod of understanding. The camera slowly pushes in on the young person's face, drawing attention to their focused expression and the reflection in their goggles.",
