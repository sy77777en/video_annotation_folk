    "pre_caption": "A hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text, floats over a snow-covered landscape. The drone moves closer to the balloon, focusing on its top as it drifts over the snowy terrain. The camera then transitions to an overhead view of the snowy landscape, showing winding paths and scattered trees. White subtitle text appears, providing location information: 'LEVI, Arctic Circle, Finland.'",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text, floating over a snow-covered landscape. As the drone moves closer, the balloon's top becomes the primary focus, eventually transitioning to an overhead view of the snowy terrain below. The ground is covered in snow with scattered trees, and white subtitle text appears, providing location information.**",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several core instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption appears to be an accurate, factual description of the visual events in the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description of the subject's motion is incomplete and lacks detail. Verbs like \"floats\" and \"drifts\" are used, but they are generic and don't provide specific information about the balloon's trajectory, speed, or changes in altitude, which would be essential for a motion-focused description.\n*   It is unclear if the balloon is still visible in the final overhead shot. If it is, its motion is not described, making the caption incomplete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the subject's motion\":** This is the most significant failure.\n    *   The caption dedicates the first sentence to the balloon's appearance (\"colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text\"), which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction: \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n    *   It describes the camera's movement (\"The drone moves closer to the balloon\") instead of the subject's movement relative to the frame. The focus should be on the balloon, not the camera.\n    *   It describes on-screen text (\"White subtitle text appears...\"), which is not subject motion.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Describe individual subject actions with clarity\":** The description of the balloon's movement is not specific. Instead of just \"floats,\" a better caption would describe *how* it floats (e.g., \"drifts from left to right,\" \"ascends slowly,\" \"maintains a steady altitude\").\n\n*   **Failure to Properly Describe Shot Transitions:** While it mentions a transition, it uses this to shift focus entirely to the landscape and away from the main subject. A correct caption would describe how the *subject's motion* is presented differently after the cut (e.g., \"After a cut to an overhead view, the balloon continues to drift over the landscape\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The hot air balloon gently ascends and drifts from left to right over the snow-covered landscape, maintaining a steady altitude. As the drone approaches, the focus remains on the balloon's top, capturing its gradual movement across the snowy terrain. In the final overhead shot, the balloon continues its serene journey, gliding over winding paths and scattered trees in the Arctic Circle, Finland.",
