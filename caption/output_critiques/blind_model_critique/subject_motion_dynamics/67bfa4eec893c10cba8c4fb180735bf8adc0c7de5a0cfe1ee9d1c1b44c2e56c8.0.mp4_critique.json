    "pre_caption": "The video shows a person lying on a sofa, with their feet prominently positioned closer to the camera, adorned with shiny sprinkles. The feet move slightly, with toes wiggling and the feet shifting positions. The background includes a blurred view of plants and a window, suggesting an indoor setting. The person remains mostly still, with only their feet showing noticeable movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person lying on a sofa, with their feet prominently positioned closer to the camera. The feet are adorned with shiny sprinkles, capturing the viewer's attention due to the shallow focus that blurs the rest of the body. The person appears relaxed, with their head resting farther away, creating a sense of depth. The composition divides the frame, with the lower half occupied by the person on the sofa and the upper half consisting of empty space, enhancing the focus on the feet.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption correctly identifies the subject and the general movement, but it lacks the specific, chronological detail requested in the instructions. The description of the motion as \"feet move slightly, with toes wiggling and the feet shifting positions\" is too generic. In the video I watched, the motion was more distinct and sequential: first, the person's right foot slowly rotates outward at the ankle, then the toes on both feet curl tightly before slowly uncurling. This sequence is a key aspect of the motion that the caption misses. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the interaction between the movement and the sprinkles; as the toes curl, the sprinkles on the knuckles catch the light and create a shimmering effect, and a few loose sprinkles are dislodged and fall onto the sofa fabric. A better description would chronologically detail these specific actions and their effect on the sprinkles, providing a much clearer picture of the video's content while omitting the static details about the person's position and the background.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a sequence of movements focusing on a person's feet adorned with shiny sprinkles. Initially, the right foot slowly rotates outward at the ankle. Following this, the toes on both feet curl tightly, causing the sprinkles on the knuckles to catch the light and create a shimmering effect. As the toes gradually uncurl, a few loose sprinkles are dislodged and fall onto the sofa fabric, adding a dynamic element to the scene.",
