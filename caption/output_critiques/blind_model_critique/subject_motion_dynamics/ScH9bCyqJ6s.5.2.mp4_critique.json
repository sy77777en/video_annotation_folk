    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A pair of light-skinned hands holds a small, intricate electronic component. The component consists of two metal plates connected by a black plastic frame. One metal plate has a small, etched QR code and a grid of circular perforations on one side. Through cutouts in the second metal plate, a small blue square component and a silver-colored square component with a white center are visible. The hands are holding the object between their thumbs and index fingers, with the right thumb partially covering the perforated section of the first metal plate.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as \"a pair of hands\" and the object as \"a small electronic component.\" The described motion—the right thumb sliding to the right to uncover a specific feature (\"a grid of circular perforations\")—is a precise and plausible action for this type of subject matter.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It describes the entire sequence of events in a logical, chronological order. It begins with the initial static state (\"holds... steady\") and proceeds to the main action (\"slides to the right\") and its direct consequence (\"uncovering a grid...\"). It captures all the essential motion without leaving out key details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the chronological flow of actions, using the word \"then\" to clearly mark the sequence.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on the subject's motion (\"holds steady,\" \"slides\") and the effect of that motion, rather than on the appearance of the component.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct, creating a clear and concise paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It is strictly objective, avoiding any emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Specificity:** It excels in specificity. Instead of a generic \"moves a part,\" it details that the \"right thumb... slides to the right,\" and it specifies the effect of this action is \"uncovering a grid of circular perforations on the metal plate,\" which aligns perfectly with the instruction to describe the effect of an interaction.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The description is concrete and avoids any abstract interpretations of the movement.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and highly effective.",
