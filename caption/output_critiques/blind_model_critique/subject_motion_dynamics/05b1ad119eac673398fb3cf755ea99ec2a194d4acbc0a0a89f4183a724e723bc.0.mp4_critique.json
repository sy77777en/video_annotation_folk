  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is not good. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is likely an accurate description of the visual content in the video (a rocky shore with waves).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption describes the primary motion of the waves crashing. However, it dedicates a significant portion of its length to static, non-moving elements, which detracts from the focus on motion.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several key instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the subject's motion\":** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption spends too much time describing the static scenery (\"a rocky beach with large boulders,\" \"a distant view of mountains under a partly cloudy sky\") instead of focusing purely on the movement of the waves.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Avoid abstract descriptions\":** The caption ends with \"...creating a dynamic and lively scene.\" The words \"dynamic\" and \"lively\" are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text\":** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is a forbidden introductory phrase.\n*   **Violation of \"Describe individual subject actions with clarity\":** While it mentions the motion, using a passive construction like \"waves are seen crashing\" is weaker than a more direct, active description such as \"Ocean waves crash against large rocks...\"\n\nA better caption that adheres to the rules would be:\n\n\"Ocean waves roll in from the right and crash against large rocks along the shore, sending splashes of white water into the air.\"",
