    "pre_caption": "A black sports car with 'NOS' branding is seen drifting on a track, producing a large cloud of white smoke from its tires as it maneuvers through a turn. The car continues to drift, maintaining its speed and trajectory, with the smoke trail following closely behind. The car's movement is smooth and controlled, demonstrating its drifting skills on the track. The background shows a barren, desert-like landscape with a clear sky, and the track appears to be a wide, open area suitable for drifting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including a large \"NOS\" logo on the side. The car has a sleek, aerodynamic design with visible modifications, such as a rear spoiler and racing decals. It is producing a significant amount of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed drifting. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail emphasize its speed and agility. The vehicle's orientation changes, showcasing its drifting capability on a wide, open track.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main action but includes subjective analysis and lacks specific chronological detail. Phrases like \"smooth and controlled\" and \"demonstrating its drifting skills\" are interpretive and should be replaced with objective descriptions of the car's physical motion. The description of the motion is also too general; it doesn't break down the maneuver into its distinct phases. For instance, the video likely shows the car first initiating the drift by turning in and breaking traction, then holding a specific angle sideways through the apex of the turn with its front wheels pointed opposite the curve, and finally straightening out as it exits the turn to regain grip and accelerate. The caption also uses the speculative phrase \"appears to be\" when describing the track, which should be avoided. A more effective description would focus entirely on the car's sequence of movements, detailing how it enters the slide, maintains its angle, and exits the turn, while omitting the subjective praise and background speculation.",
