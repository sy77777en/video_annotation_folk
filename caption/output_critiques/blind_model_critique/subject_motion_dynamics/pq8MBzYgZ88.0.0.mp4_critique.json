    "pre_caption": "A woman in a white lab coat walks steadily toward the camera, pushing a wheeled metal cart down a long hallway. As she proceeds, she passes a reception area where another woman in a nurse's uniform is seated at a desk. The woman in the lab coat then enters a hospital room, continuing to push the cart forward. Inside the room, a man in a dark uniform, who is sitting in a chair and reading, looks up as she enters.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a woman with dark, styled hair wearing a purple headscarf or headband and an orange crew-neck dress under a white lab coat, paired with dark heels. She is walking directly toward the camera while pushing a two-tiered, wheeled metal cart that holds electronic equipment on the top shelf and a clipboard on the bottom. As she proceeds down a hallway, a second woman in a light-colored nurse's uniform and cap enters the frame from the left foreground and gradually shifts to the background as the camera moves. The main subject then enters a room where a man in a dark uniform is sitting in a chair with his legs crossed, reading a document. He looks up as she enters and greets her.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly follows a chronological order, it misses key details about the interactions and the nature of the movement. For instance, stating the woman \"enters a hospital room\" is too general; the video likely shows her pausing to push the door open with her free hand before maneuvering the cart through the doorway, an important part of the motion sequence. The description of the secondary characters is also static; the nurse at the reception desk is probably not just \"seated\" but actively working, perhaps typing on a keyboard and only briefly glancing up as the main subject passes. Similarly, describing the man as simply \"look[ing] up\" is vague. The video likely shows him lowering the book or clipboard he was reading onto his lap and turning his body to face the woman, indicating a more deliberate shift in attention. Finally, the caption ends abruptly. A more complete description would include the woman's final action, such as bringing the cart to a stop beside the man's chair and turning to address him, which would conclude the primary motion arc of the scene.",
