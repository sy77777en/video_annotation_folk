    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a dark forest at night, a person stands still between several trees. The individual wears a white cap, a light-colored hooded jacket with a dark blue hood, and dark pants. They are seen from behind, facing away from the viewer and looking deeper into the woods.**",

  "generated_critique": "This caption correctly identifies the subject's lack of significant motion, but its description is too absolute and misses key details that would enhance its accuracy. The claim that the person is \"completely still\" and exhibits \"no discernible movement\" is likely an overstatement, as the video might show subtle but important actions like the rise and fall of their chest from breathing, a slight shift in weight, or their hair and clothing moving in the wind. The caption also fails to describe the surrounding environment's motion, such as leaves rustling or fog rolling through the forest, which would create a powerful contrast with the subject's stillness. A more effective description would replace the redundant phrasing with specific details about the person's posture (e.g., \"stands rigidly, facing away from the camera\") and incorporate the environmental motion to provide a more complete and dynamic picture of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The person stands rigidly in the dark forest, facing away from the camera, with only subtle movements like the gentle rise and fall of their chest and slight shifts in weight. Their hair and clothing sway slightly in the breeze, while the surrounding environment adds contrast with leaves rustling and fog rolling through the trees.",
