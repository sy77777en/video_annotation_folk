    "pre_caption": "A man on a scooter rides toward a small wooden ramp and launches into the air over another man lying on the ground. While airborne, he holds onto the handlebars and performs a complete front flip, tucking his body as he and the scooter rotate forward together. He then lands back on the concrete on both wheels and rolls away. In the background, a third man stands still, holding a phone up to record the stunt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a man performing a stunt on a scooter in a parking garage. He wears a black helmet with white lettering, a black short-sleeved t-shirt, light-colored pants, and bright turquoise sneakers. His scooter has a gold-colored frame, red handlebar grips, and turquoise wheels. The man rides toward a small wooden ramp and launches into the air, performing a front flip while holding onto the scooter. He performs this trick over another man who is lying face-up on the ground at the end of the ramp, wearing blue jeans and dark boots. In the middle ground, a third man stands near a silver pickup truck, holding up a phone as if to record the stunt.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of the stunt, but it could be more specific about the dynamics of the motion. For instance, it states the man \"rides toward\" the ramp, but it omits that he first pushes off several times with his foot to gain significant speed for the jump. The description of the front flip is good, but it could be enhanced by noting that he pulls the handlebars tightly toward his waist to initiate and control the rotation. While the caption correctly states he lands on both wheels, it misses the crucial detail that he bends his knees deeply to absorb the impact before straightening up. Finally, \"rolls away\" is a bit vague; the video shows him rolling for a few feet before making a sharp turn to face the camera and raising one hand in a celebratory gesture. Additionally, while the man on the ground is indeed lying down, the caption could emphasize his complete stillness throughout the stunt, which contrasts with the rider's dynamic movement.",
