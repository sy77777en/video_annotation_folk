    "pre_caption": "The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, standing in front of a background with a grid of windows. A group of colorful fish begins to swim from the left side of the frame towards the right, gradually moving closer to the subjects. The fish continue to swim past the subjects, creating a dynamic scene as they move across the frame. The fish eventually swim out of the frame, leaving the subjects still standing and watching.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera. The subject on the right, occupying the full frame height, appears to be a woman standing upright with her hands on her hips. The central subject, approximately 40% of the frame height, seems to be a child wearing a hooded outfit. Both figures are positioned facing away from the viewer, observing a group of colorful fish swimming in front of them. The fish vary in size and color, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The setting suggests an aquarium environment, with the subjects appearing to move upward, possibly because the platform they are on is ascending, as they watch the aquatic life.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has several areas where it fails to adhere to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to accurately describe a plausible video scene. The sequence of events—fish entering, passing static figures, and exiting—is logical and described in a clear, chronological order.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It establishes the initial scene, describes the entire motion path of the primary subjects (the fish) from their entrance to their exit, and notes the state of the secondary subjects (the humans) throughout the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has several issues:\n\n*   **Good:** It correctly follows the **chronological order** of events.\n*   **Good:** It focuses on the **motion** of the fish (\"swim from the left... towards the right,\" \"moving closer,\" \"swim past,\" \"swim out of the frame\") and the lack of motion in the humans (\"standing\").\n*   **Violation:** The caption includes speculative language. The phrase \"**and watching**\" is an assumption about the subjects' actions. Since their backs are to the camera, it is impossible to confirm they are watching. The instructions state: \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and \"Avoid speculative statements.\"\n*   **Violation:** It uses a subjective and abstract description. The phrase \"**creating a dynamic scene**\" is an interpretation of the video's mood and is not a factual description of motion. The instructions state: \"Avoid abstract descriptions\" and \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Violation:** It includes an unnecessary introductory phrase. \"**The video shows...**\" is redundant and violates the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown or introductory text.\"\n*   **Violation:** It includes a detail about appearance that is not essential for the description of motion. The word \"**colorful**\" describes the fish's appearance, which the instructions advise against unless needed to differentiate between subjects.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption successfully captures the chronological flow and core movements in the video. However, it fails to be strictly objective and concise by including a speculative action (\"watching\"), a subjective phrase (\"dynamic scene\"), and unnecessary introductory text.\n\nA revised caption that strictly follows all instructions would look like this:\n\n**Two human-shaped subjects stand with their backs to the camera. A group of fish swims into the frame from the left, moves towards the right past the subjects, and then swims out of the frame. The two subjects remain stationary throughout the video.**",
