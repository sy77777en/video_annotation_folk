    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a dark map, highlighting the location of Washington with an orange circle and the text 'WASHINGTON' in orange.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a dark, detailed map with highlighted elements. A prominent orange circle marks \"Washington,\" while a blue circle indicates the \"Flight 93 Crash Site.\" Blue lines connect these points, suggesting a route or path. The map's intricate lines and textures provide a geographical context, emphasizing the locations' significance. The overall visual is focused on these key points and their connection.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the visual elements (map, circles, text, line) and their specific labels and colors. It precisely describes the sequence of events as they would appear in an animated graphic.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete, covering the entire sequence from the initial state to the final camera movement. It doesn't miss any key actions like the appearance of the circles, the extension of the line, or the camera zoom.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in perfect chronological order: the initial view, the appearance of the second location, the drawing of the line, and the final zoom-out.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption successfully describes the \"motion\" of the graphical elements, which are the subjects in this context. It uses active, specific verbs like \"appears,\" \"extends,\" and \"zooms out\" to describe how the visual information is presented over time.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and to the point. It avoids jargon and creates a coherent paragraph that is easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely objective. It avoids emotional language, speculation (\"appears to be\"), and abstract descriptions (\"emphasizing the distance\").\n    *   **Specificity:** It is specific about what is happening. Instead of \"graphics are shown,\" it details that a circle \"appears,\" a line \"extends,\" and the camera \"zooms out.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the instructions to an animated graphic. It correctly interprets the graphical elements as the \"subjects\" and their animations as \"motion,\" resulting in a clear, factual, and well-structured description.",
