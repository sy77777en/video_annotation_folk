    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, with the camera slowly moving forward, gradually revealing more of the scene. As the camera progresses, the legs and feet of a person wearing a brown jacket, beige pants, and dark green rubber boots become visible, walking through the grass. The person continues to walk forward, with the camera following their movement, capturing the dense grass and the person's steady pace. The video concludes with the person still walking through the grass, with the camera maintaining a close-up view of their lower body and the surrounding vegetation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video reveals a person standing in a field of tall, dry grass. The individual is wearing a brown jacket and beige pants, complemented by dark green rubber boots. The person is facing away, with their lower body visible among the dense grass, which is a prominent feature throughout the scene. The video begins with the view initially obscured by the tall grass, gradually revealing the subject as the camera or subject moves, focusing on the interaction between the person and the natural environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good overall but has one significant flaw regarding the level of detail in the subject's appearance. It successfully follows most of the key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes the sequence of events: a camera moving through grass, revealing a person's legs, and then following them as they walk. The description of the camera's perspective (close-up, following the lower body) and the subject's action (walking at a steady pace) is correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is complete, covering the video from its beginning to its conclusion. It chronologically outlines the camera's initial movement, the subject's appearance, their continuous motion, and the final state of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, chronological sequence (\"begins with,\" \"As the camera progresses,\" \"continues to,\" \"concludes with\").\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It effectively describes the motion of both the camera (\"slowly moving forward,\" \"following their movement\") and the subject (\"walking through the grass,\" \"continues to walk forward,\" \"steady pace\").\n    *   **Clarity and Objectivity:** The language is simple, natural, and free of emotional, subjective, or speculative words.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Unnecessary Appearance Details:** The main violation of the instructions is the inclusion of \"wearing a brown jacket, beige pants, and dark green rubber boots.\" The instructions state: \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Since there is only one person, these details are superfluous and detract from the primary focus on motion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written and adheres to most rules, particularly regarding chronological structure and objective motion description. However, it fails to follow the negative constraint of avoiding unnecessary appearance details, which is a key part of the instructions. To be fully compliant, the description of the person's clothing should be removed.",
