    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A reddish-brown woolly monkey is shown in profile, facing toward the right. The primate has thick, dense fur that is a coppery-brown color on its back and shoulders, while its head, face, and hands are covered in black fur. Initially, the monkey sits with its mouth chewing, tilting its head slightly upwards. It then lowers its head to examine a small, light-colored piece of food held in its hand before placing the food in its mouth.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective and adheres to the instructions:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption accurately describes a clear sequence of actions. It captures the main movements of the subject—chewing, lowering its head, interacting with food, and eating—providing a complete picture of the activity in the video.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption follows this rule perfectly. It presents the actions in the exact order they occur: the monkey is first \"chewing,\" \"then lowers its head,\" \"examines\" the food, and finally \"brings the food to its mouth.\"\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on the subject's movements and actions (\"sits,\" \"chewing,\" \"tilted up,\" \"lowers its head,\" \"examines,\" \"brings\"). It avoids static descriptions of the monkey's appearance.\n\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. The single sentence is coherent and easy to understand, efficiently conveying the necessary information without extra words.\n\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is free of emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"happily,\" \"curiously\") and avoids speculative phrases (\"it seems to,\" \"it might be\"). It states only what is visibly happening.\n\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs to describe the actions. Instead of a generic \"the monkey eats,\" it details the process: \"chewing,\" \"examines a small piece of food in its hand,\" and \"brings the food to its mouth.\" This provides a much clearer and more informative description of the interaction.",
