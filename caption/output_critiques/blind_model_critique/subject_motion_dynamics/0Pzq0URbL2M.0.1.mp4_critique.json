    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man in a white lab coat standing at a counter in a laboratory, with his back to the camera. The laboratory has tiled walls, a clock on the wall, and various scientific equipment on the counter and shelves. The man remains in the same position throughout the frames, indicating he is focused on his task. The camera gradually moves away from the man, revealing more of the laboratory environment, including additional equipment and furniture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a laboratory setting. He is wearing a white lab coat, black pants, and black shoes, and has short hair. The man is standing at a counter, facing away, and appears to be engaged in a task involving laboratory equipment. The room contains various scientific instruments and furniture, including a row of metal cabinets and a desk. The overall setting suggests a scientific or medical environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately notes the camera's gradual backward movement, but it misrepresents the subject's action by stating he \"remains in the same position.\" While the man's overall location in the frame is static, I can see his hands are actively engaged in a task; he is holding a glass beaker in his left hand and using his right hand to stir its contents with a glass rod. This specific, continuous stirring motion is the central action of the subject and should be the focus of the description. The statement \"indicating he is focused on his task\" is an unnecessary and speculative interpretation of his mental state, which should be omitted in favor of describing the observable physical action of stirring the beaker's contents. The critique is that the caption misses the primary subject motion entirely and instead offers a vague generalization and a subjective inference.",
