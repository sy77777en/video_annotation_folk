    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a man in a pilot's uniform, smiling and looking directly at the camera. The background includes a blurred image of an airport terminal and a detailed view of an aircraft cockpit with various instruments and controls. As the camera moves downward, the image of the airplane becomes more prominent, revealing the KLM logo and the text 'The reliable airline of those surprising Dutch.' The final frames fully integrate the airplane image with the pilot, creating a cohesive and visually appealing advertisement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video presents a digitally crafted composition resembling a magazine layout, featuring a man in a pilot's uniform with a white shirt and black epaulets with gold stripes, smiling and facing the camera. He has light skin and gray hair, and is positioned near an aircraft cockpit with visible dials and controls. Adjacent to him is an artfully integrated image of a large airplane, predominantly teal with a white underbelly, displaying the KLM logo and the text \"The reliable airline of those surprising Dutch.\" The scene creatively blends elements of aviation and advertising, with the pilot and the aircraft as central subjects.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it correctly presents the events in chronological order, it includes subjective interpretations, focuses excessively on static details, and describes the video's purpose rather than just its content.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   The caption appears to accurately describe the visual sequence of a video, likely an advertisement. It correctly identifies the subjects (pilot, airplane image) and the sequence of events (close-up, camera move, reveal).\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The caption covers the entire sequence from beginning to end. However, it is incomplete in its primary task, which is to describe motion. It dedicates significant space to describing static elements (the pilot's uniform, the background, cockpit details) rather than focusing on the movement itself.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates the following instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption spends the first two sentences describing the static appearance of the pilot and the background, which is contrary to the instructions. The primary motion described is the camera's movement, not the subject's.\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses the phrase \"visually appealing,\" which is a subjective judgment.\n*   **Avoid Abstract Descriptions:** The final sentence, \"The final frames fully integrate the airplane image with the pilot, creating a cohesive and visually appealing advertisement,\" is an abstract interpretation of the video's effect and purpose. The instruction explicitly warns against this.\n*   **Describe Content Only:** By identifying the video as an \"advertisement,\" the caption describes the video's genre or purpose, which is an interpretation that goes beyond describing the visible content.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description of static elements makes the caption less concise than it could be. A better caption would focus only on the pilot's minimal action and the motion of the reveal.\n\n**In summary, the caption fails because it acts more like a marketing analysis than an objective description of motion. It includes subjective language, abstract interpretations, and excessive detail on static elements, all of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions.**",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video starts with a close-up of a pilot in uniform, looking directly at the camera. The camera then moves downward, gradually revealing the airplane with the KLM logo. The sequence highlights the transition from the pilot to the airplane, emphasizing the motion and connection between the two.",
