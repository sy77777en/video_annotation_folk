    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens on a long, white, cylindrical object suspended horizontally on a thin cable that stretches across a paved area. In the middle ground to the right, a yellow metal structure, which appears to be a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys, is positioned next to a tall black barrier and moves leftward. The handheld camera unsteadily moves left, dynamically tracking a large yellow metal frame connected to a cable system, while slightly panning left. The camera then shifts focus to a close-up of a different part of the apparatus. This new view shows a light-colored vertical post supporting a sloped metal channel, within which a black spherical object is rolling downward. A black cable is also visible, attached to the side of the post with a silver carabiner.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two primary motions in the video: the camera movement (\"tilts upward and pans to the left\") and the subject's motion (\"a thick gray strap... rapidly travels upward and over a black pulley wheel\"). The description of the objects and their direction of movement is precise and matches what would be seen in such a video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It covers the entire sequence of action from the initial reframing of the shot to the primary mechanical movement. It successfully establishes the context with the camera motion and then focuses on the key action of the pulley system, leaving no significant motion undescribed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption is excellent and adheres to all instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence, first describing the camera movement that changes the view, and then describing the motion of the strap that happens as the camera moves.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The entire caption is dedicated to describing motion, both of the camera and the subject, without getting sidetracked by static descriptions.\n*   **Specificity and Clarity:** It uses clear and specific language. Instead of \"the pulley moves,\" it details that a \"strap... rapidly travels upward and over a black pulley wheel.\" This clearly describes the interaction between the components.\n*   **Conciseness and Natural Language:** The description is concise, informative, and written in simple, natural English, making it easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely objective. It avoids emotional adjectives, speculative language (\"appears to be,\" \"might be\"), and abstract interpretations (\"emphasizing its power\"). The word \"rapidly\" is an objective descriptor of speed, not a subjective judgment.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is exceptionally good. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, clear, concise, and strictly focused on the subject's motion in chronological order.",
