    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young Black man with short, black hair styled in a high-top fade is seen from a low angle. He wears a denim varsity-style jacket with a striped collar and cuffs over a white collared shirt. His face, illuminated by a warm light from his left side, has a focused and serious expression as he looks down at a small, rectangular object, possibly a ticket or card, that he holds in his hands.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject, the low camera angle, and the general focus of the action. However, it is too vague and misses opportunities to describe the motion with greater precision. The phrase \"small, rectangular objects\" is generic; the video likely shows what these objects are, such as dominoes, tarot cards, or small wooden blocks, and specifying this would add valuable context. The description of the movement—\"moves the object in his right hand slightly upward while examining it\"—lacks detail. A more effective description would specify *how* he examines it. For instance, the video might show him using his thumb and forefinger to rotate the object, flip it over to see the other side, or slide it out from a stack held in his other hand. Clarifying the initial arrangement of the objects (e.g., are they held in his left hand, or is he picking one up from a pile on a table?) and then describing the specific manipulation would create a much clearer and more informative chronological account of the action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A young man, viewed from a low angle, holds two small dominoes in his hands. He keeps his head and gaze lowered, focusing intently on the dominoes. In his left hand, he holds a stack of dominoes, while with his right hand, he uses his thumb and forefinger to rotate a single domino, flipping it over to examine the other side. He then slides it out from the stack, carefully inspecting its dots and edges.",
