    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A sandy-yellow, weathered airplane with visible rivets along its seams is shown in a close-up view of its cockpit. The word \"RESCUE\" is stenciled in black capital letters below the side window. Inside the cockpit, a woman with dark skin and short, dark, curly hair is seated in the pilot's position. She is wearing a dark tank top, and her upper body is visible as she sits sideways, looking down towards the window beside the cockpit on her left.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. While the caption correctly identifies the chronological order of the woman's actions and the camera's general path, it could be more precise and use standard aviation terminology. The term \"steering wheel\" is inaccurate; the control is a \"yoke\" or \"control column,\" and using the correct term would improve the description's authority. The description of the camera movement is slightly confusing; it's unclear how it can be \"around the woman\" while also being on the \"exterior of the airplane's cockpit.\" A more likely visual would be the camera starting on the exterior, then passing through the canopy glass to focus on the pilot. Furthermore, the caption could add more specific detail about the action; for instance, after she looks down and left, she likely grips the yoke with both hands and rotates it counterclockwise. The statement that turning the yoke \"causes... her own body to tilt\" is misleading; her body tilts passively because she is seated within the banking aircraft, not as a direct result of her turning the yoke. A more accurate description would state that as she rotates the yoke, the aircraft banks to the left, and she and the cockpit interior tilt along with it. Finally, mentioning the visual context, such as clouds passing by the window to confirm the plane is airborne, would add a crucial detail about the motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera begins outside the airplane's cockpit, panning from right to left and passing through the canopy glass to focus on the pilot. Inside, a woman sits in the pilot's seat, initially still, looking down and to her left. She then grips the yoke with both hands and rotates it counterclockwise. As the aircraft banks to the left, her body and the cockpit interior tilt along with it. Through the window, clouds can be seen passing by, confirming the plane is airborne.",
