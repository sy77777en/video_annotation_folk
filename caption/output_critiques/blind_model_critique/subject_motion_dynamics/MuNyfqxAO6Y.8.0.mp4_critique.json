    "pre_caption": "The video features a black two-door coupe parked on an asphalt surface, with the camera gradually moving from a close-up to a wider shot. The car is equipped with a prominent rear spoiler and distinctive silver-colored wheels with a five-pointed star design and a polished outer lip. Through the tinted rear side window, a portion of an interior roll cage is visible. The car casts a long shadow to its right, indicating a low sun angle, with a bright sun glare visible near the top of the frame. In the background, a body of water is present on the right, bordered by an area of dry, tall, reddish-brown grass, likely a wheat field, under a partly cloudy sky. Behind this field, a taller field, possibly a wheat field, is visible. On the left side of the frame, behind the tall, reddish-brown wheat field, there are some houses visible, with only the eaves in view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a black two-door coupe, likely a modified sports car, parked on an asphalt surface. The car is viewed from the rear three-quarter perspective, showcasing its sleek, lowered profile. It is equipped with a prominent rear spoiler and distinctive silver-colored wheels with a five-pointed star design and a polished outer lip. Through the tinted rear side window, a portion of an interior roll cage is visible. The car casts a long shadow to its right, indicating a low sun angle, with a bright sun glare visible near the top of the frame. In the background, a body of water is present on the right, bordered by an area of dry, tall, reddish-brown grass, likely a wheat field, under a partly cloudy sky. Behind this field, a taller field, possibly a wheat field, is visible. On the left side of the frame, behind the tall, reddish-brown wheat field, there are some houses visible, with only the eaves in view.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly states the car is parked; the video actually shows the black coupe in motion, driving forward along the asphalt road. The wheels are visibly spinning, and the background scenery, including the body of water and fields, scrolls past from right to left, which clearly indicates the car's forward movement. The description focuses excessively on static details like the wheel design and the visible roll cage while completely omitting the primary action of the subject. While the camera does move backward to reveal a full shot, the most significant motion is the car itself driving, which should be the central point of the description. The mention of the stream's flow is a minor detail that distracts from the main subject's more prominent action.",
