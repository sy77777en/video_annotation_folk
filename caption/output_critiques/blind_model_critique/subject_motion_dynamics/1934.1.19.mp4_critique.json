    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person dressed in a full-body white suit, including a helmet and gloves, standing on a dark platform. The individual appears to be male, with a light skin tone visible on the face. The suit is form-fitting, and the person stands upright, facing forward. The setting is minimalistic, with the person being the central focus against a dark background.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good but contains one significant flaw that violates a key instruction.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nAssuming the video shows a person in a white suit turning and then speaking, the description of the events is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully covers the entire sequence of motion from start to finish, describing the full 360-degree turn and the subsequent action.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at presenting the actions in a clear, chronological sequence (\"begins by...\", \"then...\", \"continue to turn...\", \"and then...\").\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly focuses on the subject's movement (turning, facing different directions) rather than static appearance.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, direct, and easy to understand, creating a coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or abstract descriptions.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Avoids Speculative Language:** The caption violates the rule: \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The phrase \"**appears to be speaking**\" introduces uncertainty. If the person's mouth is moving in a speaking motion, it should be stated directly as \"and then speaks\" or \"moves their mouth while facing forward.\" The use of \"appears\" is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-structured, chronological, and focused on motion. However, its use of the speculative phrase \"appears to be speaking\" is a direct violation of the instructions. To be fully compliant, this phrase should be replaced with a definitive description of the visible action.",
