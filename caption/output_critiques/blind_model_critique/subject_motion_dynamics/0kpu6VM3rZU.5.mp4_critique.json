    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two women are featured in the foreground at what appears to be a red carpet event. The woman on the right has brown skin, long, straight, slicked-back black hair, and is wearing a metallic gold spaghetti strap top with a V-neckline. She has large gold multi-loop earrings and a tattoo on her left shoulder. She is speaking to the woman on her right. The second woman, the interviewer, has lighter skin and long brown hair styled in a high ponytail. She wears a beige dress with intricate, sheer, lacy detailing around the neckline and shoulders, along with long, dangling silver earrings. She holds a black microphone with a white and gold \"ET CANADA\" logo toward the first woman. In the background, a bald man with a short beard, wearing a dark suit and tie, stands behind the woman in beige. Other people are visible in the background, including a man wearing a black beanie hat.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subjects and the basic interaction, but it describes a static scene rather than a sequence of movements as requested. A video would likely show a more dynamic flow of action. For instance, the caption could specify the initial motion, such as the interviewer extending the microphone toward the woman, who then leans in to speak. The description of the woman's action, \"speaks into it,\" is too general; it could be improved by describing *how* she speaks—perhaps she gestures with her free hand for emphasis or smiles while answering. Similarly, the interviewer's action of \"turning her head slightly\" is vague and could be more specific, such as \"nods affirmatively as she listens.\" The background motion is described as people \"mov[ing] around slowly,\" which is generic; a more detailed description might note the intermittent flicker of camera flashes from photographers or people turning to watch the interview, adding more specific visual context. A stronger caption would narrate the brief, chronological progression of the interview exchange.",
