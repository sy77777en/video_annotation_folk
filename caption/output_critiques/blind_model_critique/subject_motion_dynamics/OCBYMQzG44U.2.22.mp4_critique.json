This motion slowly reveals the full extent of the surreal and empty environment.\n\nThe scene is a long, narrow, enclosed space, like a corridor or channel, filled with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in small, off-white or pale green tiles, creating a sterile and monotonous texture. Rows of bright, square lights are embedded in the ceiling, casting a stark, slightly greenish glow that reflects off the tiled surfaces and the water. At the far end of the corridor, a doorway and what appear to be steps leading out of the water are visible, adding to the liminal and slightly unsettling atmosphere of the location.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the primary camera motion—a pull-back and upward tilt—and accurately places it at the beginning of the description. However, it violates several key instructions. The description is saturated with subjective and interpretive language such as \"surreal,\" \"sterile,\" \"monotonous,\" \"liminal,\" and \"unsettling,\" which the instructions explicitly forbid. It also uses the speculative phrase \"what appear to be steps,\" which should be avoided. While the caption mentions \"rippling water,\" it fails to describe this as an action. A more effective description would detail the motion of the ripples themselves—for instance, if they are slow and uniform or if they are disturbed by an unseen source. The description of the environment is too static; instead of just listing the tiles and lights, the caption should describe how the camera's movement affects our view of them, such as how the reflections of the square lights stretch and distort across the water's surface as the camera pulls away. The description should be a single, cohesive paragraph that integrates the scene's elements with the camera's movement, focusing purely on observable actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera begins at water level, slowly pulling back and tilting upward, revealing a long, narrow corridor filled with dark water. As the camera moves, the ripples on the water's surface shift gently, creating a dynamic pattern. The walls and ceiling are covered in small, off-white or pale green tiles, and the camera's motion causes the reflections of the bright, square ceiling lights to stretch and distort across the water. At the far end of the corridor, a doorway becomes visible, with steps leading out of the water, enhancing the sense of depth and perspective in the scene.",
