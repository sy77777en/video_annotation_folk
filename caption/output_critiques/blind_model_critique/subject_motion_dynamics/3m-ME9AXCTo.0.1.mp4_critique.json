    "pre_caption": "The background is filled with colorful, star-shaped lights that change colors and create a festive atmosphere. The couple holds each other gently, moving in a slow, intimate dance. The man and woman maintain eye contact, smiling and enjoying the moment. The lighting shifts between red, green, and blue hues, enhancing the romantic ambiance. The couple continues to dance, occasionally changing their hand positions and moving slightly to the rhythm. The background lights continue to change, adding to the dynamic and lively setting. The couple's movements are smooth and synchronized, reflecting their connection and the joy of the moment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with voluminous, golden, curly hair that reaches his shoulders is shown slow dancing with a woman. He wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bowtie, and a white flower corsage is pinned to his left lapel; he is smiling as he looks at the woman. The woman, who has long, straight, golden hair, wears a light-colored garment and looks back at the man as they dance closely.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and their general activity, it relies heavily on subjective interpretations and emotional language, such as \"romantic atmosphere,\" \"intimate dance,\" and \"joy of the moment,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions of observable actions. The caption also speculates on the couple's internal feelings (\"enjoying the moment,\" \"reflecting their connection\"), which violates the instruction to avoid describing anything uncertain. The description of the motion itself is generic and repetitive; instead of just stating they are in a \"slow dance,\" it would be more effective to detail the specific movements, such as the man leading the woman in a slow turn on the spot or the couple swaying from side to side. Furthermore, the caption dedicates too much space to the background lights rather than focusing on the subjects' motion. A more effective description would precisely detail their physical interaction, such as the man placing his hands on the woman's waist as she rests her arms on his shoulders, while they both smile and maintain eye contact as they slowly turn in a circle.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The couple stands close together, with the man placing his hands on the woman's waist and the woman resting her arms on his shoulders. They maintain eye contact and smile as they slowly turn in a circle. The background features colorful, star-shaped lights that change colors, but the focus remains on the couple's synchronized movements. The man gently leads the woman in a slow turn, and they sway from side to side, occasionally adjusting their hand positions while moving to the rhythm. The lighting shifts between red, green, and blue hues, complementing the couple's graceful dance.",
