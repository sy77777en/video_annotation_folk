    "pre_caption": "A person, wearing a light-colored shirt and blue flip-flops, is seen picking up two red bricks from a pile of similar bricks on the ground. The person then stands up, holding the bricks in both hands, and begins to walk forward. The background shows a construction site with more bricks, a green bowl, and a partially constructed brick wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person engaged in construction work, filmed from a head-mounted camera perspective. The individual, with medium skin tone, is wearing a light-colored shirt with rolled-up sleeves and blue flip-flops. They are handling red bricks, which are scattered on the ground. A green bowl containing a gray mixture, likely cement, is nearby. In another part of the video, a partially constructed brick wall is visible, along with more bricks and construction materials on the ground. The setting suggests an outdoor construction site.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is accurate in describing a plausible sequence of actions.\n*   **Completeness:** The description of the motion (picking up, standing, walking) is complete and presented in the correct chronological order.\n\nHowever, it fails to adhere to the following instructions:\n\n1.  **Unnecessary Description of Appearance:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption describes the person \"wearing a light-colored shirt and blue flip-flops,\" which is unnecessary as there is only one subject.\n2.  **Incorrect Focus:** The instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" The final sentence, \"The background shows a construction site with more bricks, a green bowl, and a partially constructed brick wall,\" describes static background elements in detail, which detracts from the primary focus on the subject's movement.\n3.  **Lack of Conciseness:** The phrase \"is seen picking up\" is passive and less concise than the active voice. A more direct description like \"A person picks up...\" would better align with the instruction for a \"clear, concise\" paragraph.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the events in chronological order, it includes superfluous details about the subject's appearance and the static background, directly violating the core instructions to focus strictly on motion and avoid unnecessary descriptions.",
