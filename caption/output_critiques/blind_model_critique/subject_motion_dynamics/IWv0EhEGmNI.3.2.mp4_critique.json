    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective seen through a green night-vision filter, a pair of hands wearing dark, textured gloves secures a thick, light-colored rope around a large wooden post. The left wrist features a dark-colored band with a watch-like device. The hands use a metal carabiner to fasten the rope to the post. Subsequently, a coiled portion of the rope is thrown downwards, unfurling into a long, glowing cyan line against the backdrop of a dark, distant town with illuminated buildings.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption provides a precise and factual description of a plausible sequence of events. It clearly identifies the subject (gloved hands), the objects (rope, post, carabiner), and the environment (high vantage point, dark town below).\n\n*   **Completeness:** It captures the entire motion from start to finish without leaving out key actions. It covers the preparation (wrapping and fastening the rope) and the main action (tossing the rope and its subsequent descent).\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows this rule, describing the actions in the exact sequence they occur: wrapping, fastening, tossing, and unfurling.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It uses strong, specific action verbs like \"wraps,\" \"fastens,\" \"toss,\" \"unfurls,\" and \"descends,\" which clearly describe the motion rather than just stating what is happening.\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is succinct yet detailed enough to give a clear picture of the events in a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional language, subjective opinions, and speculation. The word \"glowing\" is used as a descriptive visual detail, not a subjective quality, which is appropriate.\n    *   **Specificity:** The caption excels at being specific, detailing not just that a rope is secured, but *how* (\"wraps...around a wooden post and fastens it with a metal carabiner\").\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, objective, and focuses effectively on describing the subject's motion in chronological order.",
