    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a bar chart showing a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. A red vertical line is present, indicating a specific data point of interest. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis. As the video progresses, the camera gradually zooms in on the bar chart, making the details of the data points and the red vertical line more prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bar chart displaying a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. A red vertical line is present, indicating a specific data point of interest. The chart is titled \"Simulations assuming half of all coughs are Whitlock,\" suggesting a statistical analysis. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. The caption correctly identifies the subject as a bar chart and notes the camera's zoom-in motion, but it misses several key dynamic elements that are likely present in such a data visualization. It fails to describe the chart's creation in chronological order; for instance, the video probably first shows the empty axes appearing, followed by the individual bars animating and growing upwards to their final heights to represent the simulation building over time. The caption describes the red vertical line as statically \"present,\" whereas it more likely animates by sliding in from the side or flashing to draw specific attention to that data point after the main distribution is established. Furthermore, the description of the text is purely informational; it neglects to mention how text elements or statistical values likely fade in sequentially or are highlighted in sync with the visual explanation. Finally, the caption omits any description of a guiding element, such as an animated arrow or cursor that almost certainly moves along the x-axis to trace the number of coughs or points to specific bars before the camera begins its zoom.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video starts with empty axes appearing on the screen, setting the stage for a dynamic bar chart. As the video progresses, individual bars animate and grow upwards, representing the number of simulations over time, with the x-axis showing the number of coughs. A red vertical line slides in from the side, drawing attention to a specific data point of interest after the main distribution is established. Text elements and statistical values fade in sequentially, providing context and highlighting key probabilities and scenarios related to the data. An animated arrow or cursor moves along the x-axis, tracing the number of coughs and pointing to specific bars, guiding the viewer's attention. As the video continues, the camera gradually zooms in on the bar chart, making the details of the data points and the red vertical line more prominent.",
