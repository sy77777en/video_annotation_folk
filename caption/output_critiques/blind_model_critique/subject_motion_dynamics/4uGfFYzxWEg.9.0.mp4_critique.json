    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a bar chart showing a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. A red vertical line is present, indicating a specific data point of interest. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis. As the video progresses, the camera gradually zooms in on the bar chart, making the details of the data points and the red vertical line more prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bar chart displaying a distribution of data related to coughs during a quiz show scenario. The chart is predominantly black with vertical bars representing the number of simulations on the y-axis and the number of coughs on the x-axis. A red vertical line is present, indicating a specific data point of interest. The chart is titled \"Simulations assuming half of all coughs are Whitlock,\" suggesting a statistical analysis. The text surrounding the chart discusses probabilities and scenarios related to the data, providing context for the analysis.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a bar chart related to a specific scenario, notes its visual characteristics (black background, vertical bars, a red line, and surrounding text), and accurately describes the only motion in the video, which is a gradual camera zoom.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It describes the initial static state of the chart and then follows with a description of the camera movement that occurs, covering the entire duration of the video's action.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption succeeds in some areas but fails in a key aspect of the instructions.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description correctly presents the events in order: the chart is shown, and then the camera zooms in.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language, sticking to factual observations.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Primary Issue: Focus on Motion vs. Appearance:** The main instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption violates this by dedicating the first three-quarters of its length to a detailed description of the *static appearance* of the bar chart. The subject itself (the chart) has no motion. The only motion is the camera's. The caption should have briefly identified the static subject and then immediately described the camera's motion, which is the sole action in the video.\n*   **Conciseness:** Because it spends so much time describing the static elements, the caption is not concise. The essential information about the motion could have been conveyed much more briefly. The instructions state that if a subject has no movement, it should be mentioned briefly, but the caption goes into excessive detail about the static chart.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to the primary instruction of focusing on motion. While accurate and chronologically sound, it functions more as a detailed description of a static image rather than a description of action. A better caption would have minimized the description of the chart's appearance and focused entirely on the camera's zoom, which is the only movement that occurs.",
