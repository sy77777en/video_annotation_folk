  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively sets the scene by describing the low angle, the silhouetted trees, and the snowy landscape, but it fails to describe the motion of the Aurora Borealis, which is the primary subject. The phrase \"dynamic display\" is too generic and violates the instruction to describe *how* the subject moves. A better caption would detail the specific movements of the light. For example, I imagine the video shows the green light initially appearing as a soft, wide arc across the sky. This arc then begins to shimmer, and vertical pillars of light start to form and ripple from left to right, almost like a curtain waving in a gentle breeze. The caption should describe this progression, detailing how the aurora's shape and intensity change over time, rather than just stating that it is \"dynamic.\"",
