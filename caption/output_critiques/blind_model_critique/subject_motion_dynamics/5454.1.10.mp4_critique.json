    "pre_caption": "A group of people are standing on a metal railing, looking down at the camera. The background shows a cloudy sky and a tree branch with bare leaves. A sign on the railing reads 'NO BALL GAMES.' The individuals are dressed in various winter clothing, including jackets and hats. Some people are leaning on the railing, while others are standing upright. The camera remains stationary, capturing the group from a low angle, emphasizing their height and the railing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "No, this caption is not good because it fails to follow the core instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Primary Failure - Focus on Motion:** The main instruction is to describe the subject's **motion**. This caption does the exact opposite; it describes a completely static scene, focusing on what the people are wearing, their posture (\"leaning,\" \"standing upright\"), the background, and a sign. It does not describe any action or movement.\n*   **Violation of \"No Movement\" Rule:** If the subjects in the video are indeed not moving, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption goes into extensive detail about a static scene, which is explicitly what the instructions say to avoid. A correct caption for a static video would be something like: \"A group of people stands still on a metal railing.\"\n*   **Inclusion of Forbidden Abstract Descriptions:** The caption includes the phrase \"emphasizing their height and the railing,\" which is an abstract interpretation of the camera angle. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid abstract descriptions.\"\n*   **Inclusion of Unnecessary Details:** The caption describes the subjects' clothing, the background, and a sign on the railing. The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" These static details should have been omitted in favor of describing movement.\n\nIn summary, the caption fundamentally misunderstands the task. It provides a detailed static description of a scene when it was instructed to provide a concise description of motion.",
