    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This abstract video features a dark, brownish-gold background filled with digital elements. The bottom of the scene is composed of a dense, undulating surface made of countless tiny, glowing golden particles, resembling a shimmering digital sea. From this surface, numerous thin, vertical lines of golden light rise upwards, each with a brighter point at its tip. Throughout the scene, smaller, out-of-focus golden specks of light float and drift, all rising, creating a sense of depth and movement. A bright, horizontal glow is present at the horizon line, serving as the source for the rising light streaks.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main components and their general upward motion, it overlooks the more nuanced dynamics and interactions between the elements. The description of the smaller specks as simply \"drifting and floating\" is too generic; in the video, these particles actually swirl in small, chaotic eddies as they ascend, contrasting with the rigid verticality of the lines. Furthermore, the caption misses the direct causal link between the undulating surface and the rising lines; the lines are not just rising from the surface generally, but are specifically being emitted from the very crests of the waves as they form. Finally, the flow is not entirely \"constant,\" as the caption suggests. Instead, the intensity of the light and the density of the rising particles pulse in a clear rhythm, surging upwards in greater numbers in sync with the larger swells of the golden surface at the bottom, creating a more dynamic and rhythmic effect than a steady, continuous stream.",
