    "pre_caption": "The woman, dressed in a light-colored trench coat, stands in front of a large, circular, silver light reflector. She begins by facing the camera, with her hands near her collar, and then gradually turns her upper body away from the viewer, rotating counterclockwise. As she turns, her back becomes fully visible, and she continues to hold her hands near her collar. The background remains consistent throughout, featuring the large, reflective light panel and a brick wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with shoulder-length blonde hair stands in front of a very large, circular, silver, multi-panelled light reflector. She wears a light-colored trench coat with dark buttons and a matching belt that is the same color as the coat. The collar of the coat is turned up, matching the dark color of the buttons, and reveals light-colored lettering that spells \"TRENCH\" on the inside. Initially, she is facing the camera, but then she gradually turns her entire body away from the viewer, rotating counterclockwise, while holding her hands near her collar.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the basic chronological sequence of the woman's turn, but it lacks specificity regarding the finer details of her motion and the movement of her clothing. The description of her hands as \"near her collar\" is vague; in the video, she is specifically holding the lapels of the trench coat with her fingertips. The term \"gradually turns\" could be more descriptive, as she executes the clockwise rotation at a slow, controlled pace, pausing for a second when she is in profile to the camera before continuing the turn. Most importantly, the caption fails to mention the motion of the trench coat itself, which is a key visual element. As she turns, the bottom hem of the coat flares out slightly, and the tied belt sways with the movement. Finally, the description is ambiguous about the end of the action; it should clarify that she completes the turn and holds the pose with her back to the camera for the remainder of the shot, rather than just stating her back becomes visible.",
