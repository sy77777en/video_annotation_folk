    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video presents a first-person perspective from a video game, looking out over a sunny landscape with clouds. In the foreground, a black assault rifle with a scope is initially pointed towards the center of the scene, but later shifts to point towards the left. The environment contains several green, leafy trees and bushes scattered across the brown, uneven terrain. In the midground, a white sedan and another white car are parked near some simple, blocky structures. A digital heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower-left corner, a blue ammunition counter in the lower-right, and orange, diamond-shaped objective markers in the center.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and attempts a chronological description, its phrasing could be more precise and natural. The description of the player's movement as \"shifts slightly to the left, then moves forward and continues to the left\" is clunky; it likely depicts a single, fluid motion like turning while advancing or strafing diagonally, which could be stated more concisely. The term \"retracted\" is probably inaccurate for the weapon's movement; in the context of the rifle shifting to the bottom left, it is more likely being lowered into a \"low ready\" or sprinting position, which is a different action than putting the weapon away. Finally, the statement \"A black car moves to the background\" is ambiguous. It fails to clarify whether the car is driving on its own or if it is a stationary object that simply recedes and shifts in the frame as a result of the player's own movement and change in perspective. A better description would specify that the player's advance causes the stationary car to appear to move into the distance.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The view from a first-person perspective smoothly turns to the left while moving forward over uneven, rocky terrain. It then stops, turns further left, and zooms in as the weapon is aimed down its sights. While aiming, the view advances again before halting. As the player moves, a stationary black car in the background appears to recede into the distance due to the change in perspective.",
