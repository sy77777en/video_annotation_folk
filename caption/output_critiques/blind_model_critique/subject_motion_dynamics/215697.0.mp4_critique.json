    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a dark, star-filled space, with various shades of blue, green, and purple hues dominating the scene. As the camera moves forward, the stars and nebulae appear to shift and change, creating a sense of motion and depth. The colors and patterns continue to evolve, with some areas becoming brighter and more defined while others fade or blend into the background. The overall scene remains consistent with a cosmic theme, featuring a mix of bright stars and dark, cloudy regions. The camera's forward motion enhances the sense of exploration and discovery, as the viewer is led deeper into the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video depicts a vast, abstract cosmic scene filled with swirling clouds of gas and dust in various shades of blue, green, and purple. Numerous small, bright stars are scattered throughout, creating a sense of depth and vastness. The colors blend seamlessly, giving the impression of a dynamic and expansive universe. The overall composition suggests a celestial environment, possibly representing a nebula or a distant galaxy. The visual elements are fluid and ethereal, emphasizing the complexity and beauty of the cosmos.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to accurately describe the visual content of a common stock video: a camera moving through a computer-generated starfield or nebula.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption identifies the primary motion (the camera moving forward) and its effect on the scene (stars and nebulae shifting). It follows a chronological order.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several key instructions, making it unsuitable.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Avoid abstract descriptions\":** The caption uses phrases like \"creating a sense of motion and depth,\" \"enhances the sense of exploration and discovery,\" and \"as the viewer is led deeper into the space.\" These are abstract interpretations of the effect on the viewer, not direct, objective descriptions of motion. This is similar to the forbidden example \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Concise\":** The video described is a simple scenery shot with camera motion. The instructions state that for such videos, the description should be brief (one to three sentences). The provided caption is five sentences long and overly descriptive of static elements.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the subject's motion\":** The caption spends too much time describing static visual details like \"various shades of blue, green, and purple hues\" and \"a mix of bright stars and dark, cloudy regions\" instead of focusing purely on the motion.\n\n**In summary,** the caption is not good because it is too long, includes forbidden subjective and abstract language, and focuses excessively on static visual appearance rather than adhering to the core instruction of providing a concise, objective description of motion.",
