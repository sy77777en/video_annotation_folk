    "pre_caption": "A man in a black suit with a white dress shirt is seen running forward with his arms raised, appearing to be in a state of urgency or distress. Behind him, a large mass of water is forcefully breaking through a glass barrier, creating a dramatic splash and sending water spraying in all directions. The background shows a room with wooden paneling and a chandelier, indicating an indoor setting, possibly a restaurant or a formal event. The water continues to pour in, causing significant disruption and chaos in the room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a black suit with a white dress shirt, who is the main subject. He appears to be in his 30s, with short dark hair, jumping up with a focused expression. The video captures him with arms raised, emphasizing the dynamic movement. In the background, there are two other men; one is partially visible, wearing a light-colored jacket, and appears to be turning away from the action, while the other is bent over a table, possibly reacting to the commotion. Additionally, a man in red is visible, though he is not a significant character. The scene conveys a sense of urgency and dramatic action centered around the main subject.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to accurately describe the events in a plausible video scene. It correctly identifies a man running, a glass barrier breaking, and water flooding an indoor space.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete, describing the initial action of the man, the subsequent action of the water breaking through the barrier, and the continuing effect of the water pouring in. The actions are presented in a logical, chronological order.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It violates several core rules:\n\n*   **Avoids Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption fails this rule by using words like \"urgency,\" \"distress,\" \"dramatic,\" \"significant disruption,\" and \"chaos.\" These words interpret the scene's mood rather than objectively describing the motion.\n*   **Avoids Speculative Statements:** The caption directly violates this rule with phrases like \"**appearing to be** in a state of urgency or distress\" and \"**possibly** a restaurant or a formal event.\" The instructions explicitly forbid such speculative language.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** While it describes motion, the caption includes unnecessary details about the subject's appearance (\"in a black suit with a white dress shirt\") and the background (\"wooden paneling and a chandelier\"), which detracts from the primary focus on movement.\n*   **Conciseness:** The inclusion of subjective interpretations, speculative possibilities, and non-essential appearance details makes the caption less concise than it should be.\n\nIn summary, the caption successfully identifies the subjects and their actions in chronological order, but it heavily relies on the exact type of subjective, speculative, and emotional language the instructions explicitly prohibit.",
