    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of a large, leafless tree, focusing on its thick trunk and sprawling branches against a clear blue sky. The camera slowly pans to the left, maintaining the focus on the tree's trunk and branches, which remain barren and devoid of leaves. The sunlight creates a lens flare effect as it filters through the branches, adding a subtle glow to the scene. The camera continues to move left, revealing more of the tree's structure and the intricate patterns on its bark. The video concludes with the camera still panning left, providing a comprehensive view of the tree's trunk and branches from a slightly different angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large, leafless tree with a thick, textured trunk and numerous sprawling branches extending outward. The bark is rough and gray, with visible patterns and knots. The branches are bare, showcasing a network of smaller twigs against the sky. The tree's imposing structure and intricate details are highlighted, emphasizing its size and natural complexity.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions, primarily regarding focus and conciseness for a video with a static subject.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual content in a plausible video. It correctly identifies the subject (a leafless tree), the background (blue sky), and a visual effect (lens flare).\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description covers the entire duration of the video, noting the beginning, the continuous action, and the conclusion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Focus on Subject's Motion (Major Issue):** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion\" and \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that.\" The subject, the tree, is static. Instead of briefly noting this, the caption focuses almost entirely on the *camera's* motion (\"camera slowly pans,\" \"camera continues to move,\" \"camera still panning\"). While the camera movement is the only action, the description is overly detailed about the camera's role, which goes against the core instruction to prioritize the *subject*.\n\n*   **Conciseness (Major Issue):** The instructions for a scenery shot or a static subject call for a brief description of one to three sentences. This caption is five sentences long and highly repetitive. The action of the camera panning left is mentioned three separate times, which is redundant and makes the description unnecessarily long for such a simple scene.\n\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple and natural, which is good. However, the repetitive structure makes it less coherent and clear than it could be.\n\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption mostly uses objective language. However, words like \"intricate\" (to describe bark patterns) and \"comprehensive\" (to describe the view) are slightly interpretive rather than purely descriptive.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption fails because it misinterprets the core task. For a video of a static subject, the instructions require a brief, concise statement noting the lack of subject movement. This caption does the opposite: it provides a lengthy, repetitive, and detailed account of the camera's movement, making the camera the main character instead of the tree.\n\nA better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\n\"A large, leafless tree remains stationary as the camera pans slowly to the left, moving across its trunk and branches against a blue sky.\"",
