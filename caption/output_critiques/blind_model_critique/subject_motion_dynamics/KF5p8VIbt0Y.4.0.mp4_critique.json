    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two women with light skin, both wearing dark, loose-fitting garments and head coverings that drape over their hair and shoulders. The woman on the left has pronounced dark eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a somber expression, with her hand raised to her chest in one moment and her gaze directed slightly upward. The woman on the right, positioned closely beside her, has similarly styled clothing and head covering, with delicate facial features and wide eyes, and she leans gently toward the woman on the left, looking up with a concerned or attentive expression. A third subject, a hand with light skin and long fingers, appears in the foreground, from center-bottom to top, brushing the air in front of the woman on the left. In the background, a partially visible face of another person can be seen, but their features are obscured by shadow and distance. The overall focus remains on the two women and the reaching hand, with their close proximity and attentive postures suggesting a shared moment of concern or attention.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good but has minor areas for improvement. It successfully describes the motion of multiple subjects in a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate in detailing the specific movements of the subjects, such as \"raises her hand to her chest,\" \"looks slightly upward,\" and \"leans gently.\"\n*   The description of the hand \"brushing the air\" might be slightly interpretive. If the hand is simply making a gesture without touching anything, a more objective phrase like \"gestures upward\" would be more precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies four distinct subjects (woman on the left, woman on the right, a hand, and a face) and describes the motion, or lack thereof, for each one. It effectively uses location cues (\"on the left,\" \"in the foreground\") to differentiate them.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption excels at describing specific actions (\"raises her hand,\" \"leans,\" \"moves upward\") rather than static appearances.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Subject Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction between the two women (\"leans gently toward the woman on the left and looks up at her\").\n    *   **No Speculation:** For the most part, it avoids speculative language.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** While it starts with \"first,\" the timing of the subsequent actions is not explicitly ordered. It's unclear if the other movements happen at the same time or after the first action. A better structure might be: \"The woman on the left first raises her hand... As this happens, the woman on the right leans...\" to clarify concurrent actions.\n    *   **Subjective Language:** The word \"attentive\" is a subjective interpretation of the woman's mental state, which violates the instruction to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" Describing her physical posture, such as \"remains oriented toward the other woman,\" would be more objective. The word \"gently\" is borderline but acceptable as it describes the quality of the motion (slow and with little force).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The woman on the left first raises her hand to her chest and looks slightly upward, remaining mostly still. As this happens, the woman on the right leans toward the woman on the left and looks up at her, staying close and oriented toward her. A third subject, a hand with long fingers, gestures upward in the foreground, moving in front of the woman on the left. The partially visible face in the background remains still.",
