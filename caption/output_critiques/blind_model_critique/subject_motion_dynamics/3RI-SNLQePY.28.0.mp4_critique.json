    "pre_caption": "The mouse cursor circles the gumball machine's lever. The lever then rotates, causing several multicolored gumballs to dispense from the machine and fall onto the surface below. One of these, a white gumball with a brown hole, is then enlarged and moves to the center of the screen, before shrinking back to its original size and position among the other dispensed gumballs. The view then returns to the gumball machine.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a gumball machine with a beige base and a transparent globe filled with multicolored gumballs. A metal lever is present, and a mouse icon moving in circles suggests an interactive game where the player spins the lever to release the gumballs. Among the dispensed gumballs, a unique white gumball with a brown hole is highlighted. This special gumball is enlarged and displayed prominently, indicating that the player examined it closely, before the view returns to the original scene. The focus remains on the machine and the action of dispensing the gumballs.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a logical and clear sequence of events that would occur in a digital animation or interactive video. Each action (cursor circling, lever rotating, gumballs dispensing, one gumball enlarging and shrinking) is described precisely and factually. The description of the specific gumball (\"a white gumball with a brown hole\") is a good use of detail to clarify which subject is undergoing motion, assuming it is accurate to the video content.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It captures the entire motion sequence from the initial interaction to the final state. It successfully describes the cause-and-effect relationship between the cursor, the lever, and the gumballs. It also correctly identifies and describes the \"spotlight\" moment where one gumball is highlighted before returning to the group, and it concludes by noting the final change in view.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows all instructions flawlessly:\n*   **Chronological Order:** Actions are presented in a clear, sequential order, reinforced by words like \"then\" and \"before.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The entire description is centered on specific movements: \"circles,\" \"rotates,\" \"dispense,\" \"fall,\" \"enlarged,\" \"moves,\" \"shrinking,\" and \"returns.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a single, easy-to-read paragraph without any filler.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids jargon or complex sentence structures.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Specificity:** It describes *how* things move (e.g., \"lever rotates,\" \"gumballs dispense and fall\") rather than using generic terms. It also clearly describes the interaction between the cursor and the lever.\n*   **Shot Transitions:** It correctly notes the final transition where \"The view then returns to the gumball machine.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, precise, and comprehensive.",
