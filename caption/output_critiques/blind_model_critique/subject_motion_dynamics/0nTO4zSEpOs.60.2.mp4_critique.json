    "pre_caption": "The video shows a staircase at night with several people walking up and down. The camera moves forward, capturing the descent of the stairs. A person in a green jacket and white pants walks down the stairs, followed by a person in a beige jacket and blue pants. Another person in a gray hoodie and black pants appears at the top of the stairs and begins to descend. The camera continues to move forward, showing the person in the gray hoodie walking down the stairs. The staircase is empty as the camera reaches the bottom.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **good** but could be improved for conciseness and adherence to formatting rules. It successfully captures the essential motion in chronological order using objective language.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate. It describes a plausible and clear sequence of events: the camera's forward movement down a staircase and the specific movements of three different individuals, identified by their clothing, as they descend.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is complete. It covers the entire duration of the likely video clip, starting with an initial scene of people on the stairs, tracking the main subjects' movements, and concluding with the final state where the staircase is empty. It effectively includes both the camera's motion and the subjects' motion.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at presenting the actions in a clear, step-by-step chronological sequence.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly focuses on the motion of the subjects (\"walks down,\" \"begins to descend\") and the camera (\"moves forward\").\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language, sticking to observable facts.\n    *   **Differentiating Subjects:** It properly uses appearance details (e.g., \"person in a green jacket\") to distinguish between the multiple subjects, as instructed.\n    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Introductory Text:** The first sentence, \"The video shows a staircase at night with several people walking up and down,\" acts as an introductory phrase. The instructions state to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption should begin directly with the description of the motion.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The description can be made more concise by integrating the camera's motion with the subjects' actions. For example, instead of stating the camera's movement in separate clauses, it could be combined.\n\n**Revised Example (incorporating feedback):**\n\nAs the camera moves forward down a staircase at night, a person in a green jacket and white pants descends, followed by a person in a beige jacket and blue pants. A third person in a gray hoodie and black pants then appears at the top and walks down the stairs. The camera continues its forward movement until it reaches the bottom of the now-empty staircase.",
