    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A silhouetted figure wearing a dark outfit and a helmet adorned with a single, forward-pointing horn sits atop a rugged, dark vehicle that appears to be a custom-built ATV or trike. The scene takes place in a dark, rocky, and dusty environment, suggestive of a cave. The vehicle's single headlamp casts a cone of yellowish-white light onto the uneven ground, cutting through the hazy air. To the right, a large, textured rock wall is bathed in an intense red glow, creating a stark contrast with the surrounding darkness. The figure is positioned on the vehicle, facing towards the left.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a static scene, identifying the subject (\"a person\"), the object they are on (\"a vehicle\"), and their state of motion (\"motionless,\" \"stationary\").\n*   **Completeness:** It sufficiently describes the entire scene from a motion perspective. Since there is no movement, it correctly and completely captures this by stating the subject and vehicle are not moving.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption perfectly adheres to the instruction for static subjects: \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that.\" It does this clearly with the words \"motionless\" and \"stationary.\"\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, clear sentence that is easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids any subjective, emotional, or speculative language.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** This rule is not applicable as there are no sequential actions, and the caption correctly omits any attempt to create a narrative.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as instructed.",
