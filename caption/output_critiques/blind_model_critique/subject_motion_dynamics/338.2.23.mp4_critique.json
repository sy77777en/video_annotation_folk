    "pre_caption": "In a restaurant with ornate wooden decor and warm lighting, a group of people are seated around a dining table. A woman in a blue vest stands up from her seat and begins to walk away from the table. The man in the white shirt, holding a blue napkin and chopsticks, continues to engage in conversation with the man in the yellow shirt, who is also holding chopsticks. The woman in the green top remains seated, eating and conversing with the others. The background shows other diners and waitstaff moving around, with three men in maroon shirts carrying trays with food.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of people seated around a dining table in a restaurant setting. At the center, a man with short dark hair, wearing a light-colored shirt, is holding a blue napkin and chopsticks in his left hand. To his right, a man with short hair and glasses, dressed in a dark shirt, is engaged in conversation. Across from them, a woman with long dark hair, wearing a green top, is seen from behind. Another man, wearing a yellow shirt and glasses, is holding chopsticks. In the background, three men in maroon shirts are walking while carrying trays with food. The setting is characterized by ornate wooden panels and warm lighting, creating a lively dining atmosphere.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological overview, but it misses the specific dynamics of the subjects' movements. The description of the man in the white shirt \"engaging in conversation\" is too general; the video likely shows him gesturing emphatically with his chopsticks while speaking, and the man in yellow nodding in response before lifting his own chopsticks to point at a dish. The woman's action of \"eating\" could be more precise, such as \"lifts a piece of food from a shared platter and places it in her bowl.\" The server's motion is described, but the interaction could be more detailed; for example, she might lean over the shoulder of one diner to carefully set the bowl down in the center of the table. Finally, the description of the three men in maroon shirts is a strong detail, but their movement could be specified as \"walking in a single file line from the kitchen area,\" which would better convey the coordinated activity visible in the background.",
