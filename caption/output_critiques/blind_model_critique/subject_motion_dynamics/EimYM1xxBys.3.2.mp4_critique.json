    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens with a blurry, level-angle, upside-down view of a long, grated metal walkway in a dark, futuristic setting. As the camera moves, rotates and comes into focus, it reveals a figure in bulky, dark robotic armor with yellow accents and a glowing red visor, identified by on-screen text as \"PCPD Cop 02.\" This armored figure stands next to a second person, who is initially seen kneeling before lying face down on the walkway, dressed in reddish-brown clothing. A speech bubble appears above the armored figure. Below is overlay text, \"Got you now, you piece of shit.\"**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events but could be more specific about the nature of the movements. The description \"falling forward from a kneeling position\" is a bit vague; imagining the video, the person seems to collapse heavily or slump forward with a sense of finality, which is a more descriptive action. Similarly, \"An armored figure approaches\" is too generic. In the video I'm picturing, the figure strides purposefully and menacingly toward the fallen person, a detail that adds significant tone and context to the interaction. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the armored figure's posture once they stop; for instance, they might be standing with a triumphant or imposing stance, looking down at the body, which is a key part of the interaction. Lastly, while mentioning the \"small particles\" is good, specifying what they are (e.g., embers, dust, or digital artifacts) would better ground the scene in its environment.",
