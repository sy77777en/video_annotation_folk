    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a close-up of a dark gray, matte-finished USB drive being inserted vertically into a port. The drive's silver metal connector has a white plastic interior with visible red contacts. It is lowered into a USB-A port, which is one of a series of rectangular slots on the top surface of a light gray electronic device. The device itself has a dark gray trim along its edge. The action concludes with the USB drive fully inserted into the port.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"USB drive\" and describes its motion and interaction with another object (\"a port on an electronic device\") precisely as it happens. The terms \"lowered vertically,\" \"inserted,\" and \"fully seated\" are specific and factually correct descriptions of the action.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It covers the entire sequence of motion from the beginning (being lowered) to the end (being fully seated) without leaving out any essential steps. For a simple, singular action like this, the description is comprehensive.\n\n**Adherence to the given instruction:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the sequence of events: the drive is lowered, then inserted, and then it is seated.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, clear sentence that effectively communicates the entire action.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely focused on the movement of the USB drive and its interaction, avoiding any details about its appearance (color, brand) or the device it's plugged into.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** It uses simple, natural English that is easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs and adverbs (\"lowered vertically,\" \"inserted,\" \"fully seated\") instead of generic terms, clearly describing the interaction and its result.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph (in this case, a single sentence) with no introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions to create a precise, objective, and clear description of motion.",
