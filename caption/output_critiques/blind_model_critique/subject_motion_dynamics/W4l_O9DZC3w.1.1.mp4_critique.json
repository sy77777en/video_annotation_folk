    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with dark skin and braided hair holds onto two thick, white ropes with her arms outstretched and jumps, causing the camera to move around her. She is wearing a textured, light-colored sleeveless dress over a white spaghetti strap top, red leggings, and gold shoes.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback focuses too heavily on the camera's movement rather than the subject's actions, which is the primary requirement. The description of the woman's motion is overly simplistic, stating only that she \"jumps.\" It's more likely she performs a specific athletic movement; for instance, she might perform a power jump while simultaneously slamming the ropes into the ground, or perhaps she executes a tuck jump while raising the ropes. The caption also fails to describe the full chronological sequence of her action, as it omits what happens after the jump, such as how she lands or if she resets for another repetition. The interaction with the ropes is described passively as \"holding,\" but a more accurate description would detail how she actively manipulates them throughout the jump and landing, as this is central to her motion. The description should be revised to detail the specific type of jump and the corresponding action with the ropes, such as \"The woman jumps into the air, lifting the heavy ropes above her head before forcefully slamming them onto the dirt path as she lands in a squat.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman stands on a dirt path, gripping two thick ropes with determination. She performs a powerful tuck jump, lifting the ropes high above her head. As she ascends, the camera rotates 180 degrees, flipping the view upside down to show her against a blue sky. Upon landing in a controlled squat, she forcefully slams the ropes onto the ground, preparing to reset for another explosive repetition.",
