    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video. It effectively and accurately follows all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption describes a clear and plausible sequence of events. It is specific about the subjects (\"two men in suits and clown masks\"), their actions (\"run,\" \"moves behind,\" \"follows\"), the objects they interact with (\"holding a handgun\"), and their relationship to the environment (\"through a long hall,\" \"behind a long wooden counter\").\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive without being overly detailed. It captures the primary motion of the two main subjects from start to finish and also includes the relevant secondary motion of the figures in the background. This gives a full picture of the activity in the scene.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels here. It clearly states that the man on the right \"runs ahead\" and the man on the left \"follows,\" establishing a perfect chronological sequence of actions.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely centered on motion, using strong, specific verbs like \"run,\" \"moves behind,\" \"follows,\" and \"running alongside.\" It avoids static descriptions of appearance beyond what is necessary to identify the subjects.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is written in simple, natural English. It forms a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** It correctly avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"menacingly,\" \"frantically\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"they might be robbing the place\").\n*   **Specificity:** The actions are described with precision. Instead of just \"two men run,\" it details their distinct paths relative to the counter (\"moves behind\" vs. \"running alongside\"), which is a key detail of their motion.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly identifies the two men in the foreground as the main subjects and describes their actions in detail, while properly summarizing the background characters' movements collectively (\"other masked figures move around\").\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption is concrete and factual, avoiding abstract interpretations of the action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two men in suits and clown masks sprint through a long hallway. The man on the right, clutching a handgun, dashes ahead and ducks behind a long wooden counter. The man on the left, also armed, follows closely, running parallel to the counter. In the background, other masked figures navigate around another counter further down the hall.",
