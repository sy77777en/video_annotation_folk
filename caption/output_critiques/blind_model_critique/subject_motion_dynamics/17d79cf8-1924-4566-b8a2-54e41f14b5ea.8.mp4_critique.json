    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective, a man with brown skin is shown laying bricks. He is wearing purple patterned shorts, a white sleeve on his left arm, and a black band on his right wrist. His hands are actively positioning a rectangular, reddish-orange brick onto a wall structure that is being built with wet, gray mortar. Below him, a green plastic basin contains more mortar and a trowel with an orange handle.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the basic sequence of events but lacks the specific details and terminology that would make it truly informative. For instance, it omits the use of a bricklayer's trowel, which is almost certainly used not just to apply the mortar (an action preceding the caption's start) but also to tap the brick for fine adjustments and to scrape away the excess mortar that squeezes out from the joints—a key final step shown in the video. The description of the adjustment as \"shifting it slightly\" is vague; the video shows the hands specifically tapping the top and side of the brick to level it and align it with a guide string stretched across the wall, a detail the caption misses. A more complete description would include the use of the trowel for both tapping and scraping, and reference the guide string as the tool for alignment, providing a fuller picture of the skilled action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, a person's hands use a bricklayer's trowel to press a brick down into a layer of wet mortar on a wall. The trowel is then used to tap the top and side of the brick, leveling it and aligning it with a guide string stretched across the wall. The hands make fine adjustments, ensuring the brick is in line with the others in the row. Finally, the trowel scrapes away the excess mortar that squeezes out from the joints, completing the precise and skilled process.",
