    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In the middle ground, a medium-skinned, middle-aged man with graying dark hair, a mustache, and glasses leans forward with a shocked expression, his mouth agape. He wears a yellow jumpsuit with a blue patch on the right shoulder with a white background. To the left and slightly behind him, another man with short, dark hair and glasses, wearing an identical yellow jumpsuit, stands with his back partially to the viewer, his left arm raised. In the middle ground, between these two, a younger, light-skinned man with short dark hair is depicted. He is dressed in a white chef's coat and a striped apron, and he looks toward the man in the middle ground with a concerned expression.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the basic camera movements—a slow zoom-in and a clockwise rotation—and notes that the subjects are motionless. However, it lacks specificity regarding the camera's path and focus. In the video I watched, the camera doesn't just perform a generic zoom; it deliberately pushes in toward the face of a single child standing in the back row of a vintage class photograph. By omitting this focal point, the caption fails to convey the narrative intent of the motion, which is to isolate and highlight one individual from the group. Furthermore, the phrase \"a slow zoom-in and a clockwise rotation\" is ambiguous about whether these actions are simultaneous or sequential. The video shows a single, fluid motion where the zoom and rotation are perfectly synchronized. A more accurate description would specify the target of the zoom and clarify the concurrent nature of the movements, such as: \"While the subjects in the photograph remain motionless, the camera slowly zooms in on a child in the back row and rotates clockwise at the same time.\"",
