    "pre_caption": "A group of three elephants, comprising two adults and one baby, traverses the savanna from right to left. The rearmost adult elephant proceeds, with the baby elephant moving ahead of it. Leading the group, another adult elephant walks in front of the baby. All three maintain a consistent walking pace as they move through the tall, dry grass.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of dark grey African elephants traversing a savanna landscape characterized by tall, dry, yellow-brown grass. An adult elephant, viewed from its left side, walks across the scene from right to left; it has visible tusks. A significantly smaller, dark grey baby elephant walks in front of this adult. Another adult elephant, also dark grey and similar in size to the first, walks in front of the baby, maintaining the same direction and profile view. Meanwhile, one elephant remains stationary as the three elephants move from right to left.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the number of elephants and their general right-to-left movement, but it misses several key details about their specific actions and interactions. The description of their movement as a \"consistent walking pace\" is an oversimplification; in the video, the baby elephant occasionally breaks into a brief trot to keep up with the larger strides of the adult in front of it. A significant interaction is also omitted: the rearmost adult periodically uses its trunk to gently nudge the baby's hindquarters, seemingly to keep it moving and in line. Furthermore, the description of the fourth elephant as \"stationary behind the group, observing\" is imprecise. This elephant is positioned to the far right of the frame, and while it is stationary, a more objective description would be that it stands with its body angled toward the departing group, occasionally flapping its ears, rather than the interpretive \"observing.\" Finally, the sentence structure describing the order of the three moving elephants is slightly redundant and could be condensed for a more fluid description of the single-file formation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A group of three elephants, consisting of two adults and one baby, moves across the savanna from right to left in a single-file formation. The leading adult walks steadily, while the baby occasionally breaks into a brief trot to keep up with its larger strides. The rearmost adult gently nudges the baby's hindquarters with its trunk to keep it moving and in line. Meanwhile, a fourth elephant stands to the far right of the frame, its body angled toward the departing group, occasionally flapping its ears. All three moving elephants navigate through the tall, dry grass.",
