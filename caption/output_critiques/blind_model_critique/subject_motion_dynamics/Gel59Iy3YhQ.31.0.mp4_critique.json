    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A small, stylized character stands on a stone platform, completely enveloped in a dark reddish-brown, hooded cloak from which two pointed ears or horns protrude. This character holds an object that emits a vibrant purple glow. A large, spectral creature materializes from beneath the water surrounding the platform, appearing as a translucent form outlined in a bright, neon-green glow. The creature has a stylized, squid-like appearance with long, curving tentacles and sheds small, light green water droplets as it fully materializes.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological overview, but it could be more precise in describing the interaction and the sequence of events. The phrase \"make contact with the platform\" is vague; a more specific description, such as \"press up from beneath the platform\" or \"curl around the edges of the platform,\" would better illustrate the motion. Furthermore, the caption presents the platform's ascent and the creature's emergence as two distinct, sequential actions. It is more likely that these events are concurrent, with the creature's body breaking the surface of the water *as* its tentacles are lifting the platform in a single, continuous upward movement. The description of the splashing is good, but linking it directly to the creature breaking the water's surface, rather than the more abstract \"materializes,\" would be more accurate. Finally, the caption misses an opportunity to describe the quality of the motion, such as whether the platform rises slowly and majestically or quickly and abruptly, which is a key detail for conveying the scene's tone.",
