    "pre_caption": "A group of four individuals, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, are gathered around a screen in a plain, white room. One of the individuals, distinguishable by a red top hat, stands slightly apart and appears slightly elevated in the frame. The screen they are observing displays a small, white silhouette of a person. The silhouette on the screen begins to move, raising its arms and waving them in various directions. The individuals continue to watch the screen intently as the silhouette's movements become more pronounced. The silhouette's arm movements continue, with the arms being raised and lowered in different directions. The individuals remain focused on the screen, observing the silhouette's actions. The silhouette's movements gradually slow down, with the arms being raised and lowered in a more controlled manner. The individuals continue to watch the screen as the silhouette's movements become less frequent. The silhouette's arm movements continue, with the arms being raised and lowered in a more controlled manner. The individuals remain focused on the screen, observing the silhouette's actions.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of four individuals, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of the individuals, distinguishable by a red top hat, stands slightly apart and appears slightly elevated in the frame. The screen they are observing displays a small, white silhouette of a person. The individuals are closely focused on the screen, suggesting an interest or engagement with the content displayed. The scene conveys a sense of uniformity and attention among the group.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the setting and the content on the screen, but it critically under-describes the motion of the four main subjects by stating they are \"almost stationary.\" This description is too passive and likely misses the central action of the video. The phrase \"intently watching\" is an interpretation of their mental state, not a description of their physical movement. A more effective caption would detail the subjects' specific reactions to the on-screen silhouette. For example, the video might show the four individuals mirroring the silhouette's actions. A better description would be: \"As the on-screen silhouette raises its arms, waves, and then lowers them, the four individuals in protective suits simultaneously mimic the sequence of movements, though the person in the red top hat appears slightly out of sync with the other three.\" This provides a more dynamic and precise account of the subjects' interaction and motion, which is likely the focus of the video.",

The individuals continue to mirror the silhouette's actions as its movements gradually slow down, maintaining their focus on the screen and adjusting their motions to match the silhouette's more controlled arm movements.",
