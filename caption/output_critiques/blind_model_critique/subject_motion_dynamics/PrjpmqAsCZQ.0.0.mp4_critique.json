    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a medium build, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. He is seated at a desk with electronic equipment, including a few keyboards and a mouse. The scene has a dark green color filter, suggesting a night vision effect. The video is blurry and low resolution. The man is engaged in manipulating the equipment, with a focus on his hands interacting with a glowing object, possibly a small device or control. His posture is slightly leaned forward, indicating concentration on the task at hand.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially good** but has one significant flaw that violates a core instruction.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a man), his initial state (seated at a desk), the environment (dimly lit with electronic equipment), his primary action (picking up and examining a glowing object), and a subsequent camera movement (a zoom). All described events are factually correct based on a typical video of this nature.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It covers the sequence of events from start to finish in a logical order. However, the action \"examines it closely\" is a bit general. To be more complete and adhere to the instruction to \"specify how they move,\" it could have described the motion more precisely (e.g., \"rotates it in his hands,\" \"brings it closer to his face\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence: the man is seated, then he picks up the object, then the focus shifts to the object.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear, brief summary of the video's content.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Object Interaction:** It clearly describes the man's interaction with the glowing object (\"picks up,\" \"examines\").\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Focus on Subject's Motion vs. Camera Movement:** The main issue is the final sentence: \"The camera zooms in on the glowing object, highlighting its bright light.\" The instructions explicitly state to **\"Focus on the subject's motion\"** and to avoid describing anything not directly related to the subject's actions. Describing a camera zoom is a description of cinematography, not the subject's movement. This is a direct violation of the core instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good at setting the scene and describing the initial action chronologically and objectively. However, it fails a key requirement by describing a camera movement instead of sticking strictly to the subject's motion.\n\nA better caption that fully adheres to the instructions would be:\n\n**A man seated at a desk picks up a glowing object and holds it up to examine it from different angles.**",
