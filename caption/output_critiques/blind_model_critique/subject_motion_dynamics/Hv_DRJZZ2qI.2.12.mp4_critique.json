    "pre_caption": "The man in the green and yellow shirt initially faces a pregnant woman, engaging in conversation. He then turns his back to the camera and walks away from the group, moving up a slight incline on the dirt path. The pregnant woman, who was standing and talking to him, turns slightly to watch him depart. A brown dog on a leash, initially near the group, walks alongside the man as he moves away. Behind the pregnant woman, another man with a backpack remains relatively still. In the background, two other women stand on the path; one gestures while they converse.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a man with short brown hair and a beard, wearing a green and yellow long-sleeved athletic shirt with \"ZINK\" in yellow lettering on the back and \"Troy Lee Designs\" on the sleeve. He has goggles with a red and white strap around his neck. He is interacting with a pregnant woman who has long blonde hair and is wearing a light grey beanie, a black top under an open blue zip-up hoodie, and grey pants. Standing behind the pregnant woman is another man wearing a black t-shirt, a black baseball cap with sunglasses on his face, and a large grey and black backpack. A medium-sized brown dog on a leash is visible near the group. Further in the background, two other women are standing on a dirt path; one wears a black top and blue jeans, and the other wears a dark top, light green pants, and a green cap.**",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is that it misses key relational details and lacks specificity in describing the quality of the movements. For instance, it states the man and woman are \"engaging in conversation\" but fails to describe the physical actions that convey this, such as head nodding or hand gestures. The most significant omission is the handler of the dog; the caption says the dog walks in the opposite direction, but not who is holding the leash, which is a crucial detail for understanding the group's dynamics and the reason for the dog's movement. Furthermore, the description of the main subject's departure as simply \"walks away\" is too generic; the video likely shows a specific pace or manner of walking (e.g., briskly, slowly, purposefully) that would add important context. Finally, while the pregnant woman \"turns slightly,\" a more precise description of her body's rotation or a shift in her posture would better capture the motion seen in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man in the green and yellow shirt initially faces a pregnant woman, engaging in conversation with animated gestures and occasional head nodding. He then turns his back to the camera and walks away from the group at a leisurely pace, moving up a slight incline on the dirt path. The pregnant woman, who was standing and talking to him, shifts her weight and turns her upper body slightly to watch him depart. A brown dog on a leash, held by the man with the backpack standing behind the pregnant woman, walks alongside the departing man. In the background, two other women stand on the path; one gestures expressively as they converse.",
