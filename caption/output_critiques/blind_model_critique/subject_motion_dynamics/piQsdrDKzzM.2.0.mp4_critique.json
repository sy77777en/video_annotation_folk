    "pre_caption": "The man, dressed in a dark jacket, is seen in a dimly lit parking area with concrete pillars and a few bicycles in the background. He begins to walk slowly, his gaze fixed ahead, indicating a sense of contemplation or concern. The camera follows his movement, maintaining a close-up focus on his upper body and face. The background remains consistent, with the parking area's features, such as the pillars and bicycles, remaining visible throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with short, dark hair and a medium skin tone. He is wearing a dark jacket and appears to be in a dimly lit environment. His expression is serious and contemplative. The man is positioned near a car, suggesting he might be interacting with it or preparing to leave. His posture is upright, and he seems to be focused on something outside the frame. The setting appears to be an indoor parking area, adding a sense of isolation to the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The critique is that the caption violates several key instructions. It speculates on the man's internal state with the phrase 'indicating a sense of contemplation or concern,' which is subjective. The description of his motion, 'walks slowly,' is too generic; the video actually shows him first standing still, then turning his head to scan the area from side to side, and only then beginning to walk with a slight shuffle, not just a slow walk. The caption also incorrectly focuses on describing the camera's movement and the static background rather than the subject's actions. A more accurate description would omit the subjective analysis and camera work, and instead chronologically detail the man's specific movements, such as him scanning the area before starting to shuffle forward and navigating around the pillars.",
