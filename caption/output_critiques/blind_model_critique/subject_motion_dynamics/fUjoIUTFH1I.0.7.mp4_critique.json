  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video scene: a wet street with parked cars and buildings. It also correctly identifies that the only motion present is the camera moving forward.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in that it describes the primary motion in the video (the camera's movement). However, it is overly complete in its description of the static environment, which violates the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption violates the instructions in the following ways:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Focus:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption does the opposite. The first two sentences are dedicated entirely to static details of the scene (\"empty street,\" \"parked cars,\" \"street is wet,\" \"classic architectural style,\" \"balconies and awnings\"). The motion is only mentioned in the final sentence.\n2.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'.\" The caption uses the phrase \"suggesting recent rain,\" which is a speculative conclusion, not a direct observation of motion.\n3.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses \"quiet\" and \"classic,\" which are subjective interpretations of the scene's atmosphere and architectural style.\n4.  **Inefficient Description for a Scenery Shot:** For a scenery shot with no moving subjects, the instructions state to \"briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" While the caption is three sentences, it fills them with forbidden static details, speculation, and subjective language. A compliant caption would be much more concise and focused only on the observed camera motion.\n\nA better caption, following all the instructions, would be:\n\n**The camera moves slowly forward along an empty, wet street lined with parked cars and buildings.**",
