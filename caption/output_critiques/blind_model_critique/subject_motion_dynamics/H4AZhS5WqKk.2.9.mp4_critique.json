    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A gray-blue cartoon cat, recognizable as Tom from the \"Tom and Jerry\" series, is the central subject, presented in a 2D animation style. The cat has a lighter gray-blue torso, a white muzzle, white paws, and pink inner ears. He is depicted standing on a bed, hunched over and holding a green bottle with a red and yellow patterned sticker featuring blue letters. The atypical appearance stems from the superimposition of this flat, animated character onto a photorealistic, three-dimensional bedroom scene, creating a stark contrast between the two visual styles.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological summary, but it lacks the dynamic detail that would be present in a cartoon video. The description of the motion is somewhat passive; for instance, \"causing the liquid inside to spray out\" could be improved by describing the action more vividly, such as \"a jet of liquid erupts from the bottle, launching the mouse.\" The term \"bounces back down\" is also vague; a more specific description like \"ricochets off the ceiling and plummets onto the bed\" would better illustrate the cartoon physics at play. Furthermore, the caption completely omits the cat's reaction to the event. In a cartoon, the cat would likely show surprise, duck to avoid the spray, or be knocked over by the force, and including this secondary motion would make the description more comprehensive. The end of the action feels abrupt, as it doesn't state where Jerry ultimately lands, which is a crucial final step in the sequence of movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The cartoon cat remains completely still on the bed, holding a bottle. Suddenly, a jet of liquid erupts from the bottle, launching the mouse into the air. The mouse ricochets off the ceiling and plummets back onto the bed. The cat, caught off guard, ducks to avoid the spray and is knocked over by the force. Finally, the mouse lands safely beside the cat, completing the chaotic sequence.",
