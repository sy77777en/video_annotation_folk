    "pre_caption": "A man energetically plays a drum set, raising his right arm high and bringing a drumstick down onto a cymbal. He then moves his head and upper body from side to side and forward, striking the cymbals with both drumsticks. He shouts and leans forward, continuing to play, then turns his head to the right and back to the front while still drumming.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with short, messy brown hair is energetically playing a drum set. He is wearing a light blue blazer over a white hoodie; the hoodie has the word \"HELLBOY\" printed in red letters within a red outlined box on the chest. He is shown shouting with an intense expression as he plays with drumsticks. Parts of the drum set are visible, including golden-bronze colored cymbals; one larger cymbal has \"PAISTE\" written on it in black lettering.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** A man energetically plays a drum set, raising his right arm high and bringing a drumstick down onto a cymbal. He then moves his head and upper body from side to side and forward, striking the cymbals with both drumsticks. He shouts and leans forward, continuing to play, then turns his head to the right and back to the front while still drumming.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nOverall, the caption is very good and adheres well to the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and focuses effectively on the subject's motion.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption describes a logical and plausible sequence of actions for someone playing the drums. The movements described (raising arms, striking cymbals, moving the head and body, shouting) are specific and accurately portray the physical actions involved in drumming.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is comprehensive, capturing multiple distinct movements of the man's arms, head, and upper body. It successfully details his interaction with the drum set, providing a full picture of the action in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at this. It uses phrases like \"then\" and structures the sentences to clearly present the actions in the sequence they occur.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The entire description is dedicated to the man's movements and his interaction with the instrument, correctly avoiding details about his appearance or the setting.\n    *   **Specificity:** It uses precise, descriptive language (e.g., \"raising his right arm high,\" \"bringing a drumstick down onto a cymbal,\" \"moves his head and upper body from side to side\") instead of generic phrases like \"he plays the drums.\"\n    *   **Object Interaction:** The interaction between the man, the drumsticks, and the cymbals is clearly and specifically described.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is easy to understand while remaining informative.\n    *   **No Speculation or Abstraction:** It avoids ambiguous or abstract language, sticking to concrete, observable actions.\n\n*   **Area for Minor Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The word \"**energetically**\" could be considered subjective, as it interprets the quality or mood of the action rather than just describing the motion itself. While the energy might be obvious from the video, a more objective alternative would be to describe the speed or force of the movements (e.g., \"rapidly,\" \"forcefully\") or to let the specific action descriptions (like \"raising his right arm high\") convey the energy on their own.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It follows nearly all instructions with a high degree of precision, particularly in its chronological structure and specific descriptions of motion. The only minor deviation is the use of the subjective adverb \"energetically,\" but this does not significantly detract from the overall quality and effectiveness of the description.",
