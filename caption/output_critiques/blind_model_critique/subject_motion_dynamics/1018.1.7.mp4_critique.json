    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a train corridor, wearing a green and red cap, a white shirt, and a dark vest with a tie. He has a mustache and is holding a small tree wrapped in netting. Behind him, another man is visible, wearing a Santa hat and a dark coat. The first man appears to be walking forward, with a focused expression, while the second man follows closely.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The caption dedicates the majority of its text to describing static details rather than motion. The first sentence is entirely about the man's appearance (\"green and red cap, a white shirt, and a dark vest with a tie\") and the object he is holding. The last sentence describes the background (\"interior of a train with light green walls and windows\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives\":** The caption uses the phrase \"with a determined expression,\" which is a subjective interpretation of the man's emotional state. This directly contradicts the instruction to avoid such language.\n\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** Due to the inclusion of excessive appearance and background details, the caption is not concise. The core motion could be described in a much shorter sentence.\n\n**In summary:** The caption is inaccurate in its adherence to the rules. While it correctly identifies the subjects and their basic movement, it violates the core principles of focusing strictly on motion, avoiding subjective language, and omitting descriptive details about appearance and setting.\n\nA better caption that follows the instructions would be:\n\nA man holding a small, netted tree walks forward through a train corridor, and a second man follows closely behind him.",
