    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video displays the Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" superimposed on a textured, rocky surface. The letters, initially appearing as dark, shadowy indentations on the stone, gradually illuminate to a bright, glowing white. The background surface exhibits a layered, uneven texture with varying shades of green, brown, and grey, suggesting a natural rock formation.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres to all the given instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the visual events in the video. It correctly identifies the subject as the Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" and details its transformation.\n*   **Completeness:** It provides a complete description of the primary action. It starts with the initial state of the letters (faint indentations) and follows them through to their final state (bright, glowing white), while also noting the static nature of the background for context.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The description is perfectly chronological, detailing how the letters \"start to become more distinct and illuminated, transitioning\" to their final state.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption correctly focuses on the \"motion\" of the subject, which in this case is the animation of the letters lighting up. It avoids unnecessary descriptions of the static background.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and forms a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It uses descriptive, objective words (\"faintly,\" \"distinct,\" \"illuminated,\" \"bright,\" \"glowing\") and avoids any subjective, emotional, or speculative language.\n    *   **Specificity:** The description is specific, explaining that the letters transition \"from a shadowy appearance to a bright, glowing white,\" which is much better than a generic phrase like \"the word lights up.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is precise, well-structured, and effectively communicates the essential action of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with the Greek word \"IIΑΧΩΝ\" subtly etched into a textured, rocky surface. As the video progresses, the letters gradually become more pronounced and illuminated, shifting from a shadowy form to a vibrant, glowing white. The background remains unchanged, highlighting the natural, uneven texture of the rock with its diverse shades of green, brown, and grey.",
