    "pre_caption": "A group of people, including men and women, are walking through a dimly lit tunnel with red lighting. As they continue walking, the light at the end of the tunnel gradually becomes brighter, transitioning from red to white. The group maintains a steady pace, and the increasing brightness of the light ahead becomes more pronounced. The tunnel's structure remains consistent, with metal walls and a ribbed ceiling, while the group moves closer to the bright light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a group of people walking through a tunnel. The individuals are mostly men, wearing casual clothing such as t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans. The lighting in the tunnel shifts from a dim red to a bright white, creating a dramatic contrast. The camera angle shows their backs as they walk towards a bright light at the end of the tunnel, emphasizing their movement and transition as the group progresses forward.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **good but could be improved.** It successfully follows several key instructions but deviates from others, particularly regarding focus and conciseness.\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible and coherent video scene. The sequence of events—a group walking through a tunnel toward a light that changes color and intensity—is logical and easy to visualize.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is complete in that it captures the primary motion of the subjects (walking at a steady pace) and the most significant environmental change that affects the scene (the light at the end of the tunnel becoming brighter and changing color).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence: the group walks in red light, the light ahead begins to brighten and turn white, and the group continues moving toward it.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"dimly lit,\" \"red lighting,\" \"bright light\" are descriptive, not emotional).\n*   **No Speculation:** The language is direct and avoids ambiguous or speculative phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Group Activity:** It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"group\" and describes their collective motion (\"walking,\" \"maintains a steady pace\").\n\n**Where the caption can be improved:**\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The instruction states to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption violates this by including several static details:\n    *   \"...including men and women...\" (describes the subjects' appearance, not their motion).\n    *   \"The tunnel's structure remains consistent, with metal walls and a ribbed ceiling...\" (describes the static environment, not the subjects' motion).\n*   **Conciseness:** By including the unnecessary static details mentioned above, the caption becomes less concise. Removing them would make the description more focused on the essential action as required by the instructions.\n*   **Repetitiveness:** The idea that the group is moving toward the light is mentioned twice: \"...the light at the end of the tunnel gradually becomes brighter...\" and \"...the group moves closer to the bright light.\" This could be streamlined into a single, more efficient sentence.\n\n**A revised caption that more closely follows all instructions would look like this:**\n\nA group of people walks at a steady pace through a dimly lit, red-lit tunnel. As they proceed, the light at the end of the tunnel grows in brightness and transitions from red to white. The group continues moving forward toward the increasingly bright exit.",
