    "pre_caption": "The woman stands on the stage, speaking while frequently gesturing with her left hand. She shifts her weight from one leg to the other and occasionally steps to the side as she continues to address the audience. Throughout the video, she maintains an upright posture and uses her hand movements to emphasize points during her speech.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A middle-aged woman with light skin and short, straight brown hair stands on a stage. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern that falls to her knees. She also wears black, knee-high boots and a necklace. She is actively speaking, gesturing with her left hand, and has an engaged expression on her face.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a series of movements—standing, speaking, gesturing, shifting weight, and stepping—that are characteristic of a person giving a presentation or speech on a stage. The description is plausible and internally consistent.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It captures not only the primary action (speaking) but also the secondary, supporting movements that provide a full picture of the subject's motion. It details the use of the left hand for gesturing, the subtle shifting of weight, and occasional side steps, creating a comprehensive description of the person's body language and movement throughout the video.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to the given instructions.\n\n*   **Chronological & Motion-Focused:** The actions described are ongoing and repetitive rather than a linear sequence. The caption correctly presents them as concurrent activities (\"speaking while frequently gesturing,\" \"continues to address\") that occur \"throughout the video.\" This is the correct approach for this type of non-sequential motion.\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The description is written in a single, coherent paragraph using simple, natural English. It is easy to read and understand.\n*   **Specificity:** It excels in providing specific details without being overly verbose. For example, it specifies \"gesturing with her left hand\" and \"shifts her weight from one leg to the other\" instead of just saying \"she moves around.\"\n*   **Avoids Prohibited Elements:**\n    *   **No Emotion/Subjectivity:** The caption is objective and avoids words like \"passionately,\" \"confidently,\" or \"nervously.\"\n    *   **No Speculation:** It avoids phrases like \"it seems\" or \"she might be.\" The statement \"uses her hand movements to emphasize points\" is a direct and reasonable description of the function of the motion in this context, not a speculative guess.\n    *   **No Abstract Descriptions:** It sticks to concrete actions (\"steps to the side\") rather than abstract interpretations (\"commands the stage\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, objective, and highly specific about the subject's motion.",
