    "pre_caption": "The woman stands on the stage, speaking while frequently gesturing with her left hand. She shifts her weight from one leg to the other and occasionally steps to the side as she continues to address the audience. Throughout the video, she maintains an upright posture and uses her hand movements to emphasize points during her speech.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A middle-aged woman with light skin and short, straight brown hair stands on a stage. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern that falls to her knees. She also wears black, knee-high boots and a necklace. She is actively speaking, gesturing with her left hand, and has an engaged expression on her face.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the subject's primary action of speaking on a stage but lacks specificity regarding her movements and interactions. For instance, it mentions she gestures with her left hand but fails to note that she is holding a microphone in her right hand, which would explain the one-handed gesturing. The description of her movement as \"shifts her weight\" and \"occasionally steps to the side\" is too general; a more accurate description might be that she paces from a lectern to the center of the stage and back. Furthermore, the caption omits a key interaction: the woman frequently turns and points with her left hand toward a large presentation screen behind her to highlight specific data points. The description also treats the video as a single continuous shot, whereas the video includes cuts, such as a transition from a medium shot of her pacing to a tight close-up on her face as she delivers a key message, which is a significant detail of the visual narrative that should be included.",
