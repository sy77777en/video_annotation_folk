    "pre_caption": "A person and two camels remain stationary in the desert as a blue car speeds across the sand dunes in the background, kicking up a trail of dust. The car then drifts around a dune, sending a large plume of sand into the air. The view shifts to a close-up, slow-motion shot of sand and small pieces of debris being thrown up and flying toward the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person, two camels, and a car. The person, dressed in dark blue or black clothing that covers their body and head, is sitting on the sand. Next to them, one light-brown camel stands with a dark pack on its back, while a second camel lies on the ground. A blue car speeds across the sand dunes, kicking up a large cloud of dust. The focus then shifts to a close-up, slow-motion view of the sand and small, dark pieces of debris being thrown into the air, flying directly toward the viewer.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological sequence of events and correctly identifies the shift to a slow-motion close-up. However, the description could be improved by leading with the primary action to create more immediate engagement. Starting with the stationary person and camels buries the main event—the car's dynamic movement. The phrase \"transitioning to the middleground as the camera moves\" is slightly vague; specifying the type of camera movement, such as \"as the camera pans to track its path,\" would provide a clearer visual. Furthermore, the description of the second shot feels disconnected from the first. While it correctly identifies the slow-motion sand, it fails to attribute this action back to the car. A more integrated description would explicitly state that the close-up shows the effect of the car's tires, for example, \"The view then cuts to a slow-motion close-up of the car's tires churning, spraying sand and debris toward the camera,\" which would create a more cohesive narrative linking the two distinct shots.",
