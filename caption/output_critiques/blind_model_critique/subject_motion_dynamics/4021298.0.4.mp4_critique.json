    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a camel lying on the ground, equipped with a colorful saddle blanket and a decorative red tassel on its head. The camera then starts to tilt upwards, gradually revealing another camel standing behind the first one. The standing camel is also equipped with a similar saddle blanket and is facing away from the camera. The background consists of a rocky cliff face and some scattered items, including a blue container and a yellow bag. The transition between the two camels is smooth, with the camera movement focusing on the standing camel as it becomes the main subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features three camels in a desert setting. The first camel, positioned prominently in the foreground, is lying down with a light brown coat and a decorative yellow and red tassel on its head. It is covered with multiple colorful blankets, featuring various shades and patterns. Initially visible on the left is another camel with a lighter coat, adorned with several colorful blankets. The camera tilts upwards to reveal the third camel, which is standing and facing away from the viewer, revealing its slender legs and a similar saddle blanket.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption focuses excessively on describing the camera's movement (\"The camera then starts to tilt upwards\") and static visual details (\"colorful saddle blanket,\" \"rocky cliff face,\" \"blue container\") rather than the motion of the subjects themselves, which is the primary instruction. While the video may feature a camera tilt, the description should prioritize what the camels are doing. For instance, the lying camel might be chewing or blinking, and the standing camel could be swishing its tail or turning its head slightly. These subtle actions are crucial for a motion description. If the camels are completely motionless, the caption should state that directly. The current text describes the cinematography of a reveal rather than the subjects' actions, and the detailed list of background objects and equipment is superfluous to a description focused on movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up of a camel lying on the ground, gently chewing and occasionally blinking. Behind it, another camel stands, swishing its tail and turning its head slightly. The background features a rocky cliff face, but the focus remains on the subtle movements of the camels, highlighting their calm and relaxed demeanor.",
