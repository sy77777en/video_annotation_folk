    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person wearing a dark spacesuit with a helmet that has a clear visor. The helmet reflects light, revealing the person's face inside, which appears focused and intent. The spacesuit is detailed with various panels and fastenings, suggesting a high-tech design. The person is oriented slightly to the side, with their head turned to the right, indicating attentiveness to something outside the frame. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that accentuate the contours of the suit and helmet.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**1. Violation of \"No Speculation or Subjective Language\":**\nThe instruction explicitly states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n*   **The caption violates this rule** with the phrase \"...suggesting a state of alertness or contemplation.\" This is a subjective interpretation of the subject's internal state, not an objective description of their motion.\n\n**2. Violation of \"Focus on Motion, Not Description\":**\nThe instruction directs, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\"\n*   **The caption violates this rule** by dedicating its first sentence to describing the subject's appearance and the setting: \"a person in a spacesuit with a helmet, standing in a dimly lit environment with blurred lights in the background.\" Since there is only one subject, these details are unnecessary and shift the focus away from motion.\n\n**3. Violation of \"No Introductory Text\":**\nThe instruction asks to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n*   **The caption violates this rule** by starting with the phrase \"The video shows...\". This is unnecessary introductory text.\n\n**4. Incomplete Adherence to \"Describe Motion\":**\nWhile the caption does mention \"slight movements of the head and body,\" it could be more specific. A better caption would omit the speculative and descriptive parts and focus solely on the observable movement.\n\n**A better caption, following all instructions, would look like this:**\n\nA person in a spacesuit stands mostly stationary, making slight movements with their head and body.",
