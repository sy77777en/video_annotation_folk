    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A small red panda with reddish-brown fur and a bushy ringed tail is visible through a rectangular window, though its features are somewhat obscured by the glass and reflections. As the view shifts, two adults appear, dressed in casual clothing of various colors and styles, both standing. The red panda remains inside its enclosure, separated from the visitors, while the two adults are looking down at something in their hands, rather than observing the animal or the zoo environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a high-quality description that accurately and objectively captures the scene while adhering strictly to all the provided instructions.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It describes a static scene, correctly identifying the subjects (one red panda, two adults) and their positions relative to the enclosure. It precisely notes the lack of movement from the main subject and the specific, non-interactive posture of the secondary subjects.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete. It accounts for all salient subjects in the video and describes their state or subtle actions (standing, looking down). By mentioning the lack of interaction, it provides a full picture of the relationships within the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet provides all the essential information about what is (and is not) happening.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** This rule is not applicable as the subjects are stationary, and the caption correctly presents the scene as a static moment.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption perfectly follows this rule by explicitly stating the red panda \"remains stationary\" and is \"without any noticeable movement.\" It also describes the adults' static action of \"stand[ing].\"\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is exemplary in its objectivity. It avoids emotional words (e.g., \"bored,\" \"sad\"), subjective adjectives, and speculative phrases. Describing what the adults are looking at as \"something in their hands\" is a perfect example of avoiding uncertain claims.\n    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, creating a clear and coherent description.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It correctly identifies the red panda as the primary subject and the adults as secondary, describing the main subject first and then briefly detailing the others.\n    *   **Interaction:** It clearly and correctly states that the subjects are \"not interacting with the red panda or each other,\" which is a key detail about their relative motion and relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is precise, objective, and well-structured, successfully describing a scene with minimal action in a way that is both informative and compliant with all constraints.",
