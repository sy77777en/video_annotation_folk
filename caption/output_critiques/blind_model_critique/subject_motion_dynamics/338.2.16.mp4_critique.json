    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with medium skin tone and straight, shoulder-length dark hair. She is wearing large, polygonal glasses and a teal hoodie. Her expression is calm and slightly smiling. Initially, her head is turned to her right before she turns to face forward. She appears relaxed and is the central focus of the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a woman and accurately describes her sequence of movements: looking to the right, smiling, and then turning her head forward.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption completely covers the subject's primary motions from the beginning to the end of the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows some instructions well but deviates from others.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in the order they occur: \"initially looks to her right and smiles. She then gradually turns her head to face forward...\"\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** It does not use ambiguous or speculative phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Specific Actions:** It uses specific descriptions of motion, such as \"gradually turns her head.\"\n\n**Where the caption could be improved:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The first sentence, \"The background includes a framed picture on the left and two decorative plates on the right, all set against a patterned wallpaper,\" describes the static background. The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion\" and avoid describing details not related to movement. This entire sentence should be removed.\n*   **Unnecessary Appearance Details:** The caption mentions the woman is \"dressed in a teal hoodie.\" Since she is the only subject, this detail is not needed to differentiate her from others and should be omitted as per the instruction to \"Avoid describing the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\"\n*   **Describing State vs. Motion:** The phrase \"maintaining a calm expression\" describes a state rather than a physical action. While \"smiles\" is an action, \"calm expression\" is an interpretation. A better caption would stick strictly to observable movements.\n\n**A revised caption that more closely follows all instructions would be:**\n\nThe woman initially looks to her right and smiles, then she gradually turns her head to face forward.",
