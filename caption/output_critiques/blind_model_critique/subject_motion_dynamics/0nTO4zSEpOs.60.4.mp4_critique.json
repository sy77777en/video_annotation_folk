    "pre_caption": "The video shows a nighttime urban scene with a modern building featuring the 'GMO' logo in the background, illuminated by various lights. Several people are walking on a tiled pedestrian bridge, with some moving towards the camera and others away from it. The camera gradually moves to the right, capturing more of the scene and the people walking. The background includes tall buildings with bright advertisements and signs, adding to the bustling city atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Failure to Focus on Motion:** The caption dedicates a significant portion of its text to describing static background elements (\"a nighttime urban scene,\" \"a modern building featuring the 'GMO' logo,\" \"tiled pedestrian bridge,\" \"tall buildings with bright advertisements and signs\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Language:** The caption uses the phrase \"bustling city atmosphere,\" which is an emotional and subjective interpretation. The instructions clearly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n\n*   **Generic Motion Description:** The phrase \"Several people are walking\" is a generic description. The instructions require more specific language, specifying *how* subjects move. While it adds directional detail (\"towards the camera and others away from it\"), the core action is not described with the requested specificity.\n\n*   **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is introductory text that the instructions direct you to avoid. The final output should be only the description itself.\n\nWhile the caption does correctly identify the camera's movement and presents actions in a somewhat chronological order, its significant deviations from the core instructions regarding focus, objectivity, and specificity make it a poor example.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "People stride briskly across a pedestrian bridge, some approaching the camera while others recede into the distance. The camera pans right, revealing a dynamic flow of movement against a backdrop of illuminated urban architecture and vibrant advertisements.",
