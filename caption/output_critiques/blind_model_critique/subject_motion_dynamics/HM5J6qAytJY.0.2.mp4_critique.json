    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video shows a first-person perspective from inside a race car, looking out the front windshield. A person's arms, clad in a white racing suit and white gloves with black accents, are visible holding a black, yoke-style racing steering wheel. The steering wheel has a silver Mercedes-Benz logo at its center and is equipped with numerous multi-colored buttons and dials. The car's interior is stripped down, featuring a white structural roll cage with crisscrossing bars on both the left and right sides. A small digital display screen, showing vehicle data, is mounted on the dashboard in the center. Through the windshield, a paved road stretches forward through a flat, arid landscape with mountains visible in the distance under a clear sky, illuminated by the golden light of a sun low on the horizon.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly establishes the first-person perspective and the basic chronological order of the car's movement. However, it lacks the dynamism and specificity seen in the video. The description \"navigates a straight track\" is too passive; the video shows the car accelerating aggressively, with the speedometer climbing and the engine noise intensifying. When approaching the curve, the caption omits the crucial action of the driver braking hard before initiating the turn, a motion clearly indicated by the forward pitch of the car. While it mentions the driver turning the wheel, it fails to describe the car's resulting motion of gripping the track and hugging the inside apex of the corner. The phrase \"desert landscape passing by\" also understates the visual effect of speed; in the video, the trackside markers and desert scrub are a blur, conveying a much higher velocity than the caption suggests.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective inside a race car, the driver aggressively accelerates along the track, the speedometer climbing rapidly as the engine roars with intensity. As the car approaches a curve, the driver brakes hard, causing the vehicle to pitch forward before expertly steering into the turn. The car grips the track tightly, hugging the inside apex of the corner with precision. The desert landscape and trackside markers blur past, emphasizing the high velocity and dynamic motion of the race.",
