    "pre_caption": "A silver car, initially parked in the midground, flashes its taillights before driving forward and turning left, moving away from the camera. A dark grey car then enters the frame from the right and drives forward, following the silver car's path and positioning itself behind it. Throughout the video, two people remain crouched on the ground to the left, and a portion of another car on the far right remains stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a silver Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R driving out of a parking spot in the midground, its iconic round taillights glowing red. To the left, two people wearing dark clothing are crouched on the ground, illuminated by a bright blue light emitted from the headlights of the previous car. A dark grey Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R with white, multi-spoke wheels then enters the frame from the right, following the silver car. On the far right, the rear portion of another dark grey, wide-body car remains stationary throughout the clip.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good chronological account of the main actions, but it could be more specific about the quality and timing of the movements. The phrase \"drives forward\" is generic; in the video, the cars appear to move very slowly and deliberately, almost as if they are being carefully positioned for a scene, so describing them as \"crawling\" or \"rolling slowly\" would be more accurate. The caption also misses the nuance of the interaction between the two cars; the dark grey car doesn't just follow, it waits until the silver car has almost completed its right turn before it begins to move from its starting position, suggesting a coordinated, sequential departure. Furthermore, while the two people on the left are correctly described as crouched, the video shows one of them looking up and tracking the silver car's movement with their head, a small but significant action that provides context to their presence. Finally, the phrase \"positioning itself behind it\" is slightly redundant after stating that it \"follows the silver car's path.\" A more precise description would focus on the specific manner of movement and the timing of the interaction between the subjects.",

A dark grey car then enters the frame from the right, rolling slowly as it waits for the silver car to nearly complete its turn before beginning its own deliberate movement, suggesting a coordinated, sequential departure. Throughout the video, two people remain crouched on the ground to the left; one of them looks up, tracking the silver car's movement with their head. Meanwhile, a portion of another car on the far right remains stationary.",
