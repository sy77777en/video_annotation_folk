    "pre_caption": "A silver car, initially parked in the midground, flashes its taillights before driving forward and turning left, moving away from the camera. A dark grey car then enters the frame from the right and drives forward, following the silver car's path and positioning itself behind it. Throughout the video, two people remain crouched on the ground to the left, and a portion of another car on the far right remains stationary.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a silver Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R driving out of a parking spot in the midground, its iconic round taillights glowing red. To the left, two people wearing dark clothing are crouched on the ground, illuminated by a bright blue light emitted from the headlights of the previous car. A dark grey Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R with white, multi-spoke wheels then enters the frame from the right, following the silver car. On the far right, the rear portion of another dark grey, wide-body car remains stationary throughout the clip.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption describes a clear and logical sequence of events. The actions of the two cars are distinct and their interaction is described plausibly. The description of the static subjects provides a complete and accurate picture of the scene.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It addresses the motion of the primary subjects (the two cars) in detail and also accounts for the secondary subjects (the crouched people and the stationary car) by noting their lack of movement. It successfully captures all salient activity and inactivity in the frame.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption meticulously follows all the given rules:\n    *   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly sequences the events using words like \"initially,\" \"before,\" and \"then.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It uses specific, descriptive verbs for motion (\"flashes its taillights,\" \"driving forward and turning left,\" \"enters the frame,\" \"following the... path,\" \"positioning itself\") and correctly notes the lack of motion for other subjects (\"remain crouched,\" \"remains stationary\").\n    *   **Concise and Objective:** The description is clear, to the point, and avoids subjective or emotional language (e.g., \"quickly,\" \"cautiously\"). It also avoids speculative phrases like \"it appears.\"\n    *   **Subject Differentiation:** It appropriately uses appearance (\"silver car,\" \"dark grey car\") solely to distinguish between the two main subjects.\n    *   **Subject Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction between the two cars (\"following the silver car's path and positioning itself behind it\").\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph as requested.",
