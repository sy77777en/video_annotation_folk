    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A Black woman with a muscular build is shown performing a gymnastics routine. Her long, black hair is styled in a high ponytail. She is dressed in a grey sports bra and black shorts, and she wears small white earbuds. Throughout the sequence, she is seen in various dynamic poses, flipping through the air.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a basic chronological sequence, but it likely oversimplifies the action and misses key details that would be visible in the video. The term \"three forward rolls\" is probably inaccurate for an \"intricate gymnastics routine,\" as this describes a very basic skill; the gymnast is more likely performing a complex tumbling pass, such as a series of connected front handsprings or front tucks. The caption fails to describe the movements connecting these tumbling elements, such as the preparatory run-up, a round-off, or any interspersed dance choreography. Furthermore, the description of the conclusion is generic. Instead of just \"landing on a blue mat,\" a more precise caption would describe the quality of the landing—for example, if she \"sticks the landing without taking a step\" or \"takes a small hop backward to control her momentum.\" Similarly, \"raising her arms to finish\" could be improved by describing the specific final pose, such as \"snapping into a final pose with arms extended overhead.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The gymnast begins her routine with a powerful run-up, seamlessly transitioning into a round-off. She launches into a series of connected front handsprings, showcasing her agility and strength. Mid-air, she executes a complex front tuck, maintaining perfect form. As she descends, she sticks the landing on the blue mat with precision, not taking a single step. To conclude her routine, she snaps into a final pose, arms extended overhead, exuding confidence and grace.",
