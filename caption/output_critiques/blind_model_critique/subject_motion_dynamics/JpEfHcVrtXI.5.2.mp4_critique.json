    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A large, rotund, dark purple creature with a bear-like form carries a small, white, spirit-like creature on its back. The smaller creature is luminous, with a slender body, long, pointed ears, and thin limbs, giving it a delicate, ethereal appearance. The larger creature has a bulky, rounded physique and small, dark eyes, contrasting with the bright, glowing form of its passenger.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible scene involving two distinct subjects. It specifies their actions (walking, carrying, swaying, bobbing) and their relationship to each other and the environment (one on the other's back, crossing a wooden structure).\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive. It doesn't just state that a creature is walking; it elaborates on the *quality* of the motion (\"sways from side to side,\" \"slow, deliberate steps\"). It also completely describes the motion of the secondary subject (\"remains seated, bobbing gently in sync\"), fulfilling the requirement to describe interactions between subjects.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given rules perfectly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, clear paragraph that effectively conveys the essential motion.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The action described is continuous and presented logically.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on how the subjects move. Appearance details (\"large, dark purple,\" \"small, white, glowing\") are used appropriately to differentiate the two subjects, as permitted by the instructions.\n*   **Objective and Factual:** It avoids speculation (\"appears to be\"), emotional language, and abstract descriptions (\"emphasizing its power\"). The phrase \"deliberate steps\" is a descriptive observation of the pace and placement of the feet, not a subjective judgment.\n*   **Specific Actions:** It uses precise verbs and descriptors like \"walks,\" \"carrying,\" \"sways,\" \"takes... steps,\" and \"bobbing,\" which are much more descriptive than generic terms.\n*   **Subject Interaction:** The interaction is clearly defined: the large creature carries the small one, and the small one's movement is a direct result of the larger one's gait.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is clear, objective, detailed, and focuses squarely on describing the subjects' motion in a specific and easy-to-understand manner.",
