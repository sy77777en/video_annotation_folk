    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room with a plain background, a group of people are seated on high chairs arranged in a curved line, facing away from the camera. They begin to turn their bodies to the right, gradually shifting their positions. As they continue to turn, their hands move in a synchronized manner, possibly clapping or gesturing. The group completes their turn, now facing more towards the right side of the frame, with their hands still in motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the setting and the primary motion of the subjects turning in their chairs. However, the phrase \"**possibly** clapping or gesturing\" introduces speculation, which makes the description less accurate. The instructions require describing only what is visible and certain.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption provides a good chronological overview of the group's main action (turning). It successfully captures the beginning, middle, and end of the turn. However, the description of the hand movement is incomplete because it offers two ambiguous options (\"clapping or gesturing\") instead of a specific description of the motion itself.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres well to several key instructions:\n*   It correctly presents the actions in **chronological order**.\n*   It focuses on the **subjects' motion** (turning, hand movements).\n*   It uses simple, natural English and avoids emotional or subjective language.\n*   It correctly describes a **group activity** with synchronized movements.\n\nHowever, the caption fails on one critical instruction:\n*   It violates the rule: \"**Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'**\" The phrase \"**possibly** clapping **or** gesturing\" is a clear example of both speculation (\"possibly\") and an ambiguous option (\"A or B\"). A better approach would be to describe the visible hand motion without labeling the action if it's unclear (e.g., \"their hands move up and down in unison\") or to state the action definitively if it is clear (e.g., \"their hands move in a synchronized clapping motion\").",
