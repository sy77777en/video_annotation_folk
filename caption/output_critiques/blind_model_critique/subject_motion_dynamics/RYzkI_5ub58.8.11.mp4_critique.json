    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a high-quality description that successfully adheres to nearly all the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, objective, and motion-focused narrative.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It uses descriptive details (\"large, dark fish,\" \"smaller, silver fish\") appropriately to differentiate between the subjects, which is essential for understanding their interaction.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a complete and self-contained description of the motion. It establishes the initial state (large fish swimming, surrounded by the school), describes the key interaction (the school parting and re-forming), and concludes with the ongoing collective movement of the smaller fish. It effectively captures the entire sequence of events.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels here. It presents the actions in a clear, logical sequence: the large fish swims forward -> the school parts -> the school swarms around it.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on movement. It uses strong, specific verbs like \"swims slowly,\" \"parts,\" \"pass through,\" \"swarms,\" and \"swim in various directions\" to create a vivid picture of the action.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that conveys the essential information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objectivity (No Emotional/Subjective Adjectives):** The caption is largely objective. Words like \"vast\" and \"dynamic\" are on the borderline, but in this context, they function as descriptive quantifiers of scale and movement rather than subjective emotional judgments. \"Dynamic, swirling pattern\" is a factual description of a complex, changing movement, not an opinion on its quality.\n*   **Certainty (No Speculative Language):** The caption uses definitive language and avoids any speculation, as instructed. There are no instances of \"appears to be\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Specificity of Actions and Interactions:** This is a major strength of the caption.\n    *   **Individual Action:** \"A large, dark fish swims slowly forward\" is specific.\n    *   **Interaction:** \"The school of fish parts to allow the larger fish to pass through\" is a perfect example of describing an interaction with clarity.\n    *   **Group Activity:** \"swarms around it\" and \"swim in various directions, creating a dynamic, swirling pattern\" are excellent descriptions of collective behavior.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption avoids abstract interpretations. It describes the \"swirling pattern\" as a result of the fish's movement, which is a direct observation, not an abstract concept like \"emphasizing its power.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, concise, and focuses precisely on describing the subjects' motion and interaction in a chronological and objective manner. It is an excellent caption for the video.",
