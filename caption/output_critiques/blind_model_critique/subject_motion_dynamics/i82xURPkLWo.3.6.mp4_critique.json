    "pre_caption": "The man, wearing a brown t-shirt, is seated in front of a wooden wall with a window in the background. He begins speaking, and his facial expression changes slightly as he talks. He then raises his right hand to rub his nose bridge, indicating a moment of contemplation or emphasis in his speech. After rubbing his nose, he continues to speak, maintaining a thoughtful expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a darker skin tone, a buzz cut hairstyle, and a neatly trimmed goatee. He is wearing a brown t-shirt and is seated, facing slightly to his left. His expression changes as he speaks, transitioning from a subtle smile to a more contemplative look, while he appears to be looking slightly downward. The setting suggests a relaxed, informal environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to accurately describe a sequence of events that could occur in a video. The actions (speaking, rubbing nose, speaking again) are plausible and described in a logical order.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a chronologically complete description of the subject's primary movements. It starts with the initial action and follows through to the end of the described sequence.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates multiple core instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The first sentence, \"The man, wearing a brown t-shirt, is seated in front of a wooden wall with a window in the background,\" is almost entirely dedicated to static details (clothing, posture, background). The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to avoid unnecessary appearance details.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculative Statements\":** The phrase **\"indicating a moment of contemplation or emphasis in his speech\"** is a direct violation of this rule. It interprets the *meaning* or *intent* behind the action rather than simply describing the physical motion. The instructions clearly state to \"Avoid speculative statements\" and \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives\":** The caption uses the word **\"thoughtful\"** to describe the man's expression. This is a subjective interpretation of his internal state, not a neutral description of his physical facial movements.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Unnecessary Appearance Details\":** Mentioning the \"brown t-shirt\" is an unnecessary detail, as the instructions specify not to describe appearance unless it's needed to differentiate between multiple subjects.",
