    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A pixelated, humanoid character is depicted wearing attire resembling warrior armor, featuring a long, bright red coat with yellow trim and cuffs.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the chronological sequence of events but lacks specificity in describing the character's motion. The terms \"moves to the right\" and \"navigates the environment\" are too generic; the video likely shows a more distinct form of movement, such as the character running, sprinting, or dashing. The description of \"navigates\" is particularly vague and fails to capture the specific actions involved, such as jumping over a chasm, sliding under an obstacle, or climbing a wall, which would be visible. Furthermore, the caption misses a potential cause-and-effect relationship: after the HUD icon flashes, the character might immediately use the newly available ability, such as performing a powered-up jump or a forward dash. Describing this specific action would provide a much clearer picture of the gameplay than the redundant and non-descriptive phrase \"navigates the environment to the right.\"",

Afterward, the character swings from the chain, releasing to land on a lower platform. Next, the character sprints to the right, pauses briefly, and interacts with a glowing object, causing it to emit a burst of light. Immediately after, the character performs a powered-up jump, clearing a chasm and continuing to the right by sliding under an obstacle and climbing a wall, showcasing dynamic movement through the environment.",
