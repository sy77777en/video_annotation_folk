    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens with a fast-moving aerial shot flying along the sharp ridge of a reddish-brown mountain. As the camera moves forward toward the peak against a bright sun, a lone figure is revealed standing at the summit. The camera then quickly moves toward and around this person, showing a man wearing a bright red jacket with a yellow hood or hat and green or brown pants. A backpack is visible on the ground near him as he stands on the mountaintop.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events, likely from a drone or first-person-view (FPV) camera. It correctly identifies the camera's point of view as the primary moving subject and the person as a stationary element.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the entire motion from the initial flight along the ridge to the final pivot around the person. It accounts for both the moving camera and the static human subject.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows the chronological flow of events: 1) The camera flies along the ridge, 2) it ascends and reveals the person, and 3) it moves toward and pivots around the person.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on motion. It uses specific, active verbs to describe the camera's movement (\"flies at high speed,\" \"moves forward and ascends,\" \"rapidly moves toward,\" \"pivots around\") and clearly states the person's lack of motion (\"standing still,\" \"stationary\").\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is a single, coherent unit that conveys the essential action without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objectivity and Specificity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"breathtaking,\" \"majestic\") and speculative language (\"it seems,\" \"might be\"). The descriptions are concrete and specific (e.g., \"pivots around the stationary person\" instead of \"looks at the person\").\n*   **Handling of Subjects and Reveals:** It correctly identifies the camera's motion as the main focus, describes the secondary subject (the person) concisely, and explicitly notes the moment the person \"is revealed.\"\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to describing the physical movement without interpreting its meaning or effect (e.g., it doesn't say \"emphasizing the person's solitude\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera swiftly glides along the sharp ridge of a mountain, ascending toward the peak. As it progresses, a person standing still at the summit comes into view. The camera then accelerates toward the person, circling around them as they gaze out over the landscape.",
