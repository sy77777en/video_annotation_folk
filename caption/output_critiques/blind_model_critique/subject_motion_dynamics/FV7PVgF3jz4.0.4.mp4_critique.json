    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Several people are seen from behind, seated in red theater chairs and facing a stage. One man has short, graying hair and wears a dark suit jacket. A young man with fair skin, dark curly hair, and a mustache, dressed in a black turtleneck and a matching jacket, walks onto the stage. He stands behind a small table and picks up a golden-colored statuette with an abstract design that is already on the table after the audience starts to applaud. As the audience members, whose hands are briefly visible, applaud, the young man smiles slightly before walking away with his award.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a clear, logical sequence of events that are specific and verifiable within a video (walking from behind a curtain, standing at a table, picking up a statuette, smiling, and exiting). It avoids making any assumptions or describing things that are not explicitly stated as being visible.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe description is complete, covering the subject's entire journey from the moment he appears on stage to the moment he leaves. It successfully captures all the key movements and interactions in a single, coherent narrative.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the rules:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** Perfect. The actions are listed in the exact sequence they occur: walks on -> stands -> picks up -> holds and smiles -> turns and walks off.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** Excellent. The description is built around action verbs (\"walks,\" \"stands,\" \"picks up,\" \"holds,\" \"turning\") that precisely describe the subject's movements.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids emotional or subjective language. \"Smiles slightly\" is a factual description of a facial movement, not a subjective interpretation of the subject's feelings (e.g., \"smiles happily\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It provides all essential information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Object Interaction:** The interaction with the \"golden statuette\" and the \"table\" is described clearly and specifically (\"picks up a golden statuette from the table,\" \"walking off the stage with it\").\n*   **Avoidance of Redundancy:** The only minor point for consideration is the inclusion of \"A young man with curly hair.\" The instructions state to avoid repeating details from subject descriptions. If \"young man with curly hair\" is already listed as a subject, this part is technically redundant. A stricter adherence would begin with \"The man walks...\". However, this is a very minor issue and does not detract from the overall high quality of the caption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example of how to follow the instructions. It is clear, concise, accurate, and focuses effectively on describing motion in chronological order. It serves as a great model for the desired output.",
