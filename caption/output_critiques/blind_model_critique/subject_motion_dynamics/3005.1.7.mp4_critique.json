    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young man of East Asian descent with short, dark hair is shown in a close-up, looking slightly up and to his right. He is wearing a light-colored jacket with a dark collar and dark detailing on the shoulders. Behind him and to his left, another young man, also of East Asian descent with short, dark hair and wearing a similar jacket, is partially visible and looking forward. Further in the background and to the far left, a third young man with short, dark hair and a darker complexion is seen in profile, also wearing a similar dark top. Due to the shallow depth of field, the faces of the other individuals appear in soft focus and are only briefly visible due to their positions and the camera framing.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is that it is too speculative and lacks detail regarding the subjects' motion. The phrase \"appear to be\" violates the instruction to avoid uncertainty. The description also focuses on the camera's movement (\"slowly dollies in\") rather than the subjects' actions, which should be the primary focus. The action itself, \"taking a step backward,\" is overly simplistic and uninformative. For example, if the video shows the three men reacting to something with surprise, a better caption would describe the quality of that movement. It fails to specify if the step is synchronized, staggered, or if they stumble. It also misses other potential movements, such as if they flinch, raise their hands defensively, or turn their heads in unison as they step back. A more effective description would state the action definitively and provide more context, such as, \"Three men standing in a line simultaneously jolt and take a quick step backward, all looking toward the left of the frame.\"",
