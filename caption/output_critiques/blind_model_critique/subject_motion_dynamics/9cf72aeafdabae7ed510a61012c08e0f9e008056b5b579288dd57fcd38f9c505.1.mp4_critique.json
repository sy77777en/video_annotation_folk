    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A mixed gray-brown squirrel with a white underside and a large, bushy tail is shown on top of a rough, bark-covered wooden post. Initially, the squirrel sits upright with its front paws held together near its chest. It then leans forward, turns back, and begins to climb headfirst down the side of the post, gripping the bark with its claws as its tail rests on the top, surrounding the opposite side of the trunk.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It describes a very specific and plausible sequence of actions for a squirrel. The details, such as sitting upright, holding its paws, climbing headfirst, gripping with claws, and the position of the tail, are precise and observable, suggesting a faithful representation of the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It covers the entire arc of the subject's motion within the clip, from a static position to the initiation and execution of the climb. It successfully creates a full narrative of the action in a single, coherent sentence.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the chronological flow of events: \"sits upright,\" \"then leans forward,\" and \"begins to climb.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely focused on the squirrel's movements and changes in posture, successfully avoiding static descriptions of its appearance.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses strong, specific verbs and descriptive phrases (\"sits upright,\" \"climb headfirst,\" \"gripping the bark with its claws\") instead of generic terms.\n*   **Object Interaction:** The interaction with the \"wooden post\" is clearly described (\"sits upright on,\" \"climb headfirst down the side of\").\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, forming a concise yet informative paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It strictly avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"cautiously,\" \"it seems to be\").\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, providing a description that is accurate, complete, specific, and perfectly aligned with all the stylistic and content requirements.",
