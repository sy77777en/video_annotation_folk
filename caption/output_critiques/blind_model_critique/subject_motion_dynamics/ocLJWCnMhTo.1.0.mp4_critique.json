    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man wearing a light-colored short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and black shoes is depicted suspended above a coffee table on a black-and-white checkered floor. His arms are raised with his hands open. Throughout the grainy video, bright, swirling orange lines of light move erratically around and over his body. The camera's perspective changes, shifting from a side view to a bird's-eye view of the man.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological order of the camera's crane movement and correctly identifies the main subject and the light effect. However, the description of the subject's state as \"calmly\" is subjective; a more objective term like \"motionless\" or \"still\" would be better, and the caption misses the opportunity to note subtle movements, such as the rise and fall of his chest as he breathes. The description of the light as \"continuously and erratically swirl[ing]\" is too general. A more specific description of the light's behavior would be more effective—for instance, you could describe if the lines of light are thin like lasers or thick like ribbons of energy, and whether they trace the contours of his body or move in a more chaotic, independent pattern. Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the interaction between the light and the man; it doesn't specify if the light illuminates his skin, casts shadows, or appears to pass through him as a purely graphical overlay, which is a key detail in understanding the nature of the visual effect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man lies motionless on his back with his arms raised, his chest subtly rising and falling as he breathes. The camera's perspective shifts, panning and tilting from a side view to a high-angle, top-down shot. Throughout the scene, bright orange lines of light, thin like lasers, swirl around and over his body, tracing the contours of his form in a chaotic, independent pattern. The light interacts with the man by illuminating his skin and casting dynamic shadows, enhancing the visual effect.",
