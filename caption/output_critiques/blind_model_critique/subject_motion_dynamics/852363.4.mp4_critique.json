    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man with a light skin tone and short, dark hair, facing the camera with a wide, open-mouthed expression.

The man's expression remains consistent throughout the video, indicating he might be speaking or reacting to something.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a light skin tone and short, dark hair. He is facing the camera with a wide, open-mouthed expression, suggesting he might be speaking or reacting to something. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on his face, and there are small, bright lights visible in the background, possibly indicating a nighttime setting. The man's facial features are partially obscured by the low light, but his expression remains the focal point throughout the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. It fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes the static visual elements of the video (a man with an open mouth, a dark background with lights). However, the statement \"indicating he might be speaking or reacting to something\" is a speculative interpretation, not a factual description of the video's content.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is incomplete because it does not clearly state the most important piece of information regarding motion: that there is none. The instruction states, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The caption implies this but does not state it directly as the primary point.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The primary instruction is to describe the subject's motion. The caption does the opposite, focusing almost entirely on the subject's static appearance (\"man with a light skin tone and short, dark hair,\" \"wide, open-mouthed expression\") and the background. This violates the rule: \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculation\":** The caption uses the phrase \"indicating he might be speaking or reacting to something.\" This is a direct violation of the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n*   **Violation of \"Concise Description of No Movement\":** Instead of simply stating that the subject is static, the caption buries this fact within a longer, descriptive sentence about the man's expression. A correct caption would have stated this more directly.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it focuses on appearance instead of motion and includes prohibited speculation. A correct caption, following the instructions, would be something like: \"A man remains stationary, facing forward with a fixed, open-mouthed expression throughout the video.\"",
