    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young woman with light skin and blonde hair tied in a messy bun runs away from the camera toward a pile of blue mats in the background. She is wearing a black leotard with a cutout on the back. In the foreground, a line of several other young female gymnasts of various skin tones stands watching her. The first girl in the line has a ponytail and long, dark brown hair, wearing a red leotard. Next to her, a girl with light brown hair in a ponytail wears a purple and pink leotard with black letters along the entire leotard. The third girl in line has dark brown hair and is dressed in a green leotard with a gold waistband. The other girls in the line are visible behind them, all wearing different colored leotards and standing with their arms by their sides or crossed.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject's direction of movement and the secondary subjects' reaction, but it lacks specificity regarding the gymnastic action. The term \"runs\" is too generic; in the video, the gymnast likely performs a powerful, purposeful sprint, such as a run-up for a vault or a tumbling pass. The description also feels incomplete as it ends with her \"receding into the background,\" which describes a camera effect rather than the subject's motion. A gymnast's run is a preparatory action, and the video almost certainly shows what it leads to, such as launching off a springboard, initiating a series of flips, or performing a leap. Including the culmination of the run would provide a more complete and informative description of the motion. Additionally, describing the other gymnasts as \"stationary\" while also \"turning their bodies\" is slightly contradictory; a more concise phrasing like \"other gymnasts wait in line, turning to watch\" would be more accurate.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A young gymnast in a black leotard sprints purposefully down a long corridor in a gymnasium, preparing for a vault.
