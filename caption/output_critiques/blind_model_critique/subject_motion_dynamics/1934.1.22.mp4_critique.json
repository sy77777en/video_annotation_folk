    "pre_caption": "The young man, standing on a black platform, begins to step down onto a white ledge. He continues to move forward on the ledge, maintaining his balance. The young man then crouches down and starts to lower himself. He carefully maneuvers himself off the ledge, using his hands for support. The young man swings his legs over the edge and lands on the ground below. He stands up and looks forward, completing his descent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young man dressed in white attire with orange stripes, including a long-sleeved shirt, pants, gloves, and a cap, with a light skin tone.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption describes a clear and logical sequence of movements. Each action flows chronologically and realistically into the next, accurately depicting a person carefully descending from a height.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very thorough. It captures the entire motion from the starting position on the platform to the final action of standing on the ground. It successfully includes key intermediate steps like crouching, using hands for support, and swinging the legs, which are essential for understanding the full scope of the movement.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels here. It presents the actions in a perfect step-by-step sequence: \"begins to step,\" \"continues to move,\" \"then crouches,\" \"maneuvers himself off,\" \"swings his legs,\" \"lands,\" and \"stands up.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely focused on the subject's motion, using strong, specific verbs (crouches, maneuvers, swings, lands) rather than generic ones.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is objective and avoids emotional or speculative language. The use of \"carefully\" is acceptable as it describes the *manner* of the motion (slow and controlled) rather than imputing an emotional state to the subject.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is written in simple, natural English, forming a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to understand. It provides sufficient detail without being overly wordy.\n    *   **Specificity:** It clearly describes the interaction with objects (\"standing on a black platform,\" \"step down onto a white ledge,\" \"using his hands for support,\" \"lands on the ground\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt. It is descriptive, accurate, and follows all formatting and content rules.",
