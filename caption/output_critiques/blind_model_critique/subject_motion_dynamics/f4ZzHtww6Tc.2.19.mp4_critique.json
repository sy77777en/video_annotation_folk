    "pre_caption": "From a low, fisheye perspective, a skateboarder jumps off a low marble ledge, with the board momentarily separating from his feet in mid-air. He lands back on the board on the sidewalk and then skates away from the camera, moving from the sidewalk into the street. The camera follows his movement, tracking him as he rides down the empty city street.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with light skin and tattoos on both arms is shown skateboarding. He wears a forward-facing black baseball cap, a short-sleeved, light-colored shirt, and dark, baggy cuffed jeans. On his feet are black and white high-top sneakers. He performs a trick, jumping with his dark skateboard onto a low ledge, and then lands back on the board on the pavement to ride away.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the chronological sequence of events and the camera's perspective, but it could be more specific about the skateboarder's actions. The description begins with the jump, but it omits the initial motion of the skateboarder approaching the ledge, such as pushing off to gain speed. The phrase \"jumps off\" is too generic for skateboarding; a more precise term like \"ollies off\" would better describe the action of jumping with the board. Similarly, \"the board momentarily separating from his feet\" is an awkward and slightly inaccurate description of an ollie, where the board is guided by the feet. The description of the ride-away is also general; it could be improved by specifying how the skateboarder moves into the street, for instance, by carving off the curb. Finally, stating the camera \"follows his movement, tracking him\" is redundant; simply saying the camera tracks him as he rides away would be more concise.",
