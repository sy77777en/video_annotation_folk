    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large, fluffy dog with a light cream coat lying on its back on a grassy surface, next to a person wearing a bright blue jacket, light blue pants, and a light green beanie. The person is lying on their back with hands behind their head, looking relaxed. The dog and person are positioned parallel to each other, creating a harmonious and peaceful scene. The background consists of green grass with scattered autumn leaves, adding a touch of seasonal color to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large, fluffy dog with a light cream coat lying on its back on a grassy surface. Next to the dog is a person wearing a bright blue jacket, light blue pants, and a light green beanie. The person is lying on their back with hands behind their head, looking relaxed. The dog and person are positioned parallel to each other, creating a harmonious and peaceful scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It fails to follow the core instructions in several critical ways.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Primary Goal Violation:** The main instruction is to describe the subject's **motion**. The provided caption describes a completely static scene, focusing on the appearance of the subjects (\"large, fluffy dog with a light cream coat,\" \"person wearing a bright blue jacket\") and their positioning (\"lying on its back,\" \"parallel to each other\"). If there is no movement in the video, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption does the opposite, providing extensive detail about a motionless scene.\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Language:** The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this rule by using words and phrases like \"looking relaxed,\" \"harmonious and peaceful scene,\" and \"adding a touch of seasonal color.\" These are interpretations of the mood, not objective descriptions of motion.\n\n*   **Focus on Appearance:** The caption dedicates significant space to describing what the subjects and background look like, which directly contradicts the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** Because the caption includes unnecessary details about appearance and setting, it is not concise. A correct caption, assuming no movement, would be a single, short sentence.\n\n**In summary,** the caption completely misunderstands the assignment. Instead of describing motion (or the lack thereof) concisely and objectively, it provides a detailed, subjective, and descriptive analysis of a static image.\n\nA correct caption, assuming there is no movement in the video, would be:\n\n**A dog and a person lie still on a grassy surface.**",
