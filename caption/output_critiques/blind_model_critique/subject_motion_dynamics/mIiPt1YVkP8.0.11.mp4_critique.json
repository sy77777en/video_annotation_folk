    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large, white commercial airplane viewed from behind, flying towards a runway. The aircraft's wings are extended horizontally, and its engines are visible under the wings. The plane is centered in the frame, with its tail fin prominently displayed. Below the aircraft, the runway is illuminated with lights that guide the plane's approach. To the left, there are structures resembling airport buildings, which are lit and appear small in comparison to the plane. The scene is set against a dark background, emphasizing the airplane and runway lights.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large, white commercial airplane viewed from behind, flying towards a runway.

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for the video. It fails to follow the core instructions in several critical ways.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Failure to Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to \"Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion.\" The provided caption almost exclusively describes a static scene. Phrases like \"viewed from behind,\" \"wings are extended horizontally,\" \"engines are visible,\" \"centered in the frame,\" \"tail fin prominently displayed,\" and \"scene is set against a dark background\" all describe static visual composition and appearance, not movement. The only mention of motion is the generic phrase \"flying towards a runway,\" which is not detailed.\n\n*   **Lack of Action Specificity:** The instruction asks to specify *how* subjects move (e.g., \"sprints across the finish line\" instead of \"is running\"). The caption's \"flying towards a runway\" is a generic description. It does not describe the specific motion, such as if the plane is descending, banking, or maintaining a steady approach.\n\n*   **Use of Abstract Descriptions:** The caption violates the rule to \"Avoid abstract descriptions\" by stating the scene is \"emphasizing the airplane and runway lights.\" This describes the visual effect rather than the concrete motion of the subject.\n\n*   **Inclusion of Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly says to avoid speculative statements. The phrase \"structures resembling airport buildings\" is a form of speculation, similar to the forbidden \"it appears.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption describes a static photograph rather than the dynamic action occurring in a video. It focuses on what the subject and scene look like instead of what the subject is *doing*, directly contradicting the fundamental goal of the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a large, white commercial airplane steadily descending towards the runway, its engines roaring as it approaches. The aircraft maintains a smooth, controlled glide, with its wings level and tail fin aligned with the runway. The runway lights guide its precise path, while the airport buildings on the left remain stationary, dwarfed by the plane's impressive size.",
