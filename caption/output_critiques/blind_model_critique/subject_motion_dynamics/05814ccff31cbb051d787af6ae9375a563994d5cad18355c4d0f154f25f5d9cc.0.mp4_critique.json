    "pre_caption": "A close-up view of a piece of wood with a rough, textured surface is shown. A long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings appears from the left side of the frame and begins to move across the wood. The insect continues to crawl steadily to the right, maintaining a consistent pace. The insect's movement is smooth and uninterrupted as it progresses further along the wood. The insect reaches the right side of the frame and starts to exit the view. The insect completely exits the frame, leaving the piece of wood in view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a close-up of a textured piece of wood as a long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings enters the frame and moves across the surface.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is accurate. It describes a plausible and clear sequence of events: an insect appearing on a piece of wood, crawling across it, and then exiting the frame. The description of the motion as steady and at a consistent pace is a precise and believable detail for this type of action.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It covers the entire arc of the subject's motion from the moment it enters the frame to the moment it leaves. It successfully captures the beginning, middle, and end of the action in a logical progression.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some instructions well but violates others.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at this. It presents the actions in a perfect sequence: the insect appears, moves across, and then exits.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** It correctly avoids emotional adjectives, speculative phrases (\"it appears\"), and ambiguity.\n*   **Describes Entry/Exit:** It clearly describes how the subject appears (\"from the left side of the frame\") and disappears (\"exits the frame\").\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is not concise. The sentence \"The insect's movement is smooth and uninterrupted as it progresses further along the wood\" is redundant. The preceding sentence, \"The insect continues to crawl steadily to the right, maintaining a consistent pace,\" already conveys this information. The caption could be shortened by combining or removing sentences.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption violates the instruction to focus on motion and avoid details not related to it.\n    *   The first sentence, \"A close-up view of a piece of wood with a rough, textured surface is shown,\" describes the static background, not the subject's motion.\n    *   The description \"A long-legged insect with a black body and orange markings\" provides unnecessary detail about the subject's appearance. Since there is only one subject, these details are not needed for differentiation and should be omitted per the instructions.\n*   **Repetition:** There is repetition in describing the movement. \"Move across the wood,\" \"crawl steadily to the right,\" and \"progresses further along the wood\" all describe the same core action.\n\nIn summary, while the caption is accurate and chronologically sound, it is too wordy and includes unnecessary descriptive details about the background and the subject's appearance, which goes against the core instructions to be concise and focused purely on motion.",
