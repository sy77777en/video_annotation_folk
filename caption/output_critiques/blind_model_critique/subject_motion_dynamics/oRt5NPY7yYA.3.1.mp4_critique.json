    "pre_caption": "An aerial view tracks a military convoy as it drives in formation along a straight desert highway. The entire convoy moves forward at a consistent speed. The central semi-truck is flanked by several green armored vehicles, which maintain their positions in front of and behind it. A dark SUV trails at the very rear of the procession. The camera moves parallel to the convoy, keeping the vehicles centered in the frame as they travel into the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A military-style convoy is shown traveling down a long, straight, four-lane highway in a desert environment. The main focus of the convoy is a large semi-truck with a dark cab and a long, white, windowless trailer that has large white patterns on its side. This central truck is escorted by several identical green, armored military vehicles, which are positioned both in front of and behind it. These escort vehicles are square in shape and appear to have turrets or equipment mounted on their roofs. Following at the very rear of the convoy is a dark-colored SUV.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the scene and the subject's collective movement, but it could be more specific about the visual dynamics. The description of the formation as \"flanked... in front of and behind\" is somewhat general; a more precise description of the vehicles' arrangement, such as a staggered column with two armored vehicles leading the semi-truck and two following, would better capture the tactical precision seen in the video. The caption also misses the subtle but important interaction with the environment; for instance, it fails to mention the small plumes of dust kicked up by the tires of each vehicle, a key visual detail that emphasizes their movement through the arid landscape. Additionally, the phrase \"travel into the distance\" conflicts with the description of a parallel tracking shot, where the convoy maintains its relative position in the frame. A more accurate description would state that the convoy moves steadily from one side of the frame to the other as the desert scenery scrolls past in the background.",
