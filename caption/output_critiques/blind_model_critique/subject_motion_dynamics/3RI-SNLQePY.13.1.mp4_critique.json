    "pre_caption": "In a dark, pixelated environment, two glowing cranes stand in shallow water, with one crane slightly ahead of the other. The cranes begin to move to the right, with the rightmost crane turning to face left. A blue-grey blob with eyes appears at the top right, moving left and jumping over obstacles. The blob successfully climbs a wall and jumps through a gap in the ceiling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases two stylized, pixelated cranes with glowing white and blue hues, standing in shallow water within an underground or cave-like setting. Their bodies are illuminated, creating a striking contrast against the dark surroundings. The cranes are positioned side by side, with one slightly ahead of the other, both initially facing to the right. As the video progresses, the rightmost crane turns to face left. Their long necks are gracefully curved, and they stand on thin legs. A blue-grey blob with eyes appears at the top right of the screen, moving left and jumping several times to overcome obstacles. Eventually, the blob jumps to climb a wall towards a gap in the ceiling. The scene has a digital, retro aesthetic, emphasizing the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the cranes.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved for better adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption appears to be accurate, describing a plausible sequence of events in what sounds like a video game. It clearly identifies two types of subjects (cranes and a blob) and their distinct actions.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a complete, chronological account of the motion in the video, from the initial movement of the cranes to the final action of the blob. It covers the appearance of a new subject and its interactions with the environment.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are correctly presented in the order they occur.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption primarily describes movement (\"move to the right,\" \"turning to face left,\" \"moving left and jumping,\" \"climbs a wall and jumps\").\n    *   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs to describe actions (e.g., \"climbs,\" \"jumps\") rather than generic ones.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **No Speculation:** It avoids ambiguous or speculative language.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Initial Static Description:** The first sentence (\"In a dark, pixelated environment, two glowing cranes stand in shallow water, with one crane slightly ahead of the other.\") focuses heavily on the static scene and appearance. The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" This initial description could be more concisely integrated into the action. For example: \"Two glowing cranes in shallow water begin to move to the right...\"\n    *   **Subjective Language:** The word \"successfully\" is slightly subjective as it implies a goal was achieved. A more objective description would be: \"The blob climbs a wall and jumps through a gap in the ceiling.\" This states the outcome without the value judgment.\n    *   **Appearance Description:** Describing the subject as a \"blue-grey blob with eyes\" focuses on its appearance. While it helps differentiate it from the cranes, it could be slightly more motion-focused as per the instructions, which state to avoid appearance details unless necessary for differentiation. In this case, it's a borderline but acceptable choice.",
