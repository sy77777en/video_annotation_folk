    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two men interacting with a red and black insulated delivery bag. The man on the left, wearing a red jacket with black accents, is holding the bag. The man on the right, dressed in a blue shirt and beige apron, is loading pots into the bag. Their actions suggest a collaborative effort, likely involving the preparation or transfer of items within the bag.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies two distinct subjects based on their clothing and describes their specific actions (holding a bag, placing items, closing the lid) and their interaction with each other and the object (the delivery bag).\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It describes the entire sequence of motion from beginning to end, ensuring no key actions are left out. It follows the chronological flow of events as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the sequence of events: holding the bag open, placing items inside, and then closing the bag.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on the actions of the subjects (\"holds... open,\" \"places items,\" \"closes the lid\") rather than their static appearance.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs to describe the interactions. Instead of a generic \"they pack a bag,\" it details that one man \"holds\" the bag open while the other \"places items into it.\"\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and gets straight to the point, creating a clear and coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is free of emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Subject Differentiation:** It correctly uses appearance details (\"man in the red jacket,\" \"man in the blue shirt and apron\") to distinguish between the two subjects and clarify their roles, which is necessary for describing their interaction accurately.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, clear, objective, and focused on the specific motions and interactions within the video.",
