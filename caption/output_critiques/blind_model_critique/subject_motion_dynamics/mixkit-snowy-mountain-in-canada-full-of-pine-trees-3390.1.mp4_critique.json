  "generated_critique": "This caption describes the scene as if it were a static photograph, completely omitting any description of motion, which is the central requirement of the task. In the video, the camera is not stationary; it performs a slow, sweeping pan from left to right, beginning with a focus on the lower slopes of the mountain and gradually tilting upward to reveal the main peak. More importantly, the caption fails to mention the most dynamic element in the frame: the \"sea of thick, white clouds\" is visibly in motion, drifting steadily from right to left and swirling around the base of the mountain. A proper description would chronologically detail the camera's pan and tilt while also describing the constant, flowing movement of the clouds, as these are the key actions occurring in the video. The use of the subjective adjective \"majestic\" also violates the instruction to avoid emotional language.",

The camera gradually tilts upward, revealing the main peak surrounded by snow-dusted evergreen trees. Throughout the scene, a sea of thick, white clouds drifts steadily from right to left, swirling around the mountain's base. In the distance, another range of snow-capped mountains is visible under a clear, light-blue sky.",
