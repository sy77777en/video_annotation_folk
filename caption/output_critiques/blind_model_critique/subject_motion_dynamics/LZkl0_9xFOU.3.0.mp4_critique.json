    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video focuses on a rectangular computer screen with a dark bezel, displaying a sequence of user interfaces. Initially, a menu with white text on a dark blue-grey background lists options such as \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet\" (highlighted in light green), \"Clear Xbox Live configuration,\" and \"Create a new profile.\" The screen then transitions to show \"Testing Network Connection\" and \"Logging on to Xbox Live: 0 seconds.\" Finally, it displays a list of arcade games, including \"Banjo-Kazooie\" and \"Burnout™ CRASH!,\" each accompanied by a small icon, the game title, the label \"Arcade Game,\" and a \"0/200\" score, all on a light green background with several square icons to the right. Partially visible on the right side of the screen is a blurry, light-toned object, which is actually a person's hair. Below and to the right of the screen, a stack of colorful magazines or books is present.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption accurately lists the sequence of on-screen text, but it fails to describe the actual motion occurring within the user interface, which is the primary focus of the video. For instance, you mention the \"Test Connection\" option is highlighted, but you don't describe the cursor or selection box moving down the menu to select it, nor the visual confirmation of the selection, such as a flash or an accompanying sound effect. The description of the loading process is also static; you could have mentioned the animated loading icon or a progress bar that fills while the \"Testing Network Connection\" text is displayed. Finally, stating the screen \"changes\" to the arcade game list is too vague. A more descriptive account would specify if the list slides in from the side, fades into view, or if the user actively scrolls through the list before it settles with \"Banjo-Kazooie\" at the top, as the motion of scrolling is a key visual element. The caption currently reads like a list of static screenshots rather than a description of a dynamic screen recording.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a computer screen showing a menu where the cursor moves down to highlight and select \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet,\" accompanied by a subtle flash and a clicking sound. The screen transitions smoothly to display \"Testing Network Connection,\" with an animated loading icon spinning and a progress bar gradually filling up. As the connection is established, the screen shifts to a list of arcade games, which slides in from the side. The user scrolls through the list, and it settles with \"Banjo-Kazooie\" prominently at the top.",
