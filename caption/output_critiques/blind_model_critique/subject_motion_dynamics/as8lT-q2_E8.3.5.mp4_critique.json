    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures a nighttime view of a highway in the foreground, where a person is riding a motorcycle towards the right side of the frame, while several cars move towards the left. In the background, there is a distant, illuminated city skyline, all seen from a moving perspective through a window.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is as follows:\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the key moving elements—the camera, the cars, and the motorcycle—it could be more precise and logically structured. The description of motion is somewhat disjointed, jumping from the camera's movement to the guardrail, then to the cars, back to the background, and finally to the motorcycle. A more coherent flow might describe the scene from background to foreground or group the subjects by their direction of travel. The description of the motorcycle's motion is too general; stating it \"travels in the same direction\" misses the crucial detail of its speed relative to the camera. For instance, the video might show the motorcycle slowly being overtaken by the camera's viewpoint, or it might be accelerating and pulling away toward the right edge of the frame. Additionally, the caption only mentions \"headlights,\" but the video likely shows a mix of white headlights from oncoming traffic and red taillights from the motorcycle and other potential vehicles moving in the same direction, a detail that would add clarity to the traffic flow. Finally, describing the guardrail as \"sliding across the view\" is passive; a more dynamic description like \"a silhouetted guardrail rushes past in the immediate foreground\" could better capture the sense of speed implied by the camera's movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera pans slowly to the right, creating a dynamic scene where a silhouetted guardrail rushes past in the immediate foreground. In the middle ground, a mix of white headlights from oncoming traffic and red taillights from vehicles moving in the same direction as the camera illuminate the highway. Among these vehicles, a motorcycle is visible, either being gradually overtaken by the camera's viewpoint or accelerating and pulling away toward the right edge of the frame. All of this unfolds against the backdrop of a stationary, illuminated city skyline, providing a striking contrast to the motion in the foreground and middle ground.",
