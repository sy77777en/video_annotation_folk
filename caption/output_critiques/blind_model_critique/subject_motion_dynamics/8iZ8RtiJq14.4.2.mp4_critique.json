    "pre_caption": "A humanoid figure sits hunched over a desk, its silver fingers moving as it types on a keyboard. A second, similar figure stands motionless behind it, looking down. A third humanoid figure walks into the frame from the left, stops next to the standing figure, and also looks down at the one typing. Two additional figures are partially visible on the far left, remaining stationary throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A humanoid figure with a silver, featureless head and silver forearms sits hunched in a black office chair, typing on a vintage beige keyboard at a desk. This figure wears a tan, short-sleeved collared shirt and dark pants with a brown belt. Standing directly behind it is a second humanoid figure, similarly styled with a silver head and arms, wearing a tan, short-sleeved shirt with chest pockets, a brown belt, and dark pants, looking down at the seated figure. A third humanoid figure, wearing a light grey, long-sleeved collared shirt and grey pants, enters from the left and stands beside the second figure, also looking down toward the desk. To the left of this third figure, there are two additional figures wearing tan collared shirts. All five figures have the same metallic, featureless heads.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events involving multiple subjects. It clearly distinguishes between moving and stationary figures and describes their specific actions (typing, walking, stopping, looking) and their spatial relationships to each other and to objects (desk, keyboard).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It accounts for all subjects in the scene, including the main active figure, the secondary figures that move or are static, and even the partially visible, stationary figures. It successfully captures the entire dynamic of the scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence: the initial state of the first two figures is described, followed by the entrance and action of the third figure.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on motion, using strong, specific verbs like \"sits hunched,\" \"fingers moving,\" \"types,\" \"walks,\" \"stops,\" and \"stands motionless.\"\n*   **Specificity:** It avoids generic descriptions. Instead of \"a robot is working,\" it says \"a humanoid figure sits hunched over a desk, its silver fingers moving as it types on a keyboard,\" which is a perfect example of describing a specific action and interaction with an object.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is entirely objective and free of emotional, subjective, or speculative words. It sticks to observable facts.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is concise yet informative, using simple, natural English that is easy to understand.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It correctly identifies the primary action (typing) and describes the other subjects' movements (or lack thereof) in relation to the main subject, fulfilling the instruction perfectly.\n*   **Subject Reveal:** It explicitly notes how a new subject enters the scene (\"walks into the frame from the left\"), which is an important detail.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, objective, and descriptive, focusing entirely on the observable motion within the video.",
