    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a white ceramic toilet with a rounded seat and a rectangular tank, viewed from above. The toilet lid is initially upright, revealing the seat and bowl, and then the lid is lowered to cover the bowl. The toilet has a smooth, glossy surface and a standard design, with the seat and lid both matching in color and material. The orientation of the toilet remains consistent throughout the video, and no other objects or subjects are present.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The toilet seat starts in an upright position, exposing the bowl and inner rim, and then the lid is lowered until it covers the bowl completely. No other movement occurs in the video.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved for accuracy and clarity.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **High:** The caption correctly identifies the subject and the general motion.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The primary issue is the potential confusion between the \"toilet seat\" and the \"lid.\" The caption states the \"seat\" is upright, but then says the \"lid\" is lowered. A toilet has two separate hinged parts: the seat (which you sit on) and the lid (which covers the seat).\n    *   If both the seat and lid start upright and are lowered together, the caption is inaccurate because it only mentions the lid being lowered.\n    *   If the seat is already down and only the lid is lowered, the first part of the sentence (\"The toilet seat starts in an upright position\") is incorrect.\n    *   A more accurate description would clarify which part moves. For example: \"The toilet seat and lid start in an upright position and are then lowered together...\" or \"With the seat already down, the toilet lid is lowered...\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption effectively describes the entire sequence of events from start to finish. It establishes the initial state, describes the single, clear motion, and confirms the end state by noting that no other movement occurs.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** **Excellent.** The action is described sequentially: starting position, then the lowering motion.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** **Excellent.** The description centers on the action of the lid being lowered.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** **Good.** The language is simple and direct. However, the ambiguity between \"seat\" and \"lid\" slightly reduces its clarity.\n*   **Objectivity:** **Excellent.** The caption avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Specificity:** **Good.** It correctly identifies the action as \"lowered\" and the result as \"covers the bowl completely.\" The lack of specificity regarding the parts (seat vs. lid) is the only minor weakness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption successfully follows most of the key instructions, particularly regarding structure, tone, and focus on motion. Its main flaw is a lack of precision in describing the subject's components, which makes the description of the motion potentially inaccurate depending on the exact events in the video. Correcting the ambiguity between the \"seat\" and \"lid\" would make it an excellent caption.",
