    "pre_caption": "The video shows a stylized, animated depiction of a human heart that is beating. The heart starts at a slow pace and gradually increases in speed as the video continues. The heart is bright pink with smooth, rounded surfaces and prominent, darker pink lines representing veins or arteries. Several tubular structures extend from the top, resembling blood vessels, and are also bright pink. The background is dark, which makes the heart and its surrounding structures stand out vividly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a stylized, animated depiction of a human heart that is depicted as beating. The heart starts at a slow pace and gradually increases in speed as the video continues. It is bright pink with smooth, rounded surfaces and prominent, darker pink lines representing veins or arteries. Several tubular structures extend from the top, resembling blood vessels, and are also bright pink. The heart is centrally positioned, and its design is abstract, focusing on bold colors and simplified forms rather than realistic details.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a stylized, animated human heart and accurately describes its motion: it beats, starting slowly and then accelerating. The visual details mentioned (colors, textures, background) are also factually correct for a typical video of this nature.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption completely describes the essential motion in the video. It covers the primary action (beating) and the change in that action over time (gradually increasing in speed).\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption does not adhere well to the instructions.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption fails this rule significantly. More than half of the text is dedicated to describing the heart's appearance (\"bright pink with smooth, rounded surfaces,\" \"darker pink lines,\" \"tubular structures,\" \"dark background\"), which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** As a result of including extensive visual details, the caption is not concise. The core motion is described in the first two sentences, while the last three sentences are unnecessary descriptions of appearance.\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is an unnecessary introductory phrase. The instructions imply starting directly with the description of the action.\n\nIn summary, while the caption is factually correct, it fails to follow the core negative constraints of the instructions by focusing heavily on visual appearance instead of exclusively describing the subject's motion in a concise manner.\n\nA better caption following the instructions would be:\n\nAn animated heart beats at a slow, steady rhythm. The pace of its contractions gradually increases, becoming progressively faster throughout the video.",
