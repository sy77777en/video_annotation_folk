    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man with light skin and short, dark hair. He has a slight beard and mustache, and his expression appears contemplative. He is wearing a collared shirt with a checkered pattern. The man is facing forward, with his gaze initially directed downward and his eyes appearing heavy-lidded. He then slightly raises his head and opens his eyes, suggesting a shift in focus or thought. His facial features are prominent, and the lighting highlights the texture of his skin.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair.

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video: A static, close-up shot of a man against a dark, out-of-focus background. The lighting is dramatic, coming from one side. The man is initially looking down, his face partially in shadow. He then very slowly and deliberately lifts his chin, bringing his face fully into the light, and his eyes, which were half-closed, open wider to look directly into the camera.\n\nYour caption correctly identifies the chronological order of the man's movements, but it includes several elements that conflict with the instructions. The description contains subjective and speculative phrases such as \"his expression appears contemplative\" and \"suggesting a shift in focus or thought,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions of motion. Furthermore, a significant portion of the caption is dedicated to the man's static appearance (\"light skin,\" \"checkered pattern,\" \"facial features are prominent\"), which detracts from the primary goal of describing his actions. The description of the motion itself could be more specific; for example, instead of just \"slightly raises his head and opens his eyes,\" it would be more informative to describe the slow, deliberate pace of the head lift and clarify that his eyes transition from a downward, half-lidded state to looking directly forward. A more effective caption would omit the appearance details and interpretations, focusing exclusively on a precise, factual account of the physical movement: the man slowly lifts his head from a downward-facing position and simultaneously widens his eyes to fix his gaze forward.",
