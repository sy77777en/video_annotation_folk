  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the primary subjects and their interaction, but it lacks the specific, chronological description of the motion as requested. The description is repetitive, stating that waves crash against the rock multiple times without detailing the distinct phases of a single wave's movement. For example, a more effective caption would first describe a large wave swelling as it approaches, then breaking into a burst of white spray upon impact with the rock's base. It could then detail how the water surges up the dark, vertical face of the rock formation before cascading back down into the churning sea, with the white foam slowly receding in the brief lull before the next wave builds and repeats the cycle. The current caption also includes the subjective phrase \"dynamic and powerful scene,\" which should be omitted in favor of a purely objective description of the water's motion.",
