    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a white sedan with a sleek, modern design, featuring distinctive red tail lights and a horizontal light bar. The car is seen in a wide shot, positioned on a wet road at night. Its dim red tail lights glow and reflect off the slick surface, while the headlights cast a short beam of light ahead. The car moves gradually into the distance, with the headlights not visible when the car is facing the camera from the side. The scene captures the car as the sole prominent subject, emphasizing its motion and the atmospheric setting.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved for conciseness and a stricter focus on motion.\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is accurate. It correctly describes a white sedan driving on a wet road at night, with its tail lights on, moving away from the camera's point of view.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption completely covers the subject's primary motion. There are no other significant actions to describe.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:**\n        *   **Chronological Order:** The description of the continuous motion is logical and sequential.\n        *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** It uses simple, natural English and is easy to understand.\n        *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n        *   **Focus on Motion:** The core of the caption (\"drives forward,\" \"moving away,\" \"continues down the road\") correctly describes the car's movement.\n\n    *   **Areas for Improvement:**\n        *   **Conciseness:** The caption is slightly redundant. The final clause, \"and the car becomes smaller in the distance as it travels further away,\" describes the effect of perspective. This is already implied by the phrase \"gradually moving away from the camera.\" The instruction asks for a \"concise\" description, and removing this redundancy would make it stronger.\n        *   **Focus on Motion vs. State:** The phrase \"Its red tail lights remain illuminated\" describes a static state of the car, not its motion. While it is a key visual detail, a stricter adherence to the instructions would prioritize describing the movement itself.",
