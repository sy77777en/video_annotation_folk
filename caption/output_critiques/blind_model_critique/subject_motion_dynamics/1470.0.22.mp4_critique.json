    "pre_caption": "The video shows a child in a colorful outfit and red hat sitting on a bed in a room with abstract wall art and airplane decorations. The child begins to move, gradually shifting their position and starting to turn their body. The child continues to turn, using their arms for support, and their legs start to lift off the bed. The child completes the turn, now facing away from the camera, and continues to adjust their position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a child wearing a colorful, patterned outfit and a bright red hat. The child has light skin and medium-length hair, and they are actively moving on a bed. Despite the dynamic motion, the child's expression suggests they might be crying, making them the main focus with their actions and attire drawing attention.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is moderately effective but fails to follow several key instructions. While it successfully describes the motion chronologically, it includes unnecessary details and violates the core instruction to focus strictly on motion.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of movements. The actions—shifting, turning, using arms for support, lifting legs, and completing the turn—are presented in a logical and chronological order.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description covers the entire motion from the initial static position to the final one. It provides a good level of detail by mentioning how the child uses their arms and how their legs move, making the description of the turn quite complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Good:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are correctly presented in the sequence they occur.\n    *   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The caption avoids emotional language, speculation (\"appears to,\" \"might be\"), and abstract descriptions.\n    *   **Simple English:** The language used is clear and easy to understand.\n\n*   **Needs Improvement:**\n    *   **Violation - Focus on Motion:** The very first sentence, \"The video shows a child in a colorful outfit and red hat sitting on a bed in a room with abstract wall art and airplane decorations,\" is a direct violation of the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" This sentence describes the static scene, the subject's appearance, and the room's decor, all of which are explicitly discouraged.\n    *   **Violation - Conciseness:** Because of the unnecessary first sentence, the caption is not as concise as it should be. Removing this sentence would significantly improve its conciseness.\n    *   **Minor Violation - Redundancy:** The phrase \"The video shows...\" is redundant and should be omitted. The description should begin directly with the subject's action.\n    *   **Minor Violation - Generic Descriptions:** Phrases like \"begins to move\" and \"continues to adjust their position\" are somewhat generic. While not a major error, the description could be stronger by being more specific from the start (e.g., \"A child sitting on a bed begins to turn their body...\").\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption's primary failure is its inclusion of a long, descriptive opening sentence about the static scene and the child's appearance, which directly contradicts the instructions. While the subsequent description of the motion is good, the caption as a whole does not adhere to the core requirements of being a concise, motion-focused paragraph.",
