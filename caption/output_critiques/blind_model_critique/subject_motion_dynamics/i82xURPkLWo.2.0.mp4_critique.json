    "pre_caption": "A man in a denim jacket stands in front of a colorful, abstract painting, looking down initially. Another man, wearing a leather jacket, stands up and faces the first man. The first man continues to look at the second man, who then raises his hand slightly. The first man maintains his gaze on the second man, who appears to be gesturing or emphasizing a point during their interaction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man as the main subject, who is wearing a dark denim jacket over a black shirt. He has a buzz cut and a trimmed beard. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation, as his facial expression changes slightly throughout the video. A secondary subject, another man, becomes visible when he stands up. He has curly hair and is wearing a dark leather jacket. The two men are facing each other, suggesting an interaction or dialogue between them. The setting includes a large, abstract painting in the background, adding a colorful backdrop to the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is generally accurate in describing the subjects and the chronological sequence of their actions. It correctly identifies two men and their basic movements (standing up, looking, raising a hand).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption provides a complete, high-level overview of the interaction from beginning to end. It describes the actions of both subjects.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The caption violates this rule directly with the phrase \"**appears to be** gesturing.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid abstract descriptions\":** The instruction warns against abstract descriptions like \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\" The caption's phrase \"**emphasizing a point**\" is a similar violation. It describes the *inferred intent* of the action rather than the physical motion itself. A better description would focus on the concrete movement, such as \"moves his hand up and down.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid ambiguous options\":** The instruction forbids \"ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The phrase \"**gesturing or emphasizing a point**\" presents exactly this kind of ambiguous choice.\n\nIn summary, while the caption is chronologically accurate, it fails to adhere to the core negative constraints of the instructions by including speculation, abstract interpretation, and ambiguity.",
