    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective inside a wooden fire lookout tower, a vast, mountainous landscape is visible at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden-yellow light, with layers of silhouetted mountains and dark coniferous trees seen from a wooden balcony with a railing. On an interior wall, an orange sign with the word \"PARADISE\" in black letters hangs to the left of a small, square picture of a raccoon. To the right is a red and white \"VOLUNTEER\" poster featuring a shield emblem with a tower silhouette. In the foreground, a portion of an orange supply box with a small, angled lid is held by dark straps.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible and common type of video shot. It details a continuous camera movement from an interior to an exterior location.\n*   **Completeness:** It covers the entire motion chronologically, starting from the initial pan inside, moving through the doorway, continuing the pan on the balcony, and ending with the reveal of the landscape. It leaves no part of the described action out.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption is entirely dedicated to describing the motion of the \"first-person perspective\" (the camera), using specific verbs like \"pans\" and \"moving.\"\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, sequential order: \"pans... moving from... through... and onto... continues to pan... revealing.\"\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It provides all the essential information about the movement and setting without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"stunning\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems to be\"). It uses neutral, descriptive words like \"interior,\" \"exterior,\" and \"wooden.\"\n    *   **Specificity:** It clearly specifies the type of movement (\"pans to the right\") and the path of the subject (\"from an interior view... through a doorway, and onto an exterior wooden balcony\").\n    *   **No Abstraction:** It avoids abstract descriptions like \"creating a sense of discovery\" and sticks to concrete, observable actions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a perfect example of what was requested. It is a clear, objective, and chronologically accurate description of the subject's motion.",
