    "pre_caption": "The video shows a white egret standing near the edge of a water body, with its legs partially submerged in the water. The egret begins to move slowly towards the left side of the frame, maintaining a steady pace. The background consists of a grassy bank with some vegetation, and the water reflects the surrounding environment. The egret's movement is consistent and deliberate, suggesting it is either searching for food or patrolling its territory.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a white egret with a long neck and slender body, standing near the edge of a water body. Its plumage is smooth and bright, and it has a distinct yellow beak. The egret is positioned close to the water, with its legs partially submerged, suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move. The setting includes grassy vegetation along the bank, providing a natural habitat for the bird. The egret's posture is attentive, with its head slightly tilted, indicating alertness or focus on its surroundings.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The description of the egret's actions (standing, then moving slowly to the left) is plausible and likely accurate to the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption describes a simple sequence of motion. However, it is incomplete in its focus, as it dedicates significant space to describing the static background and the subject's appearance rather than providing more detail on the motion itself (e.g., how it lifts its legs, its head posture while walking).\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption violates the instructions in the following ways:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The caption spends too much time on non-motion details.\n    *   **Problem:** \"a white egret standing near the edge of a water body, with its legs partially submerged in the water.\" and \"The background consists of a grassy bank with some vegetation, and the water reflects the surrounding environment.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" and \"If the video features salient human or non-human subjects, focus your description on their motion.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculative Statements\":** The caption speculates on the egret's intent and provides ambiguous options.\n    *   **Problem:** \"...suggesting it is either searching for food or patrolling its territory.\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives\":** The caption uses a subjective word that implies intent.\n    *   **Problem:** \"...deliberate...\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Concise\" and \"No Introductory Text\":** The caption is not as concise as it could be and includes an unnecessary introductory phrase.\n    *   **Problem:** \"The video shows...\"\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" and \"Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph...\"",
