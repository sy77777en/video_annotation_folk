    "pre_caption": "In a video game, a blue chef in the bottom right kitchen picks up a plated dish and moves toward the center. Simultaneously, a red chef in the top right kitchen moves left. The blue chef jumps onto a moving lily pad, which carries them to the top right kitchen, where they jump off and place the dish on the counter. Concurrently, the red chef jumps onto another moving lily pad, which transports them to the top left kitchen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a video game, two cartoonish chef characters are visible. Both are wearing classic white chef hats. One character is dressed in red, while the other in blue.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It successfully adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the specific movements of two distinct subjects (\"blue chef,\" \"red chef\") and their interactions with objects (\"plated dish,\" \"moving lily pad,\" \"counter\"). It correctly identifies their starting and ending locations within the scene.\n\n*   **Completeness:** It provides a comprehensive, end-to-end description of the primary action (the blue chef delivering a dish) while also including the significant parallel motion of the secondary subject (the red chef). It doesn't leave out any critical steps in the described sequence.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological and Concise:** The actions are presented in a clear, logical sequence. It uses terms like \"Simultaneously\" and \"Concurrently\" to effectively manage the parallel timelines of the two chefs without creating confusion.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption excels at describing motion with specific verbs (\"picks up,\" \"moves toward,\" \"jumps onto,\" \"carries,\" \"jump off,\" \"place\") rather than using generic or abstract terms.\n    *   **Objective and Factual:** It avoids subjective language, emotional adjectives, and speculation. The description is based entirely on observable actions.\n    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, creating a clear picture of the events in the video.\n    *   **Subject Differentiation:** It correctly uses appearance details (\"blue chef,\" \"red chef\") for the necessary purpose of distinguishing between the two subjects.\n    *   **Format:** The output is a single, well-structured paragraph as requested.",
