    "pre_caption": "An animated boy holds his face with both hands, using his right hand to pull down the skin under his right eye, causing his eyes to roll upwards and apart.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features an animated young boy with fair skin and short brown hair. His facial expressions transition from eye-rolling to a look of confusion, marked by continuous eye movement. Another person's hands are involved, initially using one hand to open his right eye, followed by both hands slapping his cheeks. His actions suggest he is either responding to something unseen or making exaggerated, goofy faces.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main sequence of events but could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions against speculation and generic descriptions. The phrase \"appears to belong to another person\" is speculative; the description should only state that a hand enters the frame and opens the eye, without assuming ownership unless it's visually confirmed. The description of the boy's actions—\"makes a series of eye movements and exaggerated, playful facial expressions\"—is too general. A better caption would specify these motions chronologically, for example, \"his eye darts left and right, then he puffs his cheeks and sticks out his tongue.\" Lastly, the phrase \"adding to the playful nature of the scene\" is an emotional interpretation, which should be avoided. The final action should be described purely in terms of motion, such as \"two hands enter from the sides and slap his cheeks, causing them to jiggle,\" while also clarifying if these are the same hands from the beginning or the boy's own.",
