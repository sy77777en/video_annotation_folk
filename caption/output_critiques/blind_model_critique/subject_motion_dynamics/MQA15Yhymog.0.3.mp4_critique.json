In the background, a man also surfs in the same direction on a separate board. As the woman glides forward, another surfboard passes by on the right, creating a splash.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a woman with light skin and long blonde hair, viewed from behind. She is wearing a dark-colored bikini top and bright yellow bikini bottoms. She is standing on a yellow surfboard, with her arms held out to her sides for balance. In the middle ground, a man with light skin, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and black shorts, is also standing on a surfboard. The blue and white surfboard in the middle ground belongs to him, while a white surfboard is visible in the water to the left of the woman.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption misses the subject's initial action; if the video shows the woman transitioning from paddling to standing on the board, this \"pop-up\" motion should be described first to maintain chronological order. The description of the secondary surfer who \"falls backward\" is somewhat generic and could be more specific, for instance, if he loses his balance and tumbles sideways off the board. The most significant ambiguity is \"another surfboard passes by\"; it is crucial to specify if this board is riderless or if another person is surfing on it, as this detail fundamentally changes the scene. Furthermore, the interaction is vague; clarifying if this other board cuts closely in front of the woman or simply moves past in the distance would better describe the spatial relationship and potential impact on her own motion.",

In the background, a man also surfs in the same direction on a separate board, but he loses his balance and tumbles sideways off the board. As the woman glides forward, another surfboard with a rider passes closely by on the right, creating a splash and momentarily disrupting her path.",
