    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective through the green-tinted view of night vision, a modern assault rifle with a holographic sight is held in the foreground. In the area ahead, several human figures in combat-style clothing are lying motionless on the dirt ground in various positions. A subtitle at the bottom of the screen displays the text, \"Price: You're clear.\"**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events but lacks specificity regarding the nature of the motion and the subjects involved. The phrase \"descends and lands\" is vague; in the video, the first-person view drops rapidly from a height before landing with a hard jolt on a concrete surface, an action that implies a significant fall rather than a controlled descent. The term \"motionless figures\" is also ambiguous; the video clearly shows these are soldiers in tactical gear, and describing them as such would provide crucial context for the scene. Furthermore, \"moving forward\" does not capture the quality of the movement; the character advances cautiously with a weapon raised, suggesting a stealthy or hostile environment. Finally, the description could better connect the elements in the scene by specifying that the \"covered structure\" is a military-style tent and the additional \"motionless figures\" are slumped directly against its entrance, clarifying their spatial relationship.",

Initially, the camera looks down at several motionless soldiers in tactical gear on the ground.
