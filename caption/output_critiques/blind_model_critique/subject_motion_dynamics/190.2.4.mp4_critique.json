    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man wearing a brown hat with a darker brown or black band encircling it, sunglasses, and a brown jacket. He has a goatee and is holding a silver object close to his face. The man is positioned prominently in the foreground, facing slightly to the side. In the latter part of the video, he is seen from behind, walking away down a tree-lined street. The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and greenery visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** A man wearing a brown hat and brown jacket is closely examining a silver object in his hand while standing on a street with trees and buildings in the background. He then raises his hand to adjust his sunglasses. After adjusting his sunglasses, he turns around and starts walking away from the camera, still holding the object.\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully captures the sequence of events but fails to adhere to some key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of actions: examining an object, adjusting sunglasses, and walking away. The description of the motion itself is precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete, describing the subject's actions from the beginning to the end of the sequence in a clear, step-by-step manner.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the instruction to present actions in chronological order, using transition words like \"then\" and \"After\" to guide the reader.\n*   **Specificity of Motion:** It uses specific verbs to describe actions (\"examining,\" \"raises his hand to adjust,\" \"turns around,\" \"starts walking away\") rather than generic terms.\n*   **Object Interaction:** It clearly describes the man's interaction with the \"silver object\" and his \"sunglasses.\"\n*   **Clarity and Objectivity:** The language is simple, natural, and avoids subjective, emotional, or speculative words.\n\n**Where the caption can be improved:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The primary weakness is its inclusion of non-motion-related details. The instruction explicitly states, \"**Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions**\" and to avoid describing appearance unless needed to differentiate subjects.\n    *   The caption starts by describing the man's clothing (\"wearing a brown hat and brown jacket\") and the setting (\"on a street with trees and buildings in the background\"). Since he is the only subject, these details are unnecessary and violate the core instruction.\n*   **Conciseness:** By removing the unnecessary descriptive details about appearance and background, the caption would become more concise and focused, better aligning with the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it accurately and chronologically describes the subject's movements with specific, objective language. However, it is not a perfect fit for the instructions because it includes details about the subject's appearance and the background, which the instructions explicitly ask to omit.\n\nA revised caption that fully adheres to all instructions would look like this:\n\n**\"A man stands examining a silver object in his hand, then raises his hand to adjust his sunglasses. He subsequently turns around and walks away from the camera while still holding the object.\"**",
