    "pre_caption": "The video shows a person with pink hair, wearing glasses and a black mask, walking along a sidewalk. The background includes a building with multiple windows, trees with green and purple foliage, and street lamps. The person continues to walk forward, and their head slightly turns to the right. The person raises their right hand as they walk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person with pink hair, wearing glasses and a black mask, positioned on the far left. Only part of their upper body is visible, occupying about 10% of the frame's width. The person is facing forward, with their head slightly turned to the right. The scene is set against a street backdrop with a decorative metal railing and trees, including one with purple blossoms.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption violates the core instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" It dedicates significant space to describing the subject's static appearance (\"pink hair, wearing glasses and a black mask\") and the static background (\"a building with multiple windows, trees...\"). These details should be omitted as they do not describe movement.\n\n*   **Conciseness and Redundancy:** By including unnecessary appearance and background details, the caption is not concise. The instructions state not to repeat details from human-written descriptions and to only use appearance to differentiate between multiple subjects, which is not the case here.\n\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is forbidden by the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown or introductory text.\"\n\n*   **Specificity of Motion:** While the actions are in chronological order, the description of \"walking\" is generic. The instructions encourage more specific descriptions of how the subject moves.\n\nIn summary, the caption is inaccurate in its adherence to the rules. It functions more like a general description of the scene rather than a focused, motion-centric caption as requested by the instructions.\n\nA better caption following the instructions would be:\n\n**A person walks forward along a sidewalk, turns their head slightly to the right, and then raises their right hand.**",
