    "pre_caption": "Two adult lionesses walk forward side-by-side on a dirt path. A small cub follows behind the lioness on the right, while another cub walks behind the lioness on the left, briefly climbing onto her back. As they proceed, two more cubs run in from the right to join the group. The two lionesses and the initial cubs then stop and stand still, facing forward, while the other two cubs continue to move around them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two adult lionesses with tawny, light brown fur and muscular builds walk forward, initially accompanied by two small lion cubs. As they move, two additional cubs join them. The lionesses maintain similar positions, walking side by side with alert expressions and their mouths slightly open. The cubs, sharing the same tawny fur color as the adults, follow closely. At the beginning, one cub climbs onto the back of the lioness on the left while walking behind her, and another walks behind.\n\n\n**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events, but it could be more specific about the nature of the movements. For instance, the description of the cub \"briefly climbing onto her back\" is a good start, but it omits how the action concludes; a more complete description would mention if the cub then slides off, jumps down, or is shaken off. Similarly, the final phrase, \"continue to move around them,\" is too general. The video likely shows more specific, playful actions, such as the two cubs weaving between the adults' legs, tumbling over one another, or playfully swatting at the lionesses' tails. Describing these specific interactions would create a more vivid contrast between the energetic cubs and the stationary adults. Lastly, while \"walk forward\" is correct, a more descriptive verb like \"stroll\" or \"pad\" could better capture the lionesses' deliberate, steady gait on the path.",
