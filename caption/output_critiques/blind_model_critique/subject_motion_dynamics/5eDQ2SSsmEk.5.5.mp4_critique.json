The left billboard features a woman in a bikini, with the text 'OFF WORLD ISLANDS' above her, and she appears to be moving slightly.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A large, illuminated rectangular billboard on the left prominently displays a medium-full body image of a woman with blonde hair and fair skin, wearing a white two-piece bikini. She poses with her hands clasped behind her head, looking slightly to her left, standing on a sandy beach with a palm tree to her right, under the large yellow text \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS.\" In the center of the scene, a dark silhouette of a man, seemingly wearing a jacket, stands facing away from the viewer. To the right, another large, illuminated billboard shows a cartoonish pink pig wearing a white chef's hat, with the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24\" visible on a red and white background.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the animated billboards but completely fails to describe the motion of the man, who is the primary subject. It only states his static position. In the video, the man is not motionless; he stands with his back to the camera, his long coat fluttering in the wind from the rooftop. He slowly turns his head from the left billboard to the right one, tracking the animations. The description of the woman's movement is slightly interpretive; instead of \"gently placed\" and \"caressing,\" it should state that her hands move slowly behind her head. For the pig, the phrase \"appears to be slightly waving\" is speculative; the caption should definitively state that the pig waves the green object. Furthermore, the description of the pig's reappearance could be more dynamic, such as \"the pig animation slides up from the bottom of the screen.\" The caption also misses the constant motion of flying vehicles passing between the buildings in the background, which adds a layer of activity to the scene. The primary focus should be on the man's observable actions, followed by a concise description of the billboard animations.",
