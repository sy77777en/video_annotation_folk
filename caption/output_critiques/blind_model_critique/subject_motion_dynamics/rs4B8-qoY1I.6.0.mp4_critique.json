    "pre_caption": "In a pixelated, isometric video game scene, a mouse cursor moves from the top left, hovers over a button labeled \"EVACUATE,\" which then changes to \"GOING,\" and finally moves to the right. A squad of four figures in green coats and another figure in a black suit remain stationary in the center of the screen throughout the clip.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a pixelated, isometric view, a squad of four figures stands in a group. Each figure is clad in a long, olive-green trench coat and holds a rifle. Red numbers, 1 through 4, are displayed above their respective heads, with the number \"1\" alternating between red and yellow. Close-up portraits show these figures wearing light blue goggles, with the tops of their heads appearing red. Two figures in simple black suits stand nearby, initially facing the squad. As the squad turns left and begins walking, both men in black suits follow them.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption omits the crucial interaction that likely triggers the main event; it states the \"EVACUATE\" button changes but fails to mention that the mouse cursor first moves to and clicks on it, which is a key cause-and-effect action. The description of the characters' movement, \"turns to the left and moves in that direction,\" is too generic and lacks detail. It would be more informative to specify their gait and formation, such as whether they begin running as a tight unit or walking single-file. Furthermore, the relationship between the \"squad of four\" and the \"two individuals\" is unclear; the caption could have first established their initial stationary positions, for example, noting that the two individuals, perhaps dressed as civilians, are standing behind the uniformed squad before any movement occurs. Finally, the chronology feels slightly disjointed, as it's not specified whether the camera shift happens before or after the evacuation is initiated, which makes the sequence of the player's actions ambiguous.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a pixelated, isometric video game scene, a mouse cursor moves from the top left and clicks on a button labeled \"EVACUATE,\" causing it to change to \"GOING.\" Following this interaction, the camera shifts slightly, and a squad of four figures in green coats, initially standing in a tight formation, begins to run to the left. Behind them, two individuals in civilian attire, including one in a black suit, also start moving in the same direction, maintaining a single-file line. The sequence clearly shows the cause-and-effect relationship between the player's action and the characters' movement.",
