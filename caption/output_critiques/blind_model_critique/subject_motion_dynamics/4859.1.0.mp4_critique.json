    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with shoulder-length brown hair and a beard, wearing a green t-shirt, a yellow reflective vest, tan pants, and a black cap, pushes a large green wheeled trash can. The trash can has a black graffiti-style drawing of a face on its side. A second individual, dressed in a full-body light gray bird costume with an orange beak and large wings, and wearing bright red footwear, rides a skateboard, entering the frame from the right side halfway through the video and appearing to jump or perform a trick near the trash can.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a complex scene with two subjects performing distinct actions. It clearly identifies the subjects (a man, an individual in a bird costume), the objects they interact with (trash can, skateboard), and their specific movements.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, capturing all essential motion details without being verbose. It details the man's action of \"pushing a... trash can that is tilted and rolling\" and the skateboarder's full sequence of \"rides... into the frame,\" \"approaching,\" and \"performs a jump trick... becoming airborne.\" It successfully paints a full picture of the action in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given rules perfectly:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly uses \"Simultaneously\" to describe actions happening at the same time and \"then\" to indicate the subsequent action (the jump trick), perfectly adhering to the chronological requirement.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption is built around strong, specific action verbs: \"walks forward,\" \"pushing,\" \"rolling,\" \"rides,\" \"approaching,\" \"performs a jump trick,\" and \"becoming airborne.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of detail into a single, well-structured sentence without any filler words.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective (\"amazing,\" \"funny\"), or speculative (\"appears to be\") language.\n*   **Specificity:** It excels in specificity. Instead of \"a man moves a can,\" it's \"a man walks forward, pushing a large green wheeled trash can that is tilted and rolling.\" Instead of \"a person does a trick,\" it's \"performs a jump trick on the skateboard, becoming airborne with the board.\"\n*   **Subject Interaction:** It clearly describes the man's interaction with the trash can and the skateboarder's movement relative to the man (\"approaching the man and the trash can\").\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand despite the complexity of the scene.\n*   **No Unnecessary Details:** It uses appearance details (\"green wheeled,\" \"bird costume\") only as necessary to identify and differentiate the subjects and key objects.\n*   **Frame Transition:** It correctly notes that the skateboarder \"rides a skateboard into the frame from the right,\" describing how a subject is revealed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is precise, objective, and descriptive, perfectly capturing the subjects' motion in a clear and chronological manner.",
