    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A white man with a dark beard and mustache is shown in a close-up, speaking to a woman. He wears a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest with a patch that reads \"G-25\". The woman, seen from over her shoulder, has blonde hair tied up in a bun and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The man is facing her, with a serious expression on his face.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent and adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. It identifies the primary subject (a man with a beard), his action (speaking), the secondary subject (a woman), and their interaction. The description of motion—\"moves his mouth,\" \"head and facial features shift\"—is a precise and factual account of the physical movements involved in speaking.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is complete for a scene focused on a conversation. It captures the essential motion of the main subject without adding superfluous details. It also provides necessary context about the secondary subject (her back is to the camera), which helps the reader visualize the scene correctly. It doesn't omit any critical motion that would be expected in such a scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows every rule outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is brief yet clearly communicates the core activity in the video.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions described (mouth moving, head shifting) are simultaneous with the act of speaking. The caption correctly presents them as concurrent actions (\"as he speaks,\" \"as he talks\") rather than a sequence, which is appropriate.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption's primary focus is on the man's movements (\"moves his mouth,\" \"head and facial features shift\"). The mention of his beard and the woman's position serves only to identify and contextualize the subjects, as permitted by the instructions.\n*   **Avoids Speculation and Subjectivity:** The language is entirely objective. It avoids emotional words (e.g., \"passionately,\" \"calmly\") and speculative phrases (\"appears to be,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Simple and Natural English:** The sentences are clear, direct, and easy to understand.\n*   **Specific Actions:** Instead of just saying \"a man is talking,\" the caption specifies the physical motions involved (\"moves his mouth,\" \"head and facial features shift\"), which is a more detailed and effective description.\n*   **Subject Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction (\"speaks directly to a woman\"), fulfilling the requirement to detail relationships and relative movements between subjects.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is factual, clear, and focused entirely on describing the subject's motion in an objective manner.",
