    "pre_caption": "A man is walking through a field of tall, dry grass, with his gaze directed forward. He is wearing a light brown jacket over a blue shirt and has a backpack on his back. The background consists of leafless trees under a clear sky. The man moves his arms slightly as he walks, pushing aside the grass with his hands.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with a medium build and a beard, wearing a light brown jacket over a blue shirt. He has short, dark hair and carries a backpack. The man is walking through a field of tall, dry grass, with his gaze directed forward. His expression is neutral, and he appears to be moving steadily through the landscape. The setting is natural, with bare trees visible in the distance, suggesting a late autumn or early winter environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it accurately describes the scene, its focus and structure are incorrect.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the man walking through a field, his clothing, and the background appears to be factually correct based on the text.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Partially Complete:** The caption describes the primary motion (walking) and a secondary motion (pushing grass aside). However, it omits any details about the pace or manner of walking, which could have added more value.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the following instructions:\n\n*   **Failed - Focus on Motion:** The core instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" Two of the four sentences in the caption are dedicated entirely to static descriptions: the man's clothing (\"He is wearing a light brown jacket...\") and the background scenery (\"The background consists of leafless trees...\"). This directly contradicts the rule.\n*   **Failed - Avoid Repeating Details:** The instructions state to avoid repeating details \"already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The sentences about clothing and the backpack are exactly the kind of static details that belong in a subject description, not a motion caption.\n*   **Failed - Conciseness:** By including irrelevant details about appearance and background, the caption is not as concise as it could be. The essential motion is described in only two fragmented parts of the paragraph.\n*   **Partially Failed - Specificity:** While \"pushing aside the grass with his hands\" is good and specific, \"A man is walking\" is a generic description. The instructions encourage more specific verbs (e.g., \"sprints\" instead of \"is running\"). The caption could have used a more descriptive verb if the video supported it (e.g., \"strides,\" \"trudges,\" \"ambles\").\n\n**In summary, the caption reads more like a general scene description than a focused motion caption. It buries the relevant motion details between sentences of static, non-essential information, directly violating the primary goal of the instructions.**\n\nA better caption following all the rules would be:\n\n**A man walks forward through a field of tall, dry grass, moving his arms and pushing the grass aside with his hands as he proceeds.**",
