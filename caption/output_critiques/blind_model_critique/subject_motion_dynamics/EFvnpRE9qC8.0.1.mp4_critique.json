    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with light skin and long, straight hair, wearing a sleeveless, ankle-length white dress and light-colored long socks without shoes. She stands upright in the center of the scene, sometimes looking toward the camera and then turning her head to the left side of the scene. Her hands are loosely clasped in front of her body, and her facial expression appears neutral. The lighting highlights her figure against a dark background, making her the clear focal point throughout the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The woman stands upright in the center of the scene with her hands loosely clasped in front of her body. She first looks toward the camera, then turns her head to the left side of the scene while maintaining her standing position. No other significant movement occurs.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nThis is an **excellent** caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is precise and objective. It describes a clear, verifiable sequence of actions (\"looks toward the camera, then turns her head\") without making any assumptions or interpretations.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption provides a full account of the motion in the video. It establishes the subject's initial static position, describes the primary movement, and confirms the lack of any other action, leaving no ambiguity.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly uses \"first... then\" to present the actions in the exact order they occur.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It successfully focuses on the subject's motion (the head turn) while using her static posture (\"stands upright,\" \"maintaining her standing position\") as a necessary baseline for describing that motion.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. It avoids jargon, abstract concepts, and emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely free of speculative language (\"appears to,\" \"might be\") and subjective descriptions.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n    *   **Handling Minimal Movement:** The final sentence, \"No other significant movement occurs,\" is an effective and concise way to confirm that the described action is the only one, which is a great way to handle videos with limited motion.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, concise, accurate, and strictly objective.",
