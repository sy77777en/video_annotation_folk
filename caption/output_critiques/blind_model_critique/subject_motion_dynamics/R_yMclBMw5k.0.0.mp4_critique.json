    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This abstract video showcases a flowing, curved stream of golden particles against a solid black background. The particles, which resemble glitter or dust, are of various sizes and shades of gold and yellow, with some appearing as bright, sparkling points of light. The stream moves in a gentle arc from the upper left towards the lower right. A shallow depth of field is employed, rendering some particles in sharp focus while others are softly blurred, creating a sense of dimension. A faint, warm light source in the upper right corner casts a subtle glow over the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a well-written, accurate, and highly effective description of the subject's motion that adheres almost perfectly to all the given instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is very accurate. It precisely describes the primary motion (\"A stream of golden particles flows in a... continuous arc\"), the direction of that motion (\"from the upper left, curving down towards the lower right\"), and the secondary motion of the individual components (\"individual particles drift and twinkle\"). The description of the overall effect as a \"slow and shimmering wave-like motion\" is also an accurate and objective summary of the visual event.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It captures all the essential aspects of the motion without getting lost in unnecessary detail. It successfully describes the collective behavior of the group (the stream) and the actions of the individuals within it (the particles), providing a comprehensive picture of the movement in the video.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, clear paragraph that effectively communicates the necessary information.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The motion is continuous, so the caption logically describes the overall flow first and then the details of the particles within it.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption is entirely focused on motion, using strong, descriptive verbs like \"flows,\" \"curving,\" \"drift,\" and \"twinkle.\"\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, simple, and easy to understand.\n*   **Avoids Subjectivity:** The caption does an excellent job of remaining objective. Words like \"slow\" and \"shimmering\" are descriptive of the physical properties of the motion, not emotional judgments. The word \"gentle\" is the only term that borders on subjective, but in this context, it effectively describes a slow, non-turbulent quality of motion and is acceptable.\n*   **Avoids Speculation and Ambiguity:** The description is direct and certain, avoiding any speculative language.\n*   **Describes Group Activity:** It perfectly follows the instruction to describe group activities with specificity, detailing how the \"stream of... particles flows\" and how the \"individual particles drift\" within that collective.\n*   **Avoids Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete visual details (\"flows in a... arc,\" \"drift and twinkle\") rather than abstract interpretations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and focused squarely on the subject's motion, resulting in a clear and high-quality video description.",
