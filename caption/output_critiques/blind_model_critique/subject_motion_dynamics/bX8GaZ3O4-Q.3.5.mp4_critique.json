    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A black, metallic semi-automatic handgun lies on its side on a dark wooden surface, its form highlighted by cool blue light. In the foreground, next to the gun, are two brass-cased bullets with silver-colored tips. Around the midpoint of the video, a colorful butterfly enters from the top right corner of the frame and flits toward the bottom left, appearing only briefly. Subsequently, a small, brightly colored tree frog, with a yellow back, a white underside, pinkish-red limbs, and large eyes with dark brown irises and a reddish-tinged sclera, hops into view from the top right edge. It lands on the gun's trigger guard, pauses momentarily while glancing upward toward the top right, and then leaps off toward the top left edge, disappearing from sight.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and their chronological actions, it could be more precise in describing the specifics of their movements and interactions. The description of the butterfly \"flitting\" is a good start, but it could be enhanced by detailing the path; for instance, the butterfly might flutter erratically across the upper portion of the frame before exiting, rather than moving in a simple diagonal line. The most significant area for improvement is the description of the frog's motion. The caption merges the frog's entrance and its landing on the gun into a single action. A more accurate description might involve the frog first hopping into the frame and landing on the surface next to the handgun, pausing to orient itself, and then performing a second, smaller hop onto the trigger guard. Furthermore, the \"brief pause\" on the gun is likely not completely static; the caption could mention a subtle movement, such as the frog shifting its weight or its throat pouch visibly pulsating. Finally, clarifying that the frog pushes off the gun with its hind legs for its final leap would provide a more detailed and dynamic account of its exit.",
