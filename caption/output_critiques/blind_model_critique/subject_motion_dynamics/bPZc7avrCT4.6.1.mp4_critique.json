    "pre_caption": "An older woman, initially holding a green, pliable object, extends her arms and pushes the object towards the head of a younger man standing to her right. The man, who is standing with his hands on his hips, closes his eyes as the green object makes contact with the side of his head, causing the object to deform.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **An older woman with short, white hair and fair skin, wearing a white t-shirt with a prominent red and blue American flag design, stands on the left. She is holding a green, somewhat deflated, pliable object resembling a water-filled balloon, which she then pushes towards the head of a younger man standing to her right. The man has short brown hair, a brown beard, and fair skin. He is wearing a red t-shirt with a graphic depicting a truck with an American flag design and the word \"USA\" above it. He stands with his hands on his hips, facing forward with a neutral expression, and closes his eyes as the green object makes contact with the side of his head and deforms.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects and follows a chronological sequence, it feels incomplete and could be more precise in its description of the motion. The term \"pushes\" is ambiguous; if the video shows a quick, playful strike, a word like \"swings\" or \"taps\" would more accurately describe the woman's action with the green object, which appears to be a foam pool noodle. The description ends abruptly at the moment of impact, failing to capture the full sequence of events. It omits the man's reaction beyond closing his eyes—for instance, he stumbles back a step from the force of the light blow and then breaks into a laugh. Furthermore, the caption doesn't describe what happens to the object after it deforms; the video shows the woman immediately pulling the noodle back as the man regains his balance. A complete description would include these subsequent movements to fully represent the interaction shown.",
