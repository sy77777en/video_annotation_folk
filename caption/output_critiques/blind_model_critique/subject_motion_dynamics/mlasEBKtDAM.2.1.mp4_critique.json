    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of several giant humanoid figures standing against a backdrop of clouds and a colorful sky. The central giant, with a muscular build, starts to raise its arms slowly. As the central giant continues to lift its arms, the other giants in the background also begin to move, with their arms and bodies shifting positions. The camera then pans downward, revealing a harbor with buildings and a docked ship, providing a sense of scale to the giants' massive size.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features several colossal humanoid figures with exposed muscles and no skin, towering over a cityscape. The main subject is a central giant, distinguished by its massive size and prominent muscular structure, standing upright with a forward-facing posture. Surrounding this figure are other similar giants, each displaying the same muscular appearance, with a fluid, similar in color to the muscles, flowing from their heads, contributing to a sense of overwhelming scale. In the foreground, a harbor with a docked ship and industrial buildings is visible, emphasizing the contrast between the giants and the human-made structures. The scene conveys a dramatic juxtaposition of the immense figures against the smaller, detailed city elements.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good but has one minor area for improvement. It successfully captures the essence of the video's motion in a clear and structured way.\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the events. It correctly identifies the subjects (giant humanoid figures), their initial state (standing), their specific movements (raising arms, shifting positions), and the camera's motion (panning downward). The description of the revealed scene (a harbor) is also precise.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is complete, providing a full chronological account of the motion within the video. It starts from the initial static scene, describes the progression of movement from the central figure to the others, and concludes with the camera movement that reframes the scene. It covers all significant actions from beginning to end.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but slightly deviates on one point.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a perfect, easy-to-follow sequence (\"begins with,\" \"starts to raise,\" \"continues to lift,\" \"then pans downward\").\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description centers on specific actions like \"raise its arms slowly,\" \"arms and bodies shifting positions,\" and \"pans downward,\" avoiding static descriptions where possible.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** It avoids ambiguous phrases (\"appears to be\") and emotional adjectives, sticking to objective facts visible in the video.\n*   **Group and Individual Action:** It effectively describes the main subject's motion (\"The central giant... starts to raise its arms\") before describing the collective action of the secondary subjects (\"the other giants... also begin to move\").\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n*   **Avoids Abstract Descriptions:** The caption violates this rule with its final phrase: \"...providing a sense of scale to the giants' massive size.\" This is an abstract interpretation of the *effect* of the camera pan, similar to the forbidden example \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\" The instruction is to describe only the visible motion and its direct result, not the cinematic purpose or feeling it evokes.\n\n**Revised Example (adhering to all rules):**\n\"Several giant humanoid figures stand against a cloudy sky. The central giant slowly raises its arms, and then the other giants in the background begin to shift their arms and bodies. The camera pans downward to reveal a harbor with buildings and a docked ship below the figures.\"",
