    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit basketball court, a man in a dark outfit catches a basketball and begins to dribble it. As he starts dribbling, the number of people in the background decreases rapidly, indicating a time-lapse effect. The man continues to dribble the ball while moving across the court, with the background becoming increasingly empty. The court is spacious with wooden flooring and dark blue markings, and the stands are mostly empty, emphasizing the man's solitary practice.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a bustling basketball court filled with numerous people. As the main subject, a man in a dark athletic outfit, catches the basketball, many of the other individuals disappear in a time-lapse effect. As he prepares to drive towards the basket, more people vanish, ultimately leaving him alone on the court. The setting is slightly dim, creating a more intimate and focused atmosphere for his practice session.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates several key instructions. While it correctly identifies the subject's actions in chronological order, it includes abstract interpretations and excessive scenic details that were explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the man catching and dribbling the basketball is accurate. The observation that people in the background decrease rapidly is also correct. The chronological order of events (catch, dribble, people disappear, continue dribbling) is accurate.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Mostly Complete:** The caption successfully captures the primary motion of the main subject (the man) and the significant motion-related effect in the background (the time-lapse).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following ways:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid abstract descriptions\":** The phrase \"**emphasizing the man's solitary practice**\" is an abstract interpretation of the video's mood or theme. The instructions explicitly forbid this (e.g., \"avoid abstract descriptions, such as 'emphasizing its speed and agility'\").\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details\":** The final sentence, \"**The court is spacious with wooden flooring and dark blue markings, and the stands are mostly empty...**\" is a detailed description of the static environment. The instructions require the focus to be on motion, not on scenic details that don't contribute to the description of the action.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase \"**indicating a time-lapse effect**\" is an interpretation of *how* the visual change is achieved, rather than a direct description of what is visibly happening. A more compliant description would be \"the number of people in the background rapidly decreases\" without naming the cinematic technique.\n*   **Violation of \"Concise\":** Due to the inclusion of forbidden abstract and scenic details, the caption is longer and less concise than it should be.",
