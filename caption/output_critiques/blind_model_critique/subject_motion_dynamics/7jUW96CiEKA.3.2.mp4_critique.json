    "pre_caption": "A bird with a gray body, white underparts, black wing markings, and a yellow beak is standing on a muddy surface. The bird begins to walk to the right, moving steadily across the muddy terrain. The bird continues its movement, maintaining a consistent pace and direction. The bird reaches a new part of the muddy surface, still moving to the right. The bird pauses briefly, then continues walking, showing no signs of stopping.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bird with a distinctive appearance, characterized by a gray body, white underparts, and black markings on its wings. It has a primarily yellow beak with a distinct black tip at its pointed end and long, slender legs, which are pale in color. The bird is seen standing and walking on a muddy surface, suggesting it is in a wetland or similar environment. Its posture is upright, and it appears to be foraging or exploring the area. The bird's head is turned slightly, indicating alertness or curiosity.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the sequence of events (standing, walking, pausing, walking) is chronologically accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption seems to cover the primary movements of the subject. However, its wordiness and repetition make it feel less complete and more drawn out than necessary.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several key instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The very first sentence is a detailed description of the bird's appearance (\"A bird with a gray body, white underparts, black wing markings, and a yellow beak...\"). The instructions explicitly state to \"focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" This is the most significant error.\n*   **Violation of \"Concise\":** The caption is repetitive and not concise. It uses multiple sentences to describe the single, continuous action of walking. For example, \"The bird begins to walk...\", \"The bird continues its movement...\", and \"The bird reaches a new part... still moving to the right\" could be combined into a single, more efficient phrase.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculative Statements\":** The final phrase, \"showing no signs of stopping,\" is a speculative interpretation of the bird's intent. The instruction is to describe only what is visible, not to infer future actions or intentions.\n\n### Summary\nThe caption is poor because it leads with a lengthy physical description, which is explicitly forbidden, and uses repetitive, wordy language to describe a simple motion, violating the rule for conciseness.\n\nA better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\n**A bird standing on a muddy surface begins to walk steadily to the right, pauses briefly, and then continues walking in the same direction.**",
