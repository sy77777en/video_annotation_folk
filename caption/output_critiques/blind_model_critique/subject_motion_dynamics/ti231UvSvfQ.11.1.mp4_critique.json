    "pre_caption": "A young man in a gray sweatshirt walks through a doorway and into a dimly lit room. As he moves forward, the camera pans to the right, revealing two other men in the background. One older man stands and leans over a small, yellow submersible device, while a younger, seated man in a beanie manipulates it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young, fair-skinned man with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark gray long-sleeved sweatshirt, walks into a dimly lit room with a concerned expression. As he moves, the focus shifts to the background, revealing two other men. One is an older, standing man with graying hair and a mustache, dressed in a dark jacket. Next to him is a younger, seated man wearing a black beanie and a dark shirt. Both men in the background are gathered around a small, yellow, submersible-like device.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the initial action and the camera movement, but it could be more specific about the subsequent interactions and the nature of the work being done. The term \"manipulates it\" is too generic; a more descriptive verb would clarify the action, such as \"operates a remote control\" or \"adjusts a component on the device.\" Furthermore, the caption describes the actions of the three men as separate events, but it's likely they are connected. For example, the older man might be standing up to greet the man who just entered the room, an interaction that is not mentioned. The description also leaves the first subject's motion incomplete; after he walks into the room and the camera pans, his subsequent action—whether he stops, approaches the others, or speaks—is omitted, leaving his role in the scene unresolved.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A young man in a gray sweatshirt walks through a doorway and into a dimly lit room. As he moves forward, the camera pans to the right, revealing two other men in the background. The older man stands up, possibly to greet the newcomer, and leans over a small, yellow submersible device. Meanwhile, the younger man in a beanie operates a remote control, skillfully adjusting the device. The young man in the sweatshirt approaches the others, suggesting a collaborative effort in their work.",
