    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man standing outside a building, leaning against a wall with his head down. He gradually moves his head and upper body slightly, indicating a shift in his posture. The man then begins to turn his body towards the camera, moving from a leaning position to a more upright stance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with short hair, wearing a light-colored sleeveless shirt. He appears to be leaning against a wall, with his head resting on it initially, and then he shifts to a more upright position. The man's posture and orientation suggest a moment of fatigue.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly follows a chronological order of the man's actions, it violates key instructions by including subjective interpretations of his internal state. Phrases like \"indicating fatigue\" and \"suggesting that he appears very tired\" are speculative and describe an emotional or physical condition that cannot be definitively observed from the video. The description should be limited to concrete, visible motions. For instance, instead of stating that he coughs \"indicating fatigue,\" the caption should simply state, \"He lowers his head and coughs.\" Furthermore, the description of his movements could be more precise and less wordy. The transition from leaning to standing is described in a roundabout way; a more direct description, such as \"He then pushes off the wall with both hands to stand upright before turning to face the camera,\" would be clearer and more focused on the specific motion. The current phrasing is slightly redundant in describing how he supports himself and then moves away from the wall.",
