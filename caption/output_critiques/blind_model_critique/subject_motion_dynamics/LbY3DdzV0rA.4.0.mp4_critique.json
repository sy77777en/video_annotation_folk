  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the camera's left-to-right panning motion but violates several key instructions. It relies heavily on subjective and emotional adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"turbulent,\" \"moody,\" and \"majestic,\" which are explicitly forbidden. Furthermore, the description focuses more on the static appearance of the landscape (\"vast, layered rock formations\") and sky (\"Large, white, and dark storm clouds\") rather than their motion. In the video I imagined, the clouds are not just present; they are actively churning and drifting across the frame, and the \"shafts of rain\" are visibly falling and shifting, not just static features. The caption should have described this movement, for example, by stating that \"storm clouds drift across the sky\" or \"rain falls in shifting curtains.\" The description of the camera's motion is also too generic; a more specific description, such as \"the camera pans slowly and steadily,\" would better capture the visual experience. A revised caption should eliminate all subjective language and focus entirely on describing the observable movements of the camera, clouds, and rain in a clear, chronological sequence.",

Storm clouds drift across the sky, and rain falls in shifting curtains over the landscape.
