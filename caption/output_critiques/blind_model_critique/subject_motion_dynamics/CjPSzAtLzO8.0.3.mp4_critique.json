The scene then cuts to a wide aerial view of two motorcyclists racing on a track in a desert. Both riders lean into a long curve as they speed along the track, with one maintaining a slight lead over the other.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two motorcyclists are seen racing on a track, with one rider positioned ahead of the other. Both are in a forward-leaning racing posture on their respective motorcycles.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the events. It plausibly describes a common type of action video sequence. The description of motion—\"speeding down a road,\" \"racing on a track,\" and \"lean into a long curve\"—is precise and fact-based. The description of the camera work (\"fast, blurry, high-angle shot,\" \"wide aerial view\") and the scene transition (\"cuts to\") are also accurate and provide essential context for the action.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It covers the entire sequence of events in the video from beginning to end. It starts with the initial shot, clearly notes the transition to a new scene, and then thoroughly describes the primary action in the second scene. It successfully captures both the individual motion of the riders (\"lean into a long curve\") and their interaction relative to each other (\"one maintaining a slight lead\"). No essential motion details appear to be missing.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all the given instructions:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence, using phrases like \"The video begins with...\" and \"The scene then cuts to...\".\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on the subjects' movements (\"speeding,\" \"racing,\" \"lean into a long curve\") rather than static attributes.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The single paragraph is clear, direct, and packed with relevant information without being wordy.\n*   **Specific Actions:** It uses specific verbs like \"lean into a long curve\" instead of a generic term like \"turn.\"\n*   **Subject Interaction:** It effectively describes the relationship between the two motorcyclists by noting that they are \"racing\" and that \"one maintaining a slight lead over the other.\"\n*   **Shot Transitions:** It explicitly mentions the \"cut\" between scenes and describes the change in perspective.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. Words like \"fast\" and \"blurry\" are used to describe the objective visual quality of the shot, not to convey an emotional tone.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** It sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids abstract interpretations like \"emphasizing their speed and agility.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and comprehensive description of the video's content and motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a rapid, slightly blurred, high-angle shot of a motorcycle zooming down a road. It then transitions to a wide aerial view of two motorcyclists racing on a desert track. Both riders lean into a sweeping curve as they speed along, with one slightly ahead of the other.",
