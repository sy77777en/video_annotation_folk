As an explosion occurs outside the window, the person in front quickly jumps to the left and descends the stairs.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two armed individuals dressed in full military gear, including camouflage uniforms, tactical vests, helmets, and backpacks. One person, whose hands and weapon are visible in the foreground, holds a black firearm and appears to be following the other, who is walking ahead and facing away. Both individuals are equipped with gloves and other standard combat accessories. Suddenly, the player in front jumps to the left and flies downstairs as an explosion occurs outside the window. In an instant, broken wooden boards, debris, flames, and smoke fill the field of vision, and the player is blown backwards, creating a tense, action-oriented environment involving military personnel navigating a hazardous area with significant destruction.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** Assuming the events described in the caption are a faithful representation of the video's content, the description is accurate. It details a clear sequence of actions involving two individuals and an explosion.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption appears to be complete, capturing the primary sequence of events from start to finish. It establishes the initial scene, describes the inciting incident (the explosion), the subject's immediate reaction, and the final consequence of the blast, providing a full narrative arc of the motion in the clip.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption is excellent and adheres very well to all the given instructions.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a perfect, logical sequence: one person follows another, an explosion happens, the front person reacts by jumping and descending, and is then blown backward by the force.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on motion. It uses strong, specific verbs like \"moves behind,\" \"walks ahead,\" \"jumps,\" \"descends,\" and \"blown backward\" to clearly articulate the actions.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is informative without being overly long or complex.\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. Adverbs like \"quickly\" and \"forcefully\" are used appropriately to describe the quality of the motion itself, rather than imputing an emotional state.\n*   **No Speculation:** The language is definitive and avoids any ambiguous or speculative phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Specificity of Interaction:** The caption excels at describing interactions. It details the interaction between the two people (\"moves behind another person, who walks ahead\") and the interaction between the subject and the environment (\"forcefully blown backward by the blast\").\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The description is concrete and factual, avoiding abstract interpretations of the scene's mood or the subject's agility.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly follows the provided guidelines. It is a clear, objective, and chronologically sound description of the subject's motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the foreground, a person holding a firearm moves behind another individual who is walking toward a staircase. As an explosion erupts outside the window, the person in front swiftly jumps to the left and descends the stairs. Debris, flames, and smoke engulf the area, and the person in front is violently propelled backward by the blast.",
