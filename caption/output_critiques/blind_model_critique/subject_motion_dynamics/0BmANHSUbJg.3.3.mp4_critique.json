    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a large cargo plane prominently positioned within an indoor setting. The aircraft is primarily white with small visible windows and metallic sections featuring rivets and a distinct nose. It bears the text \"NORSK FREIGHT\" on its side, indicating its purpose. The plane is surrounded by a cloud of smoke or mist, suggesting activity or a process occurring around it. In the foreground, there are several white cargo containers with red and black markings, labeled with \"N\" symbols, indicating their contents or handling instructions. The scene is illuminated by overhead industrial lights, casting a warm glow over the entire area. The setting appears to be a hangar or a similar facility, emphasizing the industrial and logistical nature of the subjects.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nThe provided caption is **excellent** and adheres exceptionally well to all the given instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a clear and plausible sequence of events. It correctly identifies the subjects (cargo plane, hangar) and their actions (explosion, moving backward, crashing).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It captures the entire motion sequence from the initial catalyst (the explosion) to the primary action (the plane crashing backward into the hangar) and the resulting consequences (flying debris, billowing smoke). It leaves no significant motion undescribed.\n\n*   -**Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows this rule, presenting the events in a logical sequence: explosion -> plane moves backward -> plane crashes -> debris flies -> smoke billows.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The language is highly action-oriented, using strong, specific verbs like \"occurs,\" \"moving backward rapidly,\" \"crashes through,\" \"sending debris flying,\" and \"billows.\"\n    *   **Specificity and Object Interaction:** It excels at describing the interaction between the subject and an object. Instead of a generic \"the plane hits the building,\" it specifies that the plane \"crashes through the hangar's large windowed structure,\" and details the effect: \"sending debris flying forward.\"\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is compact yet rich with essential details about the motion, providing a full picture of the event without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language. Words like \"large\" and \"rapidly\" are objective descriptors of scale and speed, not subjective opinions.\n    *   **Formatting and Style:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English, exactly as requested. It avoids abstract descriptions and focuses purely on the visible actions.",

The plane crashes through the hangar's expansive windowed structure, propelling debris forward as it enters the building.
