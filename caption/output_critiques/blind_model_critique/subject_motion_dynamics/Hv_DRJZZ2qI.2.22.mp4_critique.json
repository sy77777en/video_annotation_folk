    "pre_caption": "A mountain biker rides down a large, curved wooden ramp built into a canyon. Upon reaching the end of the ramp, the biker launches into the air, performing a complete backward flip with the bike. The biker then lands on a dirt path below the ramp structure and continues to ride down the hillside. In the background, several spectators stand still on a wooden platform and the surrounding hillside, observing the biker.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject is a mountain biker wearing a red long-sleeved jersey, dark pants, and a white helmet, who rides down a large wooden ramp structure built into a reddish-brown canyon. The biker launches into the air, performs a backflip with the bike, and lands on a dirt path below. Several other people are visible in the background, standing on a wooden platform and on the hillside above, watching the biker. The course includes multiple wooden ramps, and black flags with a white circular logo are placed along the route. A large sign with the \"Red Bull\" logo is visible on the rocks at the bottom of the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main actions in chronological order, it could be more specific about the quality of the motion, which is central to the video's impact. The description \"rides down\" is too generic; the biker likely drops in from a standstill and rapidly accelerates down the steep curve of the ramp. The most significant omission is in the description of the landing. The caption fails to mention the crucial motion of impact absorption, such as the biker bending their knees and elbows and the bike's suspension compressing deeply to cushion the force of landing from such a height. Furthermore, a video of this nature would almost certainly feature a slow-motion replay of the stunt. The caption should describe this editing choice, noting that the video transitions to slow-motion as the biker launches and rotates, then returns to real-time as they land and ride away, which is a key part of how the subject's motion is presented to the viewer.",
