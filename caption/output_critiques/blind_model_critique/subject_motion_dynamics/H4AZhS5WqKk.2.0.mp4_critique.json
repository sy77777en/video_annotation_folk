    "pre_caption": "Tom stands facing the glass, raises his right hand, and extends his index finger. He presses his finger against the glass and slowly traces a circular path, using his sharp nail to cut a complete circle in the glass in front of him. Tom maintains a steady posture throughout the motion, focusing on the action of cutting the circle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features an animated anthropomorphic cat with dark gray fur, a lighter gray face and chest, and large, pointed ears with pink interiors. The cat has prominent yellow eyes, a small black nose, and a white mouth and hands. Its expression is serious, with a slightly furrowed brow. This is the classic image of Tom the Cat from the animated series Tom and Jerry. Tom is depicted extending a finger of his right hand, using his sharp black nail to cut a circle on the glass in front of him. The setting suggests a cityscape, but the focus remains on Tom's distinctive appearance and gesture.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is good but has minor areas for improvement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the subject's actions. It correctly identifies the subject (\"Tom\"), the object he interacts with (\"the glass\"), and the specific sequence of movements involved in the action. It accurately portrays the outcome of the motion, which is cutting a circle in the glass.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It follows the entire action from the initial posture and preparation (standing, raising his hand) to the execution (pressing, tracing, cutting) and the state of the subject during the action (maintaining a steady posture). It successfully captures all the essential movements in chronological order.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions, but there are two minor violations:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are perfectly sequenced: \"stands... raises... extends... presses... traces... cut.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on Tom's physical movements.\n    *   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs like \"raises,\" \"extends,\" \"presses,\" and \"traces\" instead of generic terms.\n    *   **Object Interaction:** The interaction with the glass is described clearly and specifically (\"presses his finger against the glass,\" \"cut a complete circle in the glass\").\n    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Speculative Language:** The phrase \"**focusing on the action**\" describes a mental state or an internal focus rather than a visible physical motion. This violates the instruction to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain\" and to \"Avoid speculative statements.\" A better alternative would be to describe his observable behavior, such as \"he keeps his head still and watches his finger.\"\n    *   **Potentially Unverifiable Detail:** The adjective \"**sharp**\" in \"his sharp nail\" is an inference about the quality of the nail based on the result (cutting glass). The instructions state to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" While the nail is effective, its sharpness is an assumed property, not a directly observed visual detail. Simply stating he uses \"his nail\" or \"his fingernail\" would be more compliant.",
