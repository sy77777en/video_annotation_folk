    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with short, dark, wavy hair is seen from behind, wearing a dark, structured jacket. A light-colored dust or powder is scattered across his shoulders and upper back. He walks away from the camera down a dimly lit, green-hued corridor, his figure becoming a silhouette against the light at the far end.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a man and describes his motion as walking forward away from the camera. The details about the dust, the dimly lit green corridor, and the subject becoming a silhouette as he approaches a light source are precise visual observations that accurately reflect the described scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It covers the entire continuous action within the video, from the initial movement to the visual transformation caused by that movement relative to the light. It successfully captures the most salient motion (walking) and its primary consequence (becoming a silhouette) without omitting any crucial details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all the given instructions:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It describes a single, continuous action, and the description follows the man's progression down the corridor chronologically.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption is centered on the man's movement (\"walks forward,\" \"moves away,\" \"approaches the light\"). The description of the dust \"coming off his jacket\" is also an excellent detail of motion.\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The description is written in simple, natural English, forming a coherent and easy-to-understand paragraph.\n*   **Objective and Factual:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. Terms like \"steady pace,\" \"dimly lit,\" and \"green-hued\" are objective descriptions. It correctly avoids speculative language.\n*   **Specificity:** Instead of just \"a man walks,\" it specifies he \"walks forward at a steady pace,\" which is more descriptive. It also details the visual effect of his motion by noting that \"his figure becoming a silhouette.\"\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions and visual changes, avoiding abstract interpretations like \"creating a sense of mystery.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, objective, and focused entirely on the subject's motion.",
