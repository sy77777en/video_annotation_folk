  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the main subjects (storm cell, rain shaft) and the camera movement, but it could be more effective by adhering more closely to the instructions. The use of the subjective adjective \"dramatic\" should be avoided. More importantly, the description of motion lacks a clear chronological sequence, which is crucial for a time-lapse video. For instance, the video might show the storm cell first gathering and darkening on the left side of the frame, then the concentrated rain shaft forming and sweeping across the canyon floor, and finally, the entire system dissipating as it moves 오른쪽. The current caption lists the moving elements but doesn't narrate their progression. Additionally, the phrase \"movement of heavy clouds\" is too general; a more specific description, such as \"clouds swirl and expand\" or \"clouds roll across the canyon rim,\" would better capture the visual details. Finally, the caption could better integrate the subject's motion with the camera's pan, clarifying if the camera is panning to follow the storm or if the pan reveals the storm as it enters the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This wide-angle time-lapse captures a storm cell gathering and darkening on the left side of the frame over the Grand Canyon. As the clouds swirl and expand, a concentrated shaft of rain forms and sweeps across the canyon floor. The storm system gradually dissipates as it moves to the right. The camera remains stationary throughout the clip, providing a steady view of the storm's progression.",
