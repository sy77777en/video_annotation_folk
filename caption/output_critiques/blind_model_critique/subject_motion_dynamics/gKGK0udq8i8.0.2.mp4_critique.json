    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a parking lot with three parked cars. The first car, a beige sedan, is centrally positioned, while a silver SUV is parked to its left. A third car, partially visible on the right edge, is dark-colored. A metal cabinet falls to the ground, scattering numerous papers into the air, which eventually settle on the ground. The scene captures the moment of impact and the resulting disarray of papers.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres to all the provided instructions exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject (a metal cabinet), its motion (falling from above, breaking on impact), the consequence (contents scattering), and the state of the secondary subjects (stationary cars).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It captures the entire sequence of the event without leaving out essential details. It mentions the setting, the primary action, the result of the action, and the status of surrounding objects, providing a full picture of the motion in the video.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows the chronological flow of events: the cabinet is \"falling from above,\" then \"breaking apart as it hits the ground,\" and finally, its \"contents... scatter and fall.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on motion, using specific action verbs like \"falling,\" \"breaking apart,\" \"hits,\" \"scatter,\" \"fall,\" and \"crashes.\" It also correctly describes the lack of motion in the cars (\"remain stationary\").\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. It forms a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"violently,\" \"dramatically\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **Specificity:** It provides specific details about the actions, such as the cabinet \"breaking apart as it hits the ground\" and the papers \"scatter[ing] and fall[ing],\" which is much better than a generic statement like \"a cabinet falls and breaks.\"\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It correctly identifies the cabinet as the main subject and describes its motion in detail, while briefly and appropriately mentioning the secondary subjects (the cars) and their lack of movement.",
