    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (text boxes, rabbit-shaped objects) and describes their actions precisely. It notes the content of the text boxes (dialogue from John and River) which provides necessary context for the sequence of events.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete, capturing all the key motion-related events in the video. It doesn't miss any of the primary actions: the appearance of the first text box, the materialization of the objects, and the subsequent replacement of the first text box with the second.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given rules perfectly:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It masterfully presents the actions in the exact order they occur: first the text box appears, then the objects materialize, and finally the text box is replaced.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It uses strong, specific verbs that describe motion and transition, such as \"appears,\" \"materializes,\" \"vanishes,\" and \"is replaced.\" This is exactly what the instructions requested instead of describing a static scene.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, clear paragraph that packs in all the essential information without being wordy.\n*   **Objectivity and Specificity:** It avoids any subjective (\"surprising,\" \"magical\") or speculative (\"it seems to\") language. Descriptions like \"a large quantity of white, rabbit-shaped objects instantly materializes\" are specific, objective, and concrete.\n*   **Natural Language:** The sentence is well-structured and uses simple, natural English, making it easy to understand.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to describing the literal events on screen without interpreting them or adding abstract concepts.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is clear, accurate, and focuses effectively on describing the motion in chronological order.",
