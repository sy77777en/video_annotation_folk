    "pre_caption": "The video shows an older man with gray hair and a lined face, wearing a dark green sweater over a collared shirt, interacting with a boy. The man initially has his head lowered but gradually lifts it to look at the boy, maintaining a contemplative expression without smiling. The boy, with short dark hair, is seen from the back and slightly to the left, wearing a white shirt with a dark collar. The background is a plain wall with a small framed picture hanging on it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two individuals, an older man and a boy, engaged in a close interaction. The man, with gray hair and a lined face, wears a dark green sweater over a collared shirt. He initially has his head lowered before lifting it to look at the boy, maintaining a contemplative expression without smiling. The boy, with short dark hair, is seen from the back and slightly to the left, wearing a white shirt with a dark collar. Their proximity suggests a conversation or moment of connection, with the man looking at the boy attentively.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption accurately identifies the subjects but fails to describe the interaction with sufficient detail, making the scene feel static. It focuses on the man's motion but completely omits the boy's actions, which are likely the catalyst for the man's response. For instance, the video might show the boy first approaching the seated man and placing a hand on his shoulder, which then prompts the man to slowly lift his head. The description of the man's movement is also incomplete; it stops once he looks up, but he might then proceed to place his hand on the boy's arm or offer a slight nod. The use of the subjective term \"contemplative expression\" should be replaced with a more objective description of his facial movements, if any. A more effective caption would chronologically detail the cause-and-effect actions between both individuals, such as: \"A boy places his hand on an older man's shoulder, and the man, who is looking down, slowly raises his head to look at the boy before placing his own hand on the boy's arm.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A boy approaches an older man seated with his head lowered, gently placing a hand on the man's shoulder. In response, the man slowly lifts his head to meet the boy's gaze, his face remaining neutral. After a moment, the man places his hand on the boy's arm, acknowledging the boy's presence. The scene unfolds against a plain wall with a small framed picture hanging in the background.",
