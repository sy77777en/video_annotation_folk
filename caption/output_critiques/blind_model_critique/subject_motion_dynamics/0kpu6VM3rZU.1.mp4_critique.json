    "pre_caption": "The video shows a woman in a shiny, metallic gold dress holding a trophy in her right hand while engaging in conversation with another woman who holds a microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" The woman in the gold dress gestures with her left hand as she speaks, indicating active communication. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, remains relatively still, primarily holding the microphone steady. In the background, a crowd of formally dressed individuals moves subtly, contributing to the atmosphere of a red carpet event. The main subject's hand movements and the positioning of the microphone emphasize the interview setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially effective but fails to adhere to several key instructions. It is accurate in its description of the scene but violates rules regarding abstract descriptions, focus on motion, and conciseness.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately identifies the subjects (a woman in a gold dress, an interviewer, a crowd) and their primary actions (holding a trophy, holding a microphone, gesturing, speaking).\n*   **Completeness:** It successfully describes the main subject, a secondary subject, and background elements, which aligns with the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\nThe caption violates the following critical instructions:\n\n1.  **Avoid Abstract Descriptions:** The instructions explicitly forbid abstract descriptions like \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\" The provided caption contains several similar violations:\n    *   \"...**indicating active communication**.\" This is an interpretation of the gesture, not a description of the motion itself.\n    *   \"...**contributing to the atmosphere of a red carpet event**.\" This describes the effect of the crowd's presence, not their specific motion.\n    *   \"The main subject's hand movements and the positioning of the microphone **emphasize the interview setting**.\" This final sentence is entirely abstract and interpretive, explaining the meaning of the actions rather than describing the actions themselves.\n\n2.  **Focus on Motion Over Appearance:** The instructions state, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate.\" The caption is overly descriptive of appearances.\n    *   \"a shiny, metallic gold dress\"\n    *   \"a woman with long brown hair in an updo\"\n    These details are not necessary for differentiation. \"A woman in a gold dress\" and \"a woman holding a microphone\" would have been sufficient.\n\n3.  **Conciseness:** The inclusion of abstract interpretations and unnecessary appearance details makes the caption less concise than it should be. The entire last sentence should be removed.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to follow the core negative constraints of the instructions. While it correctly identifies the subjects and their basic actions, it pads the description with interpretive, abstract language and excessive details about appearance, both of which are explicitly forbidden. A better caption would focus purely on the observable, physical movements in chronological order.\n\n**Example of a better caption:**\n\nA woman in a gold dress holds a trophy in her right hand and speaks while gesturing with her left hand. She is facing another woman who holds a microphone steady. In the background, a crowd of people moves subtly.",
