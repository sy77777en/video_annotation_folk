    "pre_caption": "The video shows a woman in a shiny, metallic gold dress holding a trophy in her right hand while engaging in conversation with another woman who holds a microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" The woman in the gold dress gestures with her left hand as she speaks, indicating active communication. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, remains relatively still, primarily holding the microphone steady. In the background, a crowd of formally dressed individuals moves subtly, contributing to the atmosphere of a red carpet event. The main subject's hand movements and the positioning of the microphone emphasize the interview setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the scene but lacks specificity in describing the subjects' motions. The phrase \"engaging in conversation\" is too general; a more precise description might be that the woman in the gold dress is speaking animatedly, her mouth moving as she forms words. The description of her gesturing is also vague; the video could show her specifically raising her left hand to her chest as she makes a point, or perhaps pointing off-camera before bringing her hand back. The interviewer is described as \"relatively still,\" but she likely nods intermittently while listening or subtly shifts the microphone's position to better capture the audio, which are important micro-movements. Furthermore, the interaction with the trophy is understated; instead of just \"holding\" it, the main subject might be seen lifting it slightly for emphasis or shifting its grip in her hand as she speaks. Finally, the last sentence, \"The main subject's hand movements, gaze, and the positioning of the microphone emphasize the interview setting,\" is an abstract interpretation and should be removed in favor of describing only the concrete, observable actions that imply this context.",
