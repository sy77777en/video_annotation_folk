    "pre_caption": "A man remains suspended in mid-air, holding a tucked position with his knees drawn to his chest. While he stays mostly still, a fiery, glowing visual effect swirls and sparks around his body. The camera slowly circles him, moving from a frontal view to a side profile, revealing more of the surrounding space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A light-skinned, balding man, who appears to be middle-aged or older, is depicted as suspended mid-air in a tucked position, with his knees drawn up toward his torso and his arms hooked around his lower legs. He is barefoot and wears light blue striped pajamas. A glowing, fiery, orange-yellow visual effect surrounds his entire body in a roughly spherical form, appearing to spark and move around him.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subject's tucked position and the presence of a visual effect, but it could be more precise about the nature of the motion. While it states the man is \"mostly still,\" in the video, he performs a very slow, controlled rotation on his vertical axis, which is a key motion element that is missed. The description of the \"fiery, glowing visual effect\" is also too general; the video shows that the effect is not just around his body but seems to emanate from his core, pulsing rhythmically and casting a distinct, flickering orange light on his form and the immediate surroundings. Furthermore, the caption vaguely mentions \"revealing more of the surrounding space,\" but fails to describe what that space is. The camera's circular path clearly reveals that he is suspended in the center of a large, dark, and empty warehouse, with steel support beams becoming visible as the camera moves. A more complete description would incorporate the man's slow rotation, specify the origin and pulsing nature of the fiery effect, and identify the warehouse environment that is revealed by the camera's movement.",
