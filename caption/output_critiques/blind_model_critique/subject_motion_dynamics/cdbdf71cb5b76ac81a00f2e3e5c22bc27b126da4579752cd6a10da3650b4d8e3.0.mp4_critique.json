  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the primary subjects and the setting, but it fails to describe the motion with the required specificity. The phrase \"Three boats move across the scene, appearing one after the other\" is too general and does not detail the individual actions of each boat as instructed. For example, the video might show a sailboat gliding slowly from left to right far in the distance, followed by a speedboat entering from the right and moving quickly toward the left, leaving a white wake, before a small fishing boat chugs steadily from left to right closer to the shore. The caption should chronologically detail these distinct types of movement, including direction and relative speed. Furthermore, the caption violates the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives by using words like \"serene,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"calming.\" The description should be purely objective, focusing only on the observable actions, such as the gentle motion of the waves washing over the pebbles and the specific trajectories of each of the three boats as they cross the frame.",

A speedboat then enters from the right, moving quickly toward the left and leaving a white wake behind. Closer to the shore, a small fishing boat chugs steadily from left to right. The horizon stretches under a clear blue sky.",
