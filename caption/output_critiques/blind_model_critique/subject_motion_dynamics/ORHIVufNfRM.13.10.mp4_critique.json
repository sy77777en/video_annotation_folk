    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is a first-person perspective shot from within a diving suit or submersible, framed by the red edges of a mask or viewport. The only visible part of the person is their hands, which are covered in red gloves. The hands appear from the bottom of the frame and simply wave in the water. The small, glowing blue crystalline objects floating in the dark water appear to be groups of fish.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies two distinct subjects (hands in gloves, glowing blue objects) and describes their separate motions precisely. It accurately portrays the hands' movement as \"rising\" and \"waving\" and the objects' movement as \"drifting slowly.\"\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It describes the initial action of the hands entering the frame, their subsequent motion, and the continuous, collective movement of the other objects in the scene. It covers all the essential motion without leaving out key details.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to the given instructions.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence: the hands \"rise into view\" and then \"wave.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on motion (\"rise,\" \"wave,\" \"drift,\" \"moving together\"). It avoids static descriptions of appearance, only mentioning \"red gloves\" and \"glowing blue objects\" for necessary identification.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs. Instead of \"hands move,\" it says they \"rise\" and \"wave gently.\" For the group, instead of \"objects are floating,\" it specifies they \"drift slowly... moving together in loose clusters,\" which is an excellent example of describing collective behavior as requested.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct, forming a clear and coherent paragraph.\n*   **Avoidance of Prohibited Elements:** The caption successfully avoids speculation, emotional adjectives (\"gently\" is a borderline but acceptable descriptor of the type of motion), and abstract descriptions.\n*   **Revealing Subjects:** It perfectly follows the instruction to describe how subjects are revealed by stating the hands \"rise into view from the bottom of the frame.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and informative description of the video's content.",
