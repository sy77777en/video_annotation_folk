    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In an extreme close-up, a person with light skin and a brown eye looks intently into the eyepiece of an optical instrument. Their eye is wide, and their long eyelashes are clearly visible. A few strands of light brown or blonde hair are visible near their temple. The out-of-focus instrument they are looking through is dark with a golden, ribbed section near the person's eye. The scene is dimly lit with warm light highlighting the side of the person's face.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully captures the central contrast between the subject's unsteadiness and their focused gaze. However, it lacks specificity and violates a few key instructions. The term \"optical instrument\" is too generic; the video would likely show a specific device like a telescope on a tripod or handheld binoculars, and naming it would provide crucial context. The phrase \"appears unsteady\" is speculative and should be replaced with a direct description of the motion, such as \"vibrates\" or \"shakes.\" The description also conflates what are likely two different shots—a medium shot showing the person's head and the instrument shaking, and an extreme close-up of the eye. A more accurate caption would describe the action chronologically according to the shots. For example, if the person is outdoors at night, a better description would be: \"A person looking through a telescope shivers, causing their head and the instrument to shake. The shot then cuts to a close-up of their eye, which remains held steadily against the eyepiece.\" This revised version is more specific, avoids speculation, and accurately reflects the potential editing of the video.",
