    "pre_caption": "The video shows a group of five individuals dressed in white outfits with orange stripes, standing in front of a black screen. One of the individuals, wearing a red top hat, is prominently positioned in the center, leaning towards the screen. The person on the left, who is holding the small black rectangular screen, begins to move it towards the center. The other four individuals lean in closer to observe the screen as the person continues to move it. The person on the left successfully places the screen in the center, and the group continues to focus on it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes, including hoods that cover their heads. One stands out by wearing a tall red top hat. While four individuals gather closely, their attention is focused on a human-like object held by the person on the left, rather than the small black rectangular screen. The fifth person, positioned at the top right, appears to be working independently.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially effective** but fails to follow several key instructions. While it accurately describes a sequence of events in chronological order, it includes unnecessary details and violates the core principle of focusing primarily on motion.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** Assuming the video content matches the description, the caption correctly identifies the subjects, the key object (a screen), and the sequence of actions.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Complete:** The caption describes the entire motion arc within the video: the initial state, the primary action of moving the screen, the group's reaction, and the final state.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the caption adheres to or violates the specific instructions:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are correctly presented in the order they occur: a person moves a screen, others lean in, the screen is placed, and the group watches.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The description is objective and avoids ambiguous or emotional language (e.g., \"successfully places,\" while slightly evaluative, is acceptable in context).\n*   **Describes Interactions:** It clearly describes the interaction between one person and the screen, as well as the collective reaction of the group (\"lean in closer to observe\").\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Violation: Focus on Motion:** The caption's primary failure is its lack of focus on motion. The first two sentences are dedicated entirely to static descriptions: what the subjects are wearing, where they are standing, and the initial pose of the central person. The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The description should begin with the first movement.\n*   **Violation: Unnecessary Detail:** Describing the \"white outfits with orange stripes\" is an unnecessary appearance detail that does not help differentiate the subjects or explain the motion. This static information should be omitted.\n*   **Violation: Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is redundant and explicitly forbidden by the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** The phrasing is somewhat wordy. For example, \"The person on the left, who is holding the small black rectangular screen, begins to move it...\" could be more direct.\n\n### Improved Version Following Instructions\n\nFor comparison, here is a revised caption that adheres to all the instructions:\n\nA person on the left moves a small black rectangular screen toward the center of a group of five people. As the screen moves, the other four individuals, including one in a red top hat, lean in closer to observe it. The person on the left then places the screen in the center, and the entire group continues to focus on it.",
