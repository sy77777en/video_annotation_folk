    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A video game character with a slender build and dark-colored hair is shown on a rocky cliff face. The character is wearing white and brown clothing and has a long, staff-like object on its back. It is positioned in mid-air, as if jumping or climbing between ledges. On a separate ledge to the right, there is a small cluster of dark, round objects and a single red, mushroom-like object.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject and the general direction of movement from right to left. However, it violates the instructions by including a speculative statement about the uncertainty of the jump's trajectory (\"though the video does not clearly indicate if the movement is from a lower to a higher position\"). The description of the motion is also somewhat static, focusing on the character being \"suspended in mid-jump\" rather than describing the full, dynamic action. A better caption would describe the entire motion chronologically. For example, it could detail the character pushing off the initial ledge, the specific arc of their travel across the chasm, and their body's preparation for landing on the opposite side. Using more descriptive action verbs to detail the character's posture during the jump, such as \"tucking its legs\" or \"extending its arms forward,\" would provide a clearer and more specific account of the motion as instructed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video game character pushes off from a lower ledge on the left, launching into the air with a powerful leap. As it arcs gracefully over the chasm, the character tucks its legs and extends its arms forward, preparing for a precise landing on the higher rocky ledge on the right.",
