    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera moves forward with several other pedestrians as they walk across a city street on a crosswalk. A person on a bicycle rides across the intersection in front of the group. In the background, other people cross the street, and vehicles, including a stopped police car and a moving yellow taxi, are visible in the intersection.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the initial camera tilt, it lacks specificity in describing the subjects' motion and their interactions. The phrase \"various individuals walking\" is too generic; a more effective description would detail the collective movement, such as \"a crowd of people walks from the right to the left side of the frame across the crosswalk.\" The description of the cyclist and the man in yellow shorts is ambiguous; stating the cyclist is \"just ahead of\" the man describes a spatial position rather than a chronological action. It would be clearer to describe their distinct paths, for instance, \"a person on a bicycle rides from left to right through the intersection, passing in front of a man in yellow shorts who walks toward the camera.\" Furthermore, the caption mentions the camera tilt but misses the opportunity to describe what this action reveals, such as tilting down from a traffic light to the street below. Finally, while the stopped vehicles are noted, their role in the scene could be clarified by stating they are stopped for the pedestrians, which would better integrate them into the overall description of movement.",

A crowd of people walks from the right to the left side of the frame across the crosswalk.

In the background, other pedestrians cross the street, while vehicles, including a stopped police car and a moving yellow taxi, are visible in the intersection, halted to allow the pedestrians to pass.",
