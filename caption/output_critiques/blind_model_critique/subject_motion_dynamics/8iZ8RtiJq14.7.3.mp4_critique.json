    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A close-up shot reveals a beige and grey corkboard surface. A red, twisted string is stretched across the scene, initially out of focus. As the camera's focus shifts, the red string becomes partially clear, along with a small, white piece of paper positioned beneath it. On the paper, the word \"UNCLE JERRY\" is printed in black, capital letters. The white piece of paper is pinned by a red thumbtack, with many red strings connected to this thumbtack and radiating in all directions. Additionally, there is another red piece of paper beneath the strings to the right of the white piece.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies that the primary \"motion\" in the video is not the movement of an object, but the change in the camera's focus. It accurately describes this action as a slow shift from a blurry background to a sharp foreground, a technique known as a focus pull.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It covers the entire event chronologically:\n*   It starts with the initial state (blurry background).\n*   It describes the process of the focus changing.\n*   It details what is revealed as the focus shifts (string, then paper with text).\n*   It concludes by confirming the state of the objects themselves (\"remain stationary\"), which is a crucial detail about their motion (or lack thereof).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption is a model example of following the instructions precisely:\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the sequence of events: focus shifts -> string becomes clear -> paper becomes clear.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly interprets \"motion\" to include camera effects like a focus pull, which is the most salient action in the video. It then explicitly addresses the lack of motion in the subjects, as instructed.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is brief yet provides all the essential information about what happens in the video.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** It uses objective language (\"slowly shifts,\" \"becomes clear,\" \"stationary\") and avoids any emotional or ambiguous terms.\n*   **Specific Actions:** Instead of a generic \"the camera focuses,\" it gives a specific and descriptive account: \"The camera's focus slowly shifts from a blurry, indistinct background to a sharp foreground.\"\n*   **Revealing Subjects:** It clearly describes the objects being \"revealed\" by the action, as per the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is outstanding because it intelligently interprets the instructions for a video where the \"action\" is unconventional. It focuses on the camera's motion, describes the resulting reveal chronologically, and confirms the static nature of the objects, resulting in a clear, accurate, and comprehensive description.",
