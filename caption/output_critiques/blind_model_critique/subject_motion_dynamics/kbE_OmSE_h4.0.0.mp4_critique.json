    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A white woman with blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail is shown figure skating. She is wearing a long-sleeved, turquoise leotard decorated with sequins and featuring a sheer, nude-colored panel on the chest. While on the ice, she faces the camera with a focused expression, extending both arms. At one point, she raises one arm while lowering the other, alternating them in circular motions.**",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption's description of the skater's initial state as \"keeps still\" is likely inaccurate; in a video of figure skating, she is more probably gliding or moving across the ice, even if slowly, and this core skating motion is omitted. The phrase \"extends both arms all the time\" is contradictory to the subsequent description of her raising and lowering them, and it should instead describe her initial pose before the arm movement begins. Furthermore, the description of the arm movement as \"alternating in a fluid motion\" is too generic and lacks specificity about how this relates to her movement on the ice, such as whether she is skating forward or performing a specific step sequence. The most significant omission is the complete failure to describe the skater's actions after the camera angle changes; the caption mentions the cut to an overhead shot but provides no information about what the skater is doing in that view, which could plausibly be a key element like a fast spin or a spiral, leaving the video's second half entirely undescribed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A female figure skater, initially gliding slowly and facing the camera, begins to skate forward. She starts with both arms extended gracefully, then raises one arm in a fluid motion as she continues her forward glide. The camera angle shifts to an overhead shot, capturing her as she performs a graceful spiral, extending one arm down towards the ice surface while maintaining her elegant movement across the rink.",
