    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A middle-aged, fair-skinned man with short brown hair, a receding hairline, a mustache, and a goatee stands on a wooden stage. He is wearing a light-colored button-down shirt, dark trousers, and a lanyard with an ID card. Behind him, a large projection screen shows a black-and-white photograph of a smiling young boy with light, wavy hair, alongside a color image of a vintage reel-to-reel tape recorder. The text \"11 Years-Old\" and \"Hypnopaedia\" is visible on the screen. A large white banner with the \"TEDx LingnanUniversity\" logo is positioned to his right side, and the same logo appears on a black banner affixed to a wooden lectern located in the lower right corner of the foreground. In the front row, the lower body of a person wearing dark trousers and shoes can be seen sitting with their legs crossed.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. The description of the man \"standing in place\" is likely too static; in a speaking engagement, the subject often paces across the stage, shifts his weight, or leans on a podium, and capturing this movement would provide a more accurate account. The phrase \"gesturing with his hands\" is too generic and could be improved by specifying the nature of the gestures—for instance, does he point emphatically at the audience, use a clicker to change slides on a screen behind him, or make broad, sweeping motions to illustrate a point? Furthermore, describing the audience as \"motionless\" is improbable, as even a quiet crowd would exhibit subtle movements like nodding, taking notes, or shifting in their seats. A more dynamic description might note that the audience sits attentively, occasionally applauding or reacting to the speaker's words. Finally, the term \"situated in the middle ground\" is a compositional detail rather than a description of motion and could be replaced by describing the audience's position relative to the action, such as \"seated in rows before the stage.\"",
