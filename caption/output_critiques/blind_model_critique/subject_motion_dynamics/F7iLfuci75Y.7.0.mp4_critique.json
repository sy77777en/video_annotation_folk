    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A vast, organized array of disembodied, stylized white hands are shown actively typing on black keyboards. Each pair of smooth, matte-finished hands is positioned over a black, rectangular keyboard with teal-green backlit keys. In every instance, a black, modern computer mouse with matching teal-green accents sits to the side of a keyboard. The setups are arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each station illuminated by a circular spotlight against a completely dark background, creating the impression of an endless, uniform workforce.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and adheres very well to all the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (\"disembodied white hands\"), their specific action (\"continuously type on keyboards\"), the nature of their movement (\"fingers moving rapidly and independently\"), and the camera's motion (\"slowly zooms out\"). The description of what is revealed by the zoom (\"an ever-expanding grid of identical typing stations\") is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete. It captures the two main motion events in the correct **chronological order**: first, the continuous action of the hands typing, and second, the camera movement that changes the viewer's perspective and reveals the scale of the scene. It successfully describes the essential details without getting bogged down in unnecessary information.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption excels here, describing not just *that* the hands are typing, but *how* they are typing (\"fingers moving rapidly and independently\"). It also correctly includes the camera's motion.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The sequence of events (typing, then zooming out) is presented logically.\n    *   **Specificity:** It uses specific language like \"press the keys\" and \"type on keyboards\" (object interaction) and describes the collective action of the group (\"work in unison\").\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The paragraph is clear, well-structured, and uses simple, natural English.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"eerie,\" \"impressive\") and speculative language (\"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids abstract interpretations like \"symbolizing the digital age.\"\n    *   **Revealing Subjects:** It perfectly follows the instruction to describe how subjects are revealed, noting that the zoom \"reveal[s] an ever-expanding grid.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is factual, descriptive, and focuses entirely on the motion within the video in a clear and chronological manner.",
