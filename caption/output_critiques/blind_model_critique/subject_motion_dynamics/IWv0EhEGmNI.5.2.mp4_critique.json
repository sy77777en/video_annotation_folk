    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A first-person perspective from a video game shows a player character holding a modern assault rifle equipped with a holographic sight. The character's hands are covered in light-colored gloves. The entire scene is rendered in a green-tinted night vision mode. On-screen text displays the objective \"Find Hadir.\" A waypoint marker on the left indicates a location named \"Search Church\" at a distance of 114 meters. A compass is visible at the top of the screen, and a \"Checkpoint reached\" notification appears briefly.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective and precisely describes the sequence of camera movements: a stationary start, a turn to the right, and continuous forward motion.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete, covering the entire motion within the video from beginning to end. It mentions key environmental elements (\"large pillar,\" \"stone path,\" \"building\") only to give context to the described motion, which is appropriate.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly adheres to all the given rules.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** It presents the actions in the correct sequence: \"initially remains stationary... then turns to the right and advances... continuing this forward movement.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The entire description is dedicated to the motion of the camera's viewpoint, successfully avoiding other details.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct, resulting in a clear and concise paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It is entirely objective, avoiding any emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n    *   **Specificity:** It describes the motion with specific actions (\"turns to the right,\" \"advances forward\") rather than vague terms like \"the camera moves.\"\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, unformatted paragraph as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is concise, informative, accurate, and strictly adheres to every constraint.",
