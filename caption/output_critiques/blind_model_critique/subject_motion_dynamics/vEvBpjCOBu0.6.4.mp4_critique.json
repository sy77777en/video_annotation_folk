    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a distant view of a transparent container placed on a perforated surface, containing a glass cup. As the camera moves closer, the details of the container and the glass cup become more visible. The hand holding the green electrical plug remains in the frame, indicating an ongoing interaction with the setup. The camera continues to zoom in, focusing more on the glass cup inside the container, while the hand and the other person's arm remain in view. The video concludes with a close-up of the glass cup, highlighting its details within the container.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a scientific setup in a laboratory setting. Central to the scene is a transparent container placed on a perforated surface, containing a glass cup. The container is the primary focus, with its details becoming clearer as the camera moves closer. On the left, a hand, wearing a white glove, holds a green electrical plug, suggesting an interaction with the setup. On the right, a small part of another humanoid figure's arm is visible, also clad in white, indicating the presence of another person. The background is dark, emphasizing the laboratory equipment and the actions of the individuals involved.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption focuses too heavily on the camera's movement rather than the subject's actions, which is the primary instruction. The description of the hand's action is particularly weak; stating it \"is in the frame, suggesting an interaction\" is both speculative and vague, violating the rule to avoid interpretation and describe concrete motion. A more effective caption would specify what the hand *does* with the plug—for example, it might insert the plug into a socket on the device or beneath the surface. Furthermore, the caption fails to connect the hand's action to the subsequent camera zoom on the cup. It's highly probable that plugging in the device initiates an event within the cup, such as the liquid starting to bubble, a light turning on, or a small mechanism beginning to stir. By omitting this likely reaction, the caption misses the core event of the video and makes the camera's zoom feel unmotivated. The description should chronologically link the cause (plugging in the device) with the effect (the reaction in the cup) to provide a complete and informative account of the subject's motion and interaction.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a distant view of a transparent container placed on a perforated surface, containing a glass cup. As the camera moves closer, a hand holding a green electrical plug is seen inserting it into a socket on the device beneath the surface. This action triggers a reaction within the glass cup, such as the liquid starting to bubble or a light turning on. The camera zooms in to capture these changes, focusing on the glass cup inside the container. The video concludes with a close-up of the glass cup, highlighting the details of the reaction within the container.",
