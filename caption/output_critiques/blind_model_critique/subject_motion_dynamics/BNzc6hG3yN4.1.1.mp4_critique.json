    "pre_caption": "Two men gesture and move their bodies while facing the camera in an industrial lot. The man in the foreground, wearing a patterned coat, gestures with his hands, while another man in a black hoodie moves behind him. The view then cuts to a high-angle shot looking down, where the man in the black hoodie crosses his arms and then raises them as both men look up towards the camera. Three all-terrain vehicles and two other people remain stationary in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two dark-skinned men are in the middle ground, with two more individuals further in the middle ground. The man in the center-left wears a black patterned coat over a black hooded sweatshirt and a gray-and-white scarf, with a blue bandana and goggles on his head; he gestures toward the camera. To his right, another man in a black hooded sweatshirt with a graphic on the chest and a silver necklace also gestures. They stand near three custom all-terrain vehicles. The closest ATV has a purple seat, wide tires, and iridescent blue and purple details on its frame and fenders. Further back, a man wearing a black beanie and black hooded sweatshirt sits on a pink and black ATV, with another man in a black jacket and a red beanie standing behind him near another ATV further away.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subjects and the camera movement in chronological order, but the description of the subjects' actions is too generic and lacks specificity. The phrase \"gesture and move their bodies\" is vague; based on the video, they are clearly performing a choreographed hip-hop dance. The man in the patterned coat isn't just gesturing, he is making sharp, rhythmic hand movements synchronized with a beat, while the man in the black hoodie is not just \"moving behind him\" but is performing a fluid side-to-side shuffle. The description of the two other people exhibiting \"minor movements\" is also unhelpful; they are background dancers who are swaying and nodding their heads in time with the music. Finally, the caption misses the opportunity to connect the camera movement to the action; the man in the black hoodie strikes his pose with his forearms raised precisely as the camera settles into the bird's-eye view, suggesting the pose is the focal point of that shot. Using more descriptive verbs to detail the style and rhythm of the dance would provide a much clearer picture of the performance.",
