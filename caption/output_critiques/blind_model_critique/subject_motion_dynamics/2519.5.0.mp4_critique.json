    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room, a man turns around and reaches for a hammer hanging on the wall. He takes the hammer and starts hitting the mechanical device in front of him. After removing a part of the device, he drops it and continues to search through the machine. The man then squats down, stands up, and turns his head angrily to the left, with the light illuminating his face and the device.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a dimly lit setting with short, dark hair, wearing a dark jacket over a sweater with a collared shirt underneath. He is using a hammer to strike a complex mechanical device with visible wires and components. After removing a part of the device with the hammer, he drops it and searches through the machine. He then squats down, stands up, and turns his head angrily to his left, which is the right side of the frame. The lighting casts a beam on him, highlighting his profile and the device.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is mostly good. It successfully describes the subject's actions in chronological order and focuses on motion. However, it fails on one key instruction by including a subjective, emotional adjective and adds a minor detail that is not related to motion.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events. The actions (turning, reaching, hitting, dropping, searching, squatting, turning head) are distinct and logically ordered, creating a clear picture of the man's interaction with his environment.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a complete narrative of the subject's motion within the described scene. It covers the entire sequence from acquiring a tool to a final, distinct movement, leaving no obvious gaps in the action.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at presenting the actions in the precise order they occur: \"turns around and reaches,\" \"takes the hammer and starts hitting,\" \"removing a part... he drops it,\" \"squats down, stands up, and turns his head.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It effectively uses action verbs to describe specific movements (\"turns,\" \"reaches,\" \"hitting,\" \"removing,\" \"drops,\" \"squats,\" \"stands up\").\n    *   **Object Interaction:** The interaction with the hammer and the mechanical device is described clearly and specifically (\"reaches for a hammer,\" \"starts hitting the mechanical device,\" \"removing a part of the device\").\n    *   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple, and the description is contained within a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjective:** The caption violates the rule **\"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"** The word **\"angrily\"** (\"turns his head angrily to the left\") is an interpretation of the man's emotional state, not an objective description of his motion. The instruction requires describing *how* he moves, not *why* or *how he feels*.\n    *   **Inclusion of Non-Motion Details:** The final phrase, **\"with the light illuminating his face and the device,\"** describes a lighting effect, not the subject's motion. The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included\" and to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" While the lighting is visible, it is not a part of the man's physical action.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is strong in its structure, clarity, and chronological description of motion. To be fully compliant with the instructions, it should be revised to remove the subjective word \"angrily\" and the non-essential detail about the lighting.\n\n**A corrected version would be:**\n\nA man in a dimly lit room turns around and reaches for a hammer hanging on the wall. He takes the hammer and hits a mechanical device in front of him. After removing a part of the device, he drops it and searches through the machine. The man then squats down, stands up, and turns his head to the left.",
