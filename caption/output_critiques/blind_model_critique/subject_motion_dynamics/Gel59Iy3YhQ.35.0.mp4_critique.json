    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large, angular figure with a brown-green color and three illuminated eyes in blue, pink, and green, moving across a stone platform. It swings a fiery weapon, creating a trail of flames. Nearby, a smaller, fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic, dodges the attack by swiftly moving to the side. The setting is a stylized, animated environment with a stone platform and surrounding walls.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two main subjects. The first is a large figure with a brown-green color and a non-humanoid appearance. It has an imposing presence and is constructed from angular shapes, featuring three illuminated objects resembling eyes in blue, pink, and green. The second subject is a smaller, fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic. This creature is positioned near the larger figure, highlighting a stark contrast in size and form. Both subjects exhibit a stylized, animated design, contributing to their atypical and striking appearances.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially good** but has several areas where it fails to adhere to the specific instructions. It successfully describes the actions chronologically and specifies the interaction between subjects, but it includes unnecessary details and lacks a primary focus on motion.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption describes a clear and plausible sequence of events. The description of the characters and their actions is specific and internally consistent.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Complete:** The caption covers the essential interaction in the video: one character attacks, and the other reacts. It establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two subjects' movements.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence: the large figure moves, swings its weapon, and then the smaller creature dodges.\n*   **Specific Interactions:** It clearly describes the interaction between the subjects (\"dodges the attack\") and the interaction with an object (\"swings a fiery weapon, creating a trail of flames\").\n*   **No Speculation or Emotion:** The language is objective and avoids subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Appearance:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption dedicates a significant portion of its length to describing the physical appearance of both characters (e.g., \"large, angular figure with a brown-green color and three illuminated eyes,\" \"fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic\"). This level of detail on appearance detracts from the main focus on motion.\n*   **Generic Motion Description:** The first described movement, \"moving across a stone platform,\" is too generic. The instructions ask for specific actions (e.g., \"sprints,\" \"operates a jackhammer\") rather than general ones like \"moving.\"\n*   **Inclusion of Unnecessary Details:** The final sentence, \"The setting is a stylized, animated environment with a stone platform and surrounding walls,\" describes the static scenery. The instructions state to focus on subject motion unless the video is a scenery shot, which is not the case here.\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...,\" which is an unnecessary introductory phrase. The instructions ask for the description itself, not a sentence introducing it.\n\n---\n\n### **Example of a Better Caption:**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more closely follows the instructions, assuming the same video content:\n\nA large, angular figure strides across a stone platform and swings a fiery weapon, which leaves a trail of flames. A smaller, fox-like creature dodges the swing by leaping to the side.",
