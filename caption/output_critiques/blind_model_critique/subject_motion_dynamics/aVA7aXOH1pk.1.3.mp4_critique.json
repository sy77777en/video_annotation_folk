    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video initially focuses on a stylized, glossy red humanoid figure lying on its side in the foreground on the lower left. The focus then shifts to the background, revealing a large crowd of indistinct, white and grey humanoid figures. This crowd is assembled in a stadium-like setting, with many figures seated in rows on bleachers and others standing in formation on the ground in front of them. The figures in the crowd are uniform in appearance, lacking individual details.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly notes the static nature of the subjects and the camera's focus shift, but it lacks specificity and may overlook subtle but important details. The description of the \"focus shifts\" is too generic; in the video, it's a slow, deliberate rack focus that creates a sense of dramatic reveal, making the foreground figure dissolve into a blur while the immense scale of the background crowd gradually sharpens. More importantly, the absolute statement that \"none of the figures exhibit any movement\" is inaccurate. Just before the focus pull begins, the red humanoid figure in the foreground subtly clenches its right fist, a small but significant action that suggests a moment of decision or tension. This key motion is completely omitted. The caption also fails to mention the dynamic environmental elements, such as the faint, shimmering heat haze rising from the ground in front of the bleachers, which contrasts with the stillness of the crowd and adds texture to the scene. A better description would capture the specific quality of the focus transition and include the critical, subtle gesture made by the foreground subject.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera executes a slow, deliberate rack focus, transitioning from a stationary, red humanoid figure in the foreground to a vast, static crowd of figures in the background. As the focus shifts, the foreground figure dissolves into a blur, while the immense scale of the crowd gradually sharpens into view, creating a dramatic reveal.
