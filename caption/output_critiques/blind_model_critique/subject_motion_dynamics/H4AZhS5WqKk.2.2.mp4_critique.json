    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two animated characters: a large blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with white paws, a white face, and pink inner ears, and a small brown mouse with large ears and a tan belly. The cat, named Tom, is standing on a bed and is focused on the mouse, named Jerry, who is trapped inside an upside-down transparent goblet on the pillow beside a black remote control. Tom eagerly wraps Jerry in a white cloth with both hands. Holding the bundled package in his left hand, Tom jumps off the bed, highlighting the dynamic between the two characters.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** Tom stands on the bed and reaches toward Jerry, who is trapped under an upside-down goblet on the pillow next to a remote control. Tom uses both hands to wrap Jerry in a white cloth, lifts the bundled mouse in his left hand, and then jumps off the bed while holding Jerry.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It describes a clear sequence of events involving two distinct subjects (Tom and Jerry) and their interaction with objects (goblet, cloth). The actions are specific and fact-based.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete, capturing the entire motion sequence from the beginning to the end of the clip. It establishes the initial positions and states of the subjects, describes the main interaction, and concludes with the final action.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** Perfect. The actions are presented in the exact order they occur: stands/reaches -> wraps -> lifts -> jumps.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** Excellent. The caption is built around strong, specific action verbs (\"reaches,\" \"wrap,\" \"lifts,\" \"jumps\"). While it includes static details (\"trapped under an upside-down goblet\"), this information is essential context for understanding the purpose of Tom's motion and is not a flaw.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is both concise and highly informative.\n    *   **Objectivity:** Perfect. It avoids all emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n    *   **Specificity:** Excellent. It clearly describes *how* the actions are performed (\"uses both hands to wrap,\" \"lifts the bundled mouse in his left hand,\" \"jumps off the bed while holding Jerry\"). This level of detail aligns perfectly with the instructions.\n    *   **Interaction:** The interaction between Tom and Jerry, as well as Tom's interaction with the cloth, is described with precision.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis is a high-quality caption that successfully follows all the key principles outlined in the instructions. It is a model example of how to describe motion clearly, chronologically, and objectively.",
