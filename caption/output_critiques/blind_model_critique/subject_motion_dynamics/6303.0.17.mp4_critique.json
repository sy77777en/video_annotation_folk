    "pre_caption": "The man, dressed in a red sweater and wearing a necklace, is in a room with a checkered floor and various neon lights and equipment in the background. He begins by standing with his left hand on his abdomen and his right arm extended. He then starts to raise his right arm, forming a fist. The man continues to lift his right arm higher, maintaining his fist, while his left hand remains on his abdomen. The background includes a neon sign and various electronic equipment, suggesting a lively and possibly musical environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with medium skin tone and an afro hairstyle, wearing a bright red, long-sleeved shirt. He is expressive, with his mouth open wide, possibly singing or shouting. In one instance, he raises his right arm with a clenched fist, while his left hand rests on his abdomen. The setting appears to be a room with a checkered floor and vibrant lighting, contributing to a dynamic atmosphere.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption correctly presents the man's actions in chronological order, but it includes several details that violate the core instructions. The description of the man's clothing (\"red sweater,\" \"necklace\") and the static background elements (\"checkered floor,\" \"neon lights,\" \"equipment\") should be omitted to maintain a strict focus on motion. Furthermore, the final sentence, \"suggesting a lively and possibly musical environment,\" is speculative and subjective, which is explicitly forbidden. The description of the arm movement itself is somewhat fragmented and lacks specificity. For example, instead of breaking the action into \"starts to raise\" and \"continues to lift,\" it could be described more dynamically as a single, fluid motion. Imagining the video, the man might be a DJ slowly pumping his fist to an unheard beat; a more effective caption would capture this quality, such as, \"The man, standing with his left hand on his abdomen, slowly raises his extended right arm upward, clenching his hand into a fist as it ascends.\" This revision removes prohibited details and provides a more precise and unified description of the subject's movement.",
