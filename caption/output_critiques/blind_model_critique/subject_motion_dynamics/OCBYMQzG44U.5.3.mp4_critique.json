  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. The caption's description of motion is contradictory, stating both that the perspective is \"moving down a long, narrow hallway\" and that \"The entire scene is largely static.\" The primary motion in the video is the camera's continuous forward movement, which should be the central focus. The caption also uses subjective, atmospheric language such as \"sterile,\" \"liminal aesthetic,\" and \"eerie atmosphere,\" which the instructions advise against. The description of the water's motion is good (\"slight ripples can be seen\"), but it is disconnected from the main action. To improve, the caption should describe the camera's motion more actively and chronologically, for instance, \"The camera glides forward at a steady pace through a long hallway.\" This primary action should be followed by a description of what the camera passes, integrating the secondary motion of the water, such as \"moving alongside a channel of dark water with slight ripples on its surface.\" The description should conclude by noting the camera's constant progression toward the stationary yellow rubber duck at the end of the hall, thereby providing a clear, objective, and chronologically accurate account of the video's motion.",
