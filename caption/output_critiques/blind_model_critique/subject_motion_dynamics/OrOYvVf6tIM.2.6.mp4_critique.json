    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large, open cardboard box with flaps spread outward, positioned centrally. The box is made of brown corrugated cardboard, and its interior appears dark, suggesting depth. A strong flashlight casts light onto the box's surface, highlighting its texture. The box remains stationary throughout the video, with no visible changes or additional subjects.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible video scenario. It identifies the main subject (cardboard box) and the primary source of motion (a beam of light).\n*   **Completeness:** It provides a complete, self-contained description of the entire event in the video, from the light appearing, moving across the subject, and disappearing. It also correctly notes the static nature of the box.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows this rule by describing the light's path sequentially: \"moves from the right,\" \"sweeps leftward,\" and then \"moves off-screen to the left.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly focuses on the movement of the light beam and the lack of movement of the box, which is the core dynamic of the video.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and gets straight to the point.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is free of emotional or subjective adjectives. It uses neutral, descriptive words like \"stationary,\" \"moves,\" and \"sweeps.\"\n    *   **Specificity:** It is specific without being overly detailed. Instead of just \"light moves,\" it says \"sweeps leftward across the front of the box,\" and it describes the effect of the interaction: \"illuminating different parts of the box as it travels.\"\n    *   **Certainty:** It avoids speculative language like \"it seems to\" or \"it might be.\"\n    *   **Handling of Subjects:** It correctly identifies the stationary subject (\"The cardboard box remains stationary\") and the moving element (\"A beam of light... moves\"), describing each appropriately as per the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, objective, and effectively communicates the subject's motion in a clear and chronological manner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The cardboard box stays still throughout the video. A beam of light, originating from an off-screen source, enters from the right side of the frame, moves leftward across the front of the box, and exits off-screen to the left, illuminating various parts of the box as it passes.",
