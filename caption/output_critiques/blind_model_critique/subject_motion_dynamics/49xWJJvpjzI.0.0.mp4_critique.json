    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological overview of the action, but it could be more precise in describing the specific mechanics of the movements. For instance, \"emitting a purple kinetic energy blast\" is vague; in the video, the character in the suit could be seen gathering the energy between their palms before thrusting them forward to release a wide, concussive wave, which is a more specific action than just \"emitting.\" Similarly, the bearded character's \"kicking and punching\" could be detailed further; perhaps he grabs one creature and throws it into another before delivering a powerful roundhouse kick. The description of the position switch is the weakest part; \"the two characters switch positions\" is an outcome, not an action. The video likely shows a more dynamic and coordinated maneuver, such as the suited character performing the forward side flip *over* the bearded character's head, allowing them to trade places seamlessly in a single, fluid motion. Finally, describing the battle as \"chaotic\" is a subjective summary; it would be more effective to describe the visual elements that create this feeling, such as the constant splashing of water, the sheer number of creatures swarming from all sides, and the rapid, non-stop counter-attacks from both characters.",

Nearby, a bearded character engages in combat, grabbing one creature and throwing it into another before delivering a powerful roundhouse kick. As the battle intensifies, the suited character performs a forward side flip over the bearded character's head, allowing them to trade places seamlessly in a single, fluid motion. The scene is filled with the constant splashing of water, a swarm of creatures attacking from all sides, and the rapid, non-stop counter-attacks from both characters, creating a visually dynamic and intense battle.",
