    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** A character in a black and purple suit, standing on a rock in a river, emits a purple kinetic energy blast, which throws several monstrous creatures backward through the air and into the water. Simultaneously, a bearded character fights nearby, kicking and punching other creatures, sending them flying as the chaotic battle continues.\n\n### Feedback\n\nOverall, the caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the provided instructions. It is accurate, clear, and focuses effectively on the motion.\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes two distinct sets of actions happening concurrently.\n*   It correctly identifies the cause and effect of the motions: the \"energy blast\" *throws* the creatures, and the \"kicking and punching\" *sends them flying*.\n*   The description of the environment (\"on a rock in a river\") provides necessary context for the motion (\"into the water\").\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete, capturing the primary actions of the two main subjects and their interactions with the secondary subjects (the creatures).\n*   It successfully describes the key events in the scene without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The use of \"Simultaneously\" is a perfect way to handle two actions happening at the same time, fulfilling the chronological requirement.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption excels here. It uses strong, specific action verbs like \"emits,\" \"throws,\" \"kicking,\" \"punching,\" and \"sending them flying\" instead of generic terms.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is packed into a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to understand.\n*   **No Speculation or Ambiguity:** The language is direct and factual, avoiding words like \"appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The sentence structure and vocabulary are clear and effective.\n*   **Avoids Subjective/Emotional Language:** The caption is mostly objective. While \"monstrous\" and \"chaotic\" could be seen as slightly subjective, they function here as efficient descriptors of the creature type and the overall state of the battle's motion, respectively. They are acceptable as they add clarity without being overly emotional.\n*   **Describes Interactions:** The interactions between the characters and the creatures are described with excellent clarity, specifying the cause and effect.\n*   **Avoids Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions rather than interpreting them (e.g., it doesn't say \"showcasing his immense power\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example that follows the instructions almost perfectly. It is a well-written, descriptive, and objective summary of the motion in the video.",
