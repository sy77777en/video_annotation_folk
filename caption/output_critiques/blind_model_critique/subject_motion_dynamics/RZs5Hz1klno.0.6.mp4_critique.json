    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A humanoid figure with a smooth, featureless, metallic silver face is shown facing forward. Its silver hair is neatly combed back, with individual strands visible. The figure is dressed in a dark blazer over a white V-neck shirt, with the collar of the shirt visible. The visible neck area is made of the same smooth, silver material as the face.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for a video depicting a stationary humanoid figure.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a scenario where a humanoid figure is completely motionless. It correctly identifies the subject's state (still) and orientation (facing forward).\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. For a subject with no movement, the instructions state to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption does exactly that, providing the essential information concisely.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption's entire focus is on the subject's lack of motion, as instructed.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, clear sentence that effectively conveys the video's content.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective language (\"humanoid figure remains completely still\") and speculative phrases.\n*   **Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **Chronological Order:** This rule is not applicable as there is no sequence of actions, and the caption correctly handles this by describing a continuous state.\n*   **Format:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an excellent example of how to apply the instructions to a video with a static subject. It is precise, concise, and follows all the given rules perfectly.",
