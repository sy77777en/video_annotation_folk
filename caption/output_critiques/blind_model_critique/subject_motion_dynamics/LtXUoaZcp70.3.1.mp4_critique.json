    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A translucent, blue, holographic-style figure of a man stands in a formal pose. The figure has a shimmering, particle-like texture. He is wearing what appears to be a uniform, consisting of a jacket with a high collar and a sash around his waist. His left hand is tucked into the pocket of his jacket near his hip, while his right hand is raised near his chest.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies that the man's figure does not change its physical position, it oversimplifies the visual content by stating it is 'completely stationary,' potentially missing more subtle yet significant forms of motion. For instance, the holographic figure itself could have internal movement, such as flickering, glitching, or having data streams and scan lines scrolling across its surface, which are all forms of action. The caption also fails to account for any camera movement; the camera might be slowly orbiting or panning around the stationary subject, which is a key aspect of the motion within the frame. Furthermore, the description omits any potential interactions, such as another object or a person's hand passing through the hologram, which would cause its form to ripple or distort. A more comprehensive caption would describe these dynamic visual effects in chronological order to provide a richer and more accurate account of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The holographic-style figure of a man remains in the same physical position, but exhibits subtle internal movements such as flickering, glitching, and data streams or scan lines scrolling across its surface. The camera slowly orbits around the figure, adding dynamic motion to the scene. At one point, an object or a person's hand passes through the hologram, causing its form to ripple and distort, enhancing the visual complexity of the video.",
