    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man, depicted in a blue, low-polygon style with short dark hair and wearing a suit-like attire, is seated on a white chair with his back to the viewer, facing a white desk. Across this desk sits another man, rendered in a grey, low-polygon style and wearing a simple top, who is facing the seated blue man. On the left side of the white desk rests a white microscope. Positioned on the desk, between the microscope and the seated blue man, is a white binder with a dark spine or label. An overlay in the bottom left corner displays the text \"1960\" along with a number.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption focuses excessively on the camera's movement rather than the motion of the subjects, which violates the core instruction. The phrase \"capturing the essence of a face-to-face conversation\" is an abstract interpretation, not a description of observable actions. The critique is that the caption fails to describe what the figures are actually *doing* to convey a conversation. For example, the caption could have mentioned if the grey figure gestures with its blocky hand, if the blue figure nods its head in response, or if their heads turn to face each other. A more effective description would omit the camera's path and instead detail the specific, chronological movements of the two figures, such as: \"The blue, low-polygon figure turns its head toward the grey figure, which then raises its left arm and points toward a monitor on the desk before the blue figure nods.\" This would provide a clear, objective account of the subjects' motion as instructed.",
