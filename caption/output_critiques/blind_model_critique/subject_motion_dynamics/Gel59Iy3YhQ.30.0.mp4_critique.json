    "pre_caption": "A small, cloaked figure stands in the center of a tiled arena. A large, green, frog-like monster appears at the top of the screen, raises a glowing red axe, and slams it onto the ground, shattering the tiles in front of it as the small figure dodges to the side. The monster then leaps into the air and lands in the center of the arena, creating a shockwave that breaks more tiles, while the small figure dodges away from the impact.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A massive, bipedal, frog-like monster with bloated, light green skin appears in a video game. The creature wears a red harness across its large chest and wields a large, spring-like weapon that glows with a red light. It confronts a much smaller, cloaked figure. This small figure is dressed in black, with white eyes visible, and carries a weapon that emits a purple glow.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events in a video game. It correctly identifies two subjects (a small figure and a large monster) and describes their actions and interactions precisely.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the initial state, the monster's appearance, two distinct attack phases, and the smaller figure's reactions to each attack. It provides a full, self-contained narrative of the motion in the clip.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels here. It presents the actions in a perfect sequence: the figure stands, the monster appears, raises and slams its axe, the figure dodges, the monster leaps and lands, and the figure dodges again.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption uses strong, specific action verbs instead of generic descriptions. For example, instead of \"the monster attacks,\" it says the monster \"raises a glowing red axe, and slams it onto the ground\" and \"leaps into the air and lands.\"\n    *   **Objectivity and Specificity:** It avoids emotional language (\"fearsome monster\") and speculative phrases (\"it seems to\"). The descriptions are concrete and objective (e.g., \"shattering the tiles in front of it,\" \"creating a shockwave that breaks more tiles\").\n    *   **Subject Interaction:** The interaction is described clearly through action and reaction. The monster's attacks directly cause the figure to perform a specific motion (\"dodges to the side,\" \"dodges away from the impact\").\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is easy to understand while remaining informative and detailed.\n    *   **Format:** It correctly returns only the one-paragraph description without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all stylistic and content-related rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A small, cloaked figure stands in the center of a tiled arena. Suddenly, a large, green, frog-like monster appears at the top of the screen, wielding a glowing red axe. It raises the axe high and slams it onto the ground, shattering the tiles in front of it as the small figure swiftly dodges to the side. The monster then leaps into the air and crashes down in the center of the arena, creating a shockwave that breaks more tiles, while the small figure nimbly evades the impact.",
