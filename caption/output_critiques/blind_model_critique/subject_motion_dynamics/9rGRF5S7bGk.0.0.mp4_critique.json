    "pre_caption": "The scene remains static, with no movement from the camera or any of the surrounding objects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A silver and black vintage SLR camera with a black lens is positioned centrally on a wooden surface, illuminated by a spotlight from above. Behind the camera, a red and white rectangular mini fridge with a glass door stands vertically, featuring the words \"ICE COLD\" in white lettering on a red vertical stripe, with a signature in red lettering on the white horizontal stripe. To the right of these central items are potted plants with dark green leaves in dark-colored pots, along with other indistinguishable objects due to the lack of light. Large, yellow, sans-serif capital letters spelling \"THE FILM LOOK\" are superimposed over the red and white object and positioned above the camera.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is:\nThe caption incorrectly focuses on describing the camera's technical movements and settings, such as \"rapid forward movement of the camera\" and \"shallow depth of field,\" rather than the motion of the video's subject as instructed. For instance, if the video shows a person walking and then setting down the camera that is filming, the caption should describe the person's actions, such as \"A person walks forward and then places a camera on a surface.\" The current caption is also ambiguous by stating it highlights \"the camera in the foreground,\" which is confusing—is a camera the subject of the video, or is this a meta-description of the filming process? Furthermore, the use of the subjective adjective \"peaceful\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional language. A more effective caption would identify the primary subject and chronologically describe its concrete actions, avoiding technical jargon and subjective interpretations.",
