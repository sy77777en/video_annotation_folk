    "pre_caption": "A person in a yeti costume snowboards down a steep, snow-covered mountain under a clear blue sky. Filming from a selfie stick, they lean into a turn, carving through the powder and kicking up a spray of snow behind them. Their body is angled low to the ground as they maintain balance with one arm extended to the side while moving swiftly down the slope.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person is shown wearing a full-body, white, fluffy costume resembling a yeti or an abominable snowman. The costume's head features a mask with a wide-open, snarling mouth displaying large, sharp teeth. Two curved, yellowish horns protrude from the sides of the head. The person wears large, yellow-lensed ski goggles over the mask's eye area. A black harness is strapped over the chest of the white suit, and the person is wearing white gloves. They are positioned on a snowboard, leaning into a turn with one arm extended to the side while holding a selfie stick with the other arm.**",

  "generated_critique": "The current caption provides a decent overview but lacks chronological precision and omits several key actions visible in the video. It describes a single turn, whereas the snowboarder actually executes a fluid series of S-turns down the mountain face, first carving left and then sharply right. The description of the snow spray is understated; the video clearly shows a large, arcing plume of powder being kicked up with each carve, not just a simple spray. Most importantly, the caption completely misses the climactic moment where the yeti hits a small natural ramp, becomes airborne for a brief period, and tucks their knees. The video then ends with a hard cut while the subject is still in mid-air, a detail that is crucial for accurately describing the full sequence of events.",
