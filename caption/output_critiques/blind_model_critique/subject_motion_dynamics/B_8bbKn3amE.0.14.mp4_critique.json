A serene lake lies to the left of a sharp, golden-brown ridge that dominates the foreground.\n\nThe camera appears to be flying at high speed, skimming low along the crest of the ridge. This rapid forward movement creates a dynamic, immersive perspective. The foreground blurs with the speed, emphasizing the swift flight towards the distant mountains.",

It fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the issues:\n\n*   **Use of Emotional and Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses words like \"stunning,\" \"majestic,\" and \"serene.\" The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Inclusion of Redundant Scene Description:** The entire first paragraph describes the static landscape (\"towering snow-capped peaks,\" \"serene lake,\" \"golden-brown ridge\"). The instructions direct to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Use of Speculative Language:** The caption states, \"The camera appears to be flying...\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative statements like \"it appears.\"\n*   **Use of Abstract Descriptions:** The caption includes phrases like \"creates a dynamic, immersive perspective\" and \"emphasizing the swift flight.\" This violates the rule to \"Avoid abstract descriptions.\"\n*   **Incorrect Formatting:** The caption is two paragraphs long and begins with introductory text (\"This is...\"). The instructions require a single paragraph with no introductory text.\n\nA better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\nThe camera moves forward at a high speed, flying low along the crest of a mountain ridge toward distant, snow-capped peaks.",
