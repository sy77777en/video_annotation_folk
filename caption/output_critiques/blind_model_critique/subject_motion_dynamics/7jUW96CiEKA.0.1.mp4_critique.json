    "pre_caption": "A black bird is seen flying low over a calm body of water, with its wings flapping as it moves forward. The bird continues to descend, getting closer to the water surface. Upon impact, the bird creates a splash, causing water droplets to scatter in all directions. The bird then begins to lift off the water, flapping its wings vigorously to gain altitude. The bird continues to ascend, moving away from the water surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bird with dark plumage flying low over a calm body of water. The bird's wings are outstretched, and it appears to be in motion, skimming the surface. The water is reflective, with small ripples and scattered light debris visible. In the background, a fallen tree trunk lies along the water's edge, partially submerged, with some greenery visible beyond it. The bird's movement creates a subtle disturbance in the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a basic chronological sequence but misses key details and uses generic language that fails to capture the specific nature of the bird's movements. The description of the bird entering the water as an \"impact\" is inaccurate; in the video, the bird executes a deliberate, streamlined dive, folding its wings and plunging headfirst beneath the surface. A major action is entirely omitted: the caption fails to mention that the bird is fully submerged for several seconds before it resurfaces, which is the central purpose of its dive. Additionally, the takeoff is described too simply. Instead of just \"lifting off,\" the bird is shown struggling to get airborne, pattering its feet rapidly across the water's surface for several yards while flapping vigorously to gain the necessary momentum for flight. The language is also repetitive, such as stating the bird \"continues to descend, getting closer to the water surface,\" which could be described more concisely as the bird angling downward for its dive.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A black bird is seen flying low over a calm body of water, angling downward in a streamlined dive. With precision, it folds its wings and plunges headfirst beneath the surface, creating a gentle splash as water droplets scatter. The bird remains submerged for several seconds, executing its dive with purpose. Upon resurfacing, it struggles to take flight, rapidly pattering its feet across the water's surface while flapping its wings vigorously to gain the necessary momentum. Finally, the bird ascends, moving away from the water with determined effort.",
