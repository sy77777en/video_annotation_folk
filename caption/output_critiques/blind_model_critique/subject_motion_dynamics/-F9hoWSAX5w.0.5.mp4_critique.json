  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a static scene (a building under renovation) and the camera's movement within that scene. However, its focus is incorrect based on the instructions.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption attempts to describe motion, but it focuses on the camera's motion rather than the subject's. Since the subject (the building) is static, the caption should have simply stated that, as per the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails significantly here. The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The majority of the caption is dedicated to describing the building's appearance (\"red facade,\" \"windows covered with white plastic sheets,\" \"exposed brickwork,\" \"fire escape\"), which violates this primary rule.\n*   **Handling of Static Subjects:** The instructions specify, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The caption does not do this. Instead of stating the building is stationary, it describes its appearance in detail.\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption uses the phrase \"appears to be under renovation,\" which directly violates the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** Because the caption includes many unnecessary details about the building's appearance, it is not as concise as it should be. A correct caption would be much shorter.\n\nA better caption following all instructions would be:\n\n**A stationary multi-story building is shown as the camera slowly moves closer to it.**",
