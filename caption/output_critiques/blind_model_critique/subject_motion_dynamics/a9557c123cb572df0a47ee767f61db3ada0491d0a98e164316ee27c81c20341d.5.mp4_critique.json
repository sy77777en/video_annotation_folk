    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A view of a tunnel-like structure reveals a series of nested concentric rings. The rings with a dark, metallic material and a textured diamond plate pattern, studded with small silver-colored metallic pentagons, are not the outermost ones. Closer to the center, the rings are smooth, black, and glossy. At the center of the composition is a bright, solid white circle that contrasts with the surrounding dark structure.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary motion as the forward movement of the viewpoint (\"The view moves forward\"). It also accurately describes the distinct actions of the other elements: the rings are \"rotating\" and \"concentric,\" and they \"expand outward\" as the view \"advances.\" Finally, it correctly notes the end state where the \"central white circle grows in size until it fills the entire frame.\"\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It describes the entire sequence of motion from the beginning to the end of the clip. It accounts for the movement of the perspective, the rings, and the central circle, leaving no significant motion undescribed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all the given instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a perfect chronological sequence: the view moves forward, the rings expand, and the central circle grows to fill the screen.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely focused on motion, using specific verbs like \"moves forward,\" \"rotating,\" \"advances,\" \"expand outward,\" and \"grows.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet provides a full picture of the animation's movement.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective (\"mesmerizing,\" \"dizzying\"), or speculative (\"it seems to be\") language.\n*   **Specificity:** It describes the actions with clarity. For instance, instead of \"the rings move,\" it specifies they are \"rotating\" and \"expand outward.\"\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids abstract interpretations like \"creating a sense of journey.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and objective description of the video's motion.",
