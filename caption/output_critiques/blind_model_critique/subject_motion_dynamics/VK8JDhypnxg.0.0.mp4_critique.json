    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A tall, dark gray, rectangular monolith floats vertically in the center of the scene, suspended above a body of water with small, rippling waves. The monolith appears to be composed of several stacked, geometric segments that subtly shift and reconfigure their shape. The entire scene is heavily obscured by a dense, white fog, and the image has a distorted, glitchy quality with visible scan lines and chromatic aberration.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and follows the specified format and style.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the motion in a likely video of this subject. It correctly identifies that the main object (the monolith) is stationary in its overall position (\"remains suspended,\" \"floats in place\") while its internal components are in motion (\"segments gradually shift and reconfigure\"). It also accurately describes the secondary motion of the \"small, continuous rippling waves\" in the water.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers:\n*   **The subject's overall state:** Stationary, suspended above water.\n*   **The subject's internal motion:** The specific action of the segments shifting and reconfiguring.\n*   **The subject's interaction (or lack thereof):** It explicitly and correctly notes that the monolith \"does not interact with the water.\"\n*   **The environment's motion:** It includes the movement of the water, providing full context.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows all key instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The entire description is centered on movement (or the lack of it), perfectly fulfilling this core requirement. It avoids describing the monolith's appearance (e.g., color, texture) and focuses only on its actions.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific, clear language instead of generic terms. For example, \"Its stacked geometric segments gradually shift and reconfigure\" is much better than \"parts of it are moving.\"\n*   **Chronological Order:** The motion described is continuous rather than sequential. The caption logically presents the overall static state first, then details the internal, continuous motion, which is the most effective way to describe this scene.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption uses neutral, objective language (\"suspended,\" \"vertical orientation,\" \"shift and reconfigure\") and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   **No Speculation:** It makes definitive statements (\"The monolith remains,\" \"There is no horizontal or vertical displacement\") and avoids ambiguous or speculative phrases.\n*   **Conciseness:** While it thoroughly explains the complex motion, it does so without unnecessary words. There is a slight redundancy in stating that the monolith is stationary three times (\"remains suspended...floats in place,\" \"no horizontal or vertical displacement,\" and \"does not...move from its position\"), but in this case, it serves to emphasize the unique nature of the motion (internal movement without external displacement), which is a key detail.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example of how to follow the instructions precisely. It is clear, detailed, and focuses entirely on describing the subject's motion in an objective and informative way.",
