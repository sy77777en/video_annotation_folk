    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a young woman with light brown skin, short, dark, messy hair, and large, dark eyes. She wears a white, sleeveless, pinstriped top, a blue cowl with visible stitching draped over her right shoulder, and a dark armband on her left bicep. Around her neck is a necklace with a teardrop-shaped pendant that emits a bright blue glow, appearing segmented due to its attachment to the string. She holds a gnarled, dark wooden staff in her right hand, the top of which also glows blue. Her expression is serious and focused as she looks slightly upward.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is that the caption is too general and misses key details about the interaction with the staff and the nature of the subject's gaze. The phrase \"stays mostly still\" is a weak opening and could be replaced by describing her initial action, which is standing still while looking forward. The description \"raises her right arm to lift the wooden staff\" is vague; it doesn't specify that she grips the staff, which is resting on the ground, and lifts it to a vertical position in front of her. A more informative description would clarify the starting and ending position of the object. Furthermore, \"her eyes move around\" is imprecise. In the video, she turns her head to the right, and then her eyes deliberately scan the area from right to left, suggesting a specific action like surveying her surroundings, which is a more descriptive detail than simply moving. The caption should specify this scanning motion to accurately portray the action.",
