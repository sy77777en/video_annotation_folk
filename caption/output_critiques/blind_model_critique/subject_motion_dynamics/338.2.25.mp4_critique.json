    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man as the main subject, seated at a table in a restaurant. He has short dark hair and is wearing a beige short-sleeved shirt. He is engaged in an unusual action, using a portable electric fan attached to chopsticks to cool the noodles while eating with chopsticks. His expression is focused on the task. To his left, another man with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a yellow shirt, watches with a shocked expression. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art. The main focus is on the man's unique method of eating, with the surrounding people providing context and reactions.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption based on the instructions:\n\nThe caption is moderately effective but fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Good:** The caption accurately identifies the main subject (man in a beige shirt), the unique object he is using (a blue portable fan attached to chopsticks), and his primary action (cooling his noodles). It also correctly identifies a secondary subject (man in a yellow shirt).\n*   **Inaccurate:** The phrase \"watches in amazement\" is a major error. \"Amazement\" is a subjective interpretation of the man's emotional state, which cannot be known for certain. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" A more accurate description would be to simply state that the man watches.\n*   **Ambiguous:** The final clause, \"as he continues to eat with the fan,\" is unclear. It's ambiguous whether the man in beige is eating *with* the fan-chopstick contraption or if he is simply continuing the process of cooling and then eating. This phrasing could be more precise.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Good:** The caption captures the central and most notable action in the video. It provides enough context to understand what is happening.\n*   **Could be improved:** The description of the motion could be more detailed and chronological. For instance, it could describe if the man lifts the noodles toward his mouth while the fan is on, then eats them. The current phrasing \"cool his noodles before eating\" followed by \"continues to eat\" is slightly confusing.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Object Interaction:** The caption excels at describing the subject's interaction with an object, clearly stating he \"uses a blue portable fan attached to chopsticks to cool his noodles.\"\n    *   **Subject Differentiation:** It correctly uses appearance (\"beige shirt,\" \"yellow shirt\") to differentiate between the two main subjects.\n    *   **Avoids Abstraction:** It avoids abstract descriptions and focuses on the concrete action.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violates \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** As mentioned, using \"in amazement\" is a direct violation of the rules.\n    *   **Lacks Chronological Clarity:** The sequence of actions isn't presented as clearly as it could be (e.g., \"cools noodles before eating\" vs. \"continues to eat\").\n    *   **Unnecessary Detail:** The description of the setting (\"ornate wall decorations\") is not essential to the subject's motion and could be omitted to make the caption more concise, as per the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details.\"",
