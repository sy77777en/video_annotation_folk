    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person on an ascending escalator, viewed from behind. The person, whose upper body is visible from above the chest, occupies half the height of the frame. They have shoulder-length, light-colored hair and are wearing a dark jacket. The camera captures the person centrally, emphasizing their presence while also showing the surrounding escalator and tiled walls. The setting suggests an indoor environment, likely a subway or shopping center, with fluorescent lighting reflecting off the surfaces.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject and the primary action of ascending an escalator, but its description of the motion is too passive and potentially incomplete. Stating the woman \"remains stationary\" is technically true relative to her step but fails to capture the main visual dynamic of the video, which is her continuous upward movement as the central point of a moving frame. A more effective description would focus on this upward trajectory. Furthermore, the claim of \"no significant changes in her posture\" is a strong and likely inaccurate assertion; in the video, she could subtly shift her weight, her hair might sway from the movement, or she might turn her head slightly to glance at the top of the escalator as she approaches it. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the relative motion of the environment, such as the white tiled walls and overhead lights scrolling steadily downward past the camera. Finally, the description lacks a conclusion. A complete chronological account would include the final action, such as the woman lifting her foot to step off the escalator onto the landing and then walking out of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with shoulder-length, light-colored hair is seen from behind as she ascends an escalator, her upward movement creating a dynamic visual focus. The escalator is enclosed by white tiled walls, which, along with the metallic handrail on the left side, scroll steadily downward past the camera. Bright overhead lights cast reflections on the walls, enhancing the sense of motion. As she rises, the woman subtly shifts her weight, her hair swaying slightly, and she may turn her head to glance at the top of the escalator. The sequence concludes with her lifting her foot to step off the escalator onto the landing, before walking out of the frame.",
