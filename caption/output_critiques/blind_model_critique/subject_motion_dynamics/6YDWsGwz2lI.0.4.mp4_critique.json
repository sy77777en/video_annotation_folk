    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person on an ascending escalator, viewed from behind. The person, whose upper body is visible from above the chest, occupies half the height of the frame. They have shoulder-length, light-colored hair and are wearing a dark jacket. The camera captures the person centrally, emphasizing their presence while also showing the surrounding escalator and tiled walls. The setting suggests an indoor environment, likely a subway or shopping center, with fluorescent lighting reflecting off the surfaces.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to follow several core instructions, primarily by focusing on static descriptions of the subject and environment rather than the motion itself.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is factually accurate in its description of the woman, the escalator, and the surrounding environment.\n*   However, the description of motion is slightly misleading. While the woman \"remains stationary\" relative to the escalator step, the primary motion of the subject in the video is being carried upward. Stating she \"ascends\" and then \"remains stationary\" is contradictory and doesn't clearly describe the overall action.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is overly complete in describing static details (hair, walls, handrail, lighting), which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   It is incomplete in its primary task: providing a concise and focused description of the subject's motion. The motion of being carried upward is mentioned but not made the central point of the description.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Failure to Focus on Motion:** The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption violates this rule by dedicating the majority of its text to the woman's hair and the escalator's environment.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** The instructions ask for a \"concise yet informative description.\" By including extensive details about appearance and setting, the caption becomes bloated and loses its focus. The first three sentences are almost entirely unnecessary.\n*   **Incorrect Handling of \"No Movement\":** The instruction for static subjects is for when there is *no movement at all*. In this video, the subject is clearly in motion as she is transported upward by the escalator. The caption should have described this passive motion instead of focusing on her static posture.\n\nA much better caption that adheres to all instructions would be:\n\n**A woman, seen from behind, is carried upward on an escalator.**",
