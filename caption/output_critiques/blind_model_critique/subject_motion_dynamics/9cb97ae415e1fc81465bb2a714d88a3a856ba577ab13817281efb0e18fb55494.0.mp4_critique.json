    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully follows all the guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible street scene. It clearly states the direction of movement for both the primary subjects (pedestrians crossing from right to left) and the background subjects (cars driving from left to right), which is a key detail for accuracy.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive without being overly detailed. It captures:\n*   **Group Action:** \"Several pedestrians cross a street.\"\n*   **Specific Individual Action:** \"A person in light-colored pants briefly skips while walking.\"\n*   **Secondary Subject Actions:** \"an adult and a child also walk across the street\" and \"cars drive from left to right.\"\nIt successfully paints a full picture of the motion within the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels at following the specific rules:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It uses clear, descriptive action verbs like \"cross,\" \"skips,\" \"walking,\" and \"drive.\"\n*   **Specificity:** Instead of just saying \"people walk,\" it highlights a unique movement (\"briefly skips\") which makes the description more informative and specific, as requested.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions described are concurrent, and the caption presents them logically without forcing a false sequence.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all emotional, subjective (\"happily skips\"), or speculative (\"appears to be skipping\") language.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is a single, coherent unit written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Subject Differentiation:** It correctly uses appearance details (\"light-colored pants,\" \"dark jacket\") only to differentiate the specific people involved in the skipping action, which is exactly what the instructions mandate.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The language is concrete and factual, avoiding abstract interpretations like \"moving with a youthful energy.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is precise, objective, and focuses entirely on describing the motion in a clear and informative way.",
