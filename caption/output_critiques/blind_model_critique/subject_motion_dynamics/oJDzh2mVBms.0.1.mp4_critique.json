  "generated_critique": "This caption accurately identifies the subjects but fails to describe their motion, which is the central element of the video. It describes a static photograph rather than a video by not mentioning how the northern lights move. For example, it omits that the green aurora begins as a faint band on the horizon before intensifying and rippling upwards into vertical curtains of light that drift across the sky. The caption also includes subjective and emotional adjectives like 'striking,' 'tranquil,' and 'atmospheric,' which should be avoided. An improved caption would focus exclusively on the specific, chronological movements of the aurora, detailing how its shape and intensity change over the stationary snowy landscape, rather than describing the overall mood of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows the northern lights (aurora borealis) beginning as a faint green band on the horizon, gradually intensifying and rippling upwards into vertical curtains of light. These curtains drift across the dark, starry sky above a snowy landscape with a small building and trees, highlighting the dynamic movement of the aurora against the stationary backdrop.",
