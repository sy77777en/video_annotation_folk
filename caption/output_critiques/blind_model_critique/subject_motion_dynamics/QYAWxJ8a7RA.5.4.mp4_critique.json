    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a clear view of a warning sign that reads 'ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA' with a red triangle containing an exclamation mark, indicating danger. The sign advises avoiding dusty situations and keeping children away from the tailings, as inhaling asbestos fibers may cause cancer. The background shows a rocky, arid landscape with some green shrubs and a clear blue sky. As the camera moves forward, the sign remains the central focus, and the surrounding environment becomes more detailed, revealing more of the rocky terrain and sparse vegetation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video prominently features a warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle containing an exclamation mark, indicating danger. The sign warns about the risks of inhaling asbestos fibers, which may cause cancer, and advises avoiding dusty situations and keeping children away from the tailings. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and is positioned in a natural setting with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The landscape includes reddish-brown rock formations and some green shrubs, suggesting a dry, possibly desert-like environment. The sign is the central focus, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the visual content in the video (a warning sign, a landscape, and camera movement).\n\n**Completeness:**\nWhile it describes both the static elements and the motion, it is incomplete in fulfilling the core task, which is to focus on motion.\n\n**Adherence to the given instruction:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Incorrect Focus:** The primary instruction is to \"Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion.\" The caption does the opposite, focusing almost entirely on the static warning sign, transcribing its text in detail, and describing the stationary background. The actual motion (\"the camera moves forward\") is treated as a minor detail at the end.\n*   **Violation of \"No Repetition\" Rule:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" Transcribing the sign's text is a clear violation of this, as this information is a static detail, not motion.\n*   **Mishandling of a Static Subject:** The main subject, the sign, is stationary. The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that.\" The caption should have noted the sign is static and then described the only motion present—the camera's movement. Instead, it provides an exhaustive description of the static sign.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** By including a lengthy transcription of the sign, the caption is not concise and is filled with information irrelevant to the core task of describing motion.\n\nIn summary, the caption is poor because it fundamentally misunderstands the prompt's objective, prioritizing the description of static objects and text over the description of motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera moves steadily forward, keeping the stationary warning sign in focus against a backdrop of rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. As the camera advances, more details of the arid landscape and green shrubs are revealed, while the sign remains a central, unmoving element in the scene.",
