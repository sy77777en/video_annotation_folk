    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person with a light skin tone and short, slightly wavy reddish-brown hair. They are wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, holding a black book or folder under their arm. They stand facing a glass door. Their posture is upright, and they appear to be focused on the door.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's assertion that the person \"remains still\" is likely an oversimplification, as it fails to account for subtle, natural movements like breathing, blinking, or a slight shift in posture that would be visible in a video. A more significant omission is the lack of any description of motion in the environment, which is highly probable given the setting; for instance, the glass door could show reflections of passing cars or the movement of people walking by in the background, both of which are key visual elements that have been ignored. The caption also violates the instructions by using the ambiguous phrase \"book or folder\" instead of committing to a specific description. Finally, the description completely neglects to mention any potential camera movement; if the camera were slowly zooming in on the subject's face or panning across the scene, this would be the primary motion in the video, and its absence from the caption is a critical flaw.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person stands in front of a glass door, holding a black book under their arm, and gazes at their reflection in the glass. Subtle movements, such as breathing and blinking, are visible as they maintain their focus. Reflections of passing cars and people walking by animate the background, adding dynamic elements to the scene. The camera slowly zooms in on the person's face, enhancing the introspective mood of the video.",
