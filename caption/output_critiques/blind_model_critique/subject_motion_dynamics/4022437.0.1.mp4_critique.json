    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases a Mercedes S550, viewed from the rear left corner. The camera begins with a wide shot of the entire car before move forwards to focus in on the left rear wheel. In this close-up, the Mercedes and AMG badges are clearly visible, along with the Continental branding on the tire. The car's sleek black exterior contrasts with its tan leather interior, and its large, silver alloy wheels feature a five-spoke pattern. A few buildings can be seen in the background, adding context to the setting.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption correctly notes that the car is stationary, but it is repetitive by stating this twice (\"remains stationary\" and \"does not move\"). The description of the camera work, \"moves forward to focus on,\" is also too generic. In the video I watched, the camera performs a slow, smooth dolly-in, gliding from the initial wide shot of the car's rear three-quarters to a tight, detailed close-up that highlights the texture of the tire and the polished finish of the alloy wheel. Furthermore, the caption misses subtle but significant details: the car's LED taillights are illuminated and pulse softly throughout the shot, and the reflections of clouds can be seen drifting across the car's glossy black paint and windows. A more effective description would concisely state the car is stationary once and then focus on the specific camera movement and these other minor visual activities to better convey the video's content.",
