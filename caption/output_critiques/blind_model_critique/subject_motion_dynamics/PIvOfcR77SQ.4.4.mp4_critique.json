    "pre_caption": "The video shows a person riding a sled on a snow-covered path, with the camera positioned to capture the view from their perspective. The sled has a steering wheel and a ski-like front, and the rider's legs are visible, indicating they are seated on the sled. The path is surrounded by snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees, creating a wintery forest environment. The rider's hand is seen gripping the steering wheel, and the sled moves smoothly along the track, leaving visible tracks in the snow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures a snowy landscape from a first-person point of view, showing a person riding a sled with a steering wheel and a ski-like front. The casual forward-facing perspective occasionally reveals the rider's legs. The snow-covered path is surrounded by snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees, conveying a sense of movement along a snowy track with the sled's tracks visible in the snow.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Primary Failure: Lack of Focus on Motion:** The core instruction is to \"Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion.\" This caption dedicates the majority of its text to describing the scenery (\"snowbanks and lined with tall evergreen trees\"), the subject's appearance (\"sled has a steering wheel and a ski-like front,\" \"rider's legs are visible\"), and the camera perspective. The actual motion is only briefly mentioned with the generic phrase \"moves smoothly along the track.\"\n\n*   **Violation of Appearance Rule:** The instructions explicitly state, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption violates this by describing the sled's steering wheel, its front, and the rider's legs.\n\n*   **Not Concise:** Because the caption includes extensive details about the environment and the sled's features, it is not concise. It is filled with information that the instructions direct to be omitted.\n\n*   **Generic Action Description:** The phrase \"moves smoothly\" is a generic description. The instructions ask for specificity, such as \"a runner sprints across the finish line.\" A better caption would describe *how* the sled moves, such as gliding, turning, or changing speed.\n\n*   **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows a person...\", which is an introductory phrase that should be avoided according to the instructions. The description should begin directly with the action.",
