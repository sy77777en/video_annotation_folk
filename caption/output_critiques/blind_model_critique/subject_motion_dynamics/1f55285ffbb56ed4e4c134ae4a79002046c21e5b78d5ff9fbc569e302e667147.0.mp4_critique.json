  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as ocean waves and accurately describes their fundamental motion: crashing onto a beach, creating foam, rolling in, receding, and advancing.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption captures the essential, continuous motion of the waves. It successfully describes the cyclical pattern of the water's movement. It is complete in its description of the primary action in the video.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption adheres to some instructions but violates a key one.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It primarily describes the motion of the waves using specific verbs like \"crashing,\" \"roll in and out,\" \"recede,\" and \"advance.\"\n*   **Chronological/Cyclical Order:** It correctly describes the repeating cycle of the waves' movement.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and presented in a single paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n\n**Where it fails to adhere:**\n*   **Describes Appearance, Not Motion:** The sentence, \"The water is a clear blue-green, and the sand is a light brown color,\" is a direct violation of the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" Describing color is a static detail of appearance, not motion.\n*   **Introductory Text:** The phrase \"The video shows...\" is introductory and could be omitted for a more direct description, as implied by the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"",
