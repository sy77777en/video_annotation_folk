    "pre_caption": "A small green ball held by a gray-blue cat disappears from view as a small, red cat materializes in a burst of red petals. The red cat lands on a white cloud that appears beneath him, and the cloud hovers in the air. While holding a trident, the red cat gestures with his arms and points at the larger, gray-blue cat, who remains mostly stationary while his head turns slightly and his facial expression changes.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A gray-blue cartoon cat with a white muzzle, a light gray chest patch, and pink inner ears is shown from the upper body up. Initially, he has an angry expression and holds a small green ball in his white left hand. The ball then disappears from view as a small, red cartoon cat, depicted as a devil with horns and a pointed tail, appears. This red cat, who has a white muzzle, stands on a small white cloud and holds a red trident. The gray-blue cat's expression shifts to one of surprise and concern as he looks at the smaller, red cat. The red cat is shown in his entirety, gesturing towards the larger cat.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It uses objective language to describe the subjects (\"small, red cat,\" \"larger, gray-blue cat\") and objects (\"green ball,\" \"trident,\" \"white cloud\"). The actions described are concrete and observable.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a comprehensive, end-to-end description of the events in the video. It starts with the initial action (the ball disappearing), covers the main transformation and subsequent actions of the red cat, and concludes by describing the reaction of the gray-blue cat. It successfully captures all the key motion details in a single, coherent narrative.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given instructions meticulously:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, sequential order: the ball disappears, the red cat materializes, lands on a cloud, the cloud hovers, the red cat gestures, and the gray-blue cat reacts.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on motion and action. It uses strong, specific verbs like \"disappears,\" \"materializes,\" \"lands,\" \"hovers,\" \"gestures,\" \"points,\" and \"turns.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is dense with information but remains clear and to the point. It avoids unnecessary words while including all essential details.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is free of emotional or subjective adjectives (\"angry,\" \"magical\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears,\" \"might be\").\n*   **Specificity:** It excels at being specific. For example, instead of \"a cat appears,\" it says \"a small, red cat materializes in a burst of red petals.\" Instead of \"the cats interact,\" it says the red cat \"points at the larger, gray-blue cat.\"\n*   **Subject Interaction:** The interaction is clearly defined (\"points at the larger, gray-blue cat\").\n*   **Object Interaction:** Interactions with objects are specified (\"held by a gray-blue cat,\" \"lands on a white cloud,\" \"holding a trident\").\n*   **Focus on Main Subject:** The primary focus is on the red cat's dynamic movements, while the gray-blue cat's more subtle motion is described concisely, as instructed.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, clean paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is descriptive, precise, and well-structured.",
