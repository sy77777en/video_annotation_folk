    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the scene. It correctly identifies the subjects (\"a group of people\") and their state of motion (\"sits stationary\"). It also provides a correct, brief description of the environment (\"sunlit, wooded hillside\").\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete according to the instructions. For a video with no movement, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The caption \"sits stationary\" perfectly fulfills this requirement by directly addressing the lack of motion.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption's primary focus is on the subjects' lack of motion (\"sits stationary\"), which is the most important detail as per the instructions.\n    *   **Conciseness:** It is a single, concise sentence that conveys all necessary information without being wordy.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It uses simple, objective language (\"sits stationary,\" \"sunlit,\" \"wooded\") and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative words.\n    *   **Chronological Order:** This rule is not applicable as there is no sequence of actions, and the caption correctly handles this by describing a static state.\n    *   **Clarity:** The language is simple and natural, making the description easy to understand.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of how to apply the instructions to a video where the subjects are static. It is precise, concise, and follows all the given rules.",
