    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A red sedan is shown in a digitally manipulated scene where the ocean curves upward around a right-angled highway. The camera smoothly tracks the red car from above and behind, starting from an almost bird’s-eye view and moving downward and forward. Overlaid at the bottom of the scene is white text that reads \"CHARGES WHEN YOU PLUG-IN\" in a blocky, digital-style font with a slight glitch effect. To the right of the text is a white outline of a charging plug with a segment of wire.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the primary subject and setting, but its focus shifts too heavily onto the camera's movement and subjective interpretations rather than the subject's specific actions. Phrases like \"intriguingly curves,\" \"captivating visual effect,\" and \"enhance the dynamic perspective\" are abstract and emotional, violating the instruction to use objective language. The description of the car's motion, \"drives steadily,\" is too generic. A more effective caption would provide concrete details about the car's movement in relation to the unique environment. For example, it could specify that the car maintains a constant velocity without any apparent effort as it transitions from the flat surface of the highway to begin its ascent up the impossibly steep, upward curve. The description of the camera's motion should be secondary and serve to contextualize the car's movement, rather than being presented as a primary action.",
