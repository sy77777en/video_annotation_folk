    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with light skin and a beard is shown from a low-angle perspective in a snowy, wooded area. He is dressed in winter sports attire, consisting of a black helmet, black ski goggles, a black jacket with white sleeves, and black pants. He wears black gloves and has a pink and white pass with black lettering clipped to his jacket. The man is in a low, athletic stance, holding a ski pole with a red strap in one hand.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the low-angle perspective and the man's crouched posture as he moves through the trees, it lacks specificity regarding the nature of his motion. The term \"glides\" is too general; the description would be significantly improved by specifying the equipment used, such as stating that the man carves through the snow on a snowboard or propels himself forward on cross-country skis. Furthermore, the caption misses an opportunity to describe the man's interaction with his environment. For instance, if he is snowboarding, a more detailed description could mention how his board displaces the snow, sending a plume of powder into the air as he executes a turn. The description of him \"turning his head and upper body\" could also be more precise by connecting it to the action, such as \"he turns his head to scan the path ahead while rotating his shoulders to steer between the trees.\" Adding these specific details about the method of movement and its effect on the surroundings would provide a much clearer and more informative picture of the action in the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low-angle perspective, a man carves through the snowy forest on a snowboard. He maintains a low, athletic crouch as he expertly navigates between the bare trees, sending a plume of powder into the air with each turn. He turns his head to scan the path ahead while rotating his shoulders to steer smoothly between the trees, creating a dynamic interaction with his wintry surroundings.",
