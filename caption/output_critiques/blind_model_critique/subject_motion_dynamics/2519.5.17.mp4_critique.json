    "pre_caption": "The video shows an older man and a young boy in a close interaction. The man, wearing a dark green sweater over a collared shirt, is seen speaking or listening intently. He then raises his hand to his mouth, appearing to be in thought or contemplation, and then lowers his hand. The background is a plain, dimly lit room, suggesting an intimate or private setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features an older man and a young boy engaged in a close interaction. The man, with gray hair and a weathered face, wears a dark green sweater over a collared shirt. He appears to be speaking or listening intently, with a focused expression. The boy, with short dark hair, is seen from the back and side. The interaction suggests a moment of communication or connection between them, with the man leaning slightly towards the boy, indicating attentiveness or concern.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is partially accurate. It correctly identifies an older man and a young boy as the subjects and accurately describes the man's motion of raising and lowering his hand to his mouth. However, it inaccurately presents internal states or interpretations as observable actions. For example, \"listening intently\" and being \"in thought or contemplation\" are interpretations of the man's mental state, not direct descriptions of his physical motion.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete as it focuses heavily on interpreting the man's actions rather than just describing them. It also includes details about the background (\"plain, dimly lit room\") and the man's clothing (\"dark green sweater\"), which are not related to motion and are discouraged by the instructions. The motion of the young boy is not described at all, leaving out a key subject's actions.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** The caption violates this rule with phrases like \"**appearing to be** in thought or contemplation\" and \"**suggesting** an intimate or private setting.\" The instructions explicitly forbid speculative language.\n*   **Avoid Ambiguous Options:** The phrase \"**speaking or listening**\" is an ambiguous option (\"A or B\"), which the instructions prohibit.\n*   **Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The word \"**intently**\" is a subjective adverb that describes the quality of an action rather than the action itself.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption dedicates significant space to non-motion details, such as the man's clothing and the interpretation of the background, instead of focusing purely on the subjects' movements.\n*   **Describe Actions, Not Internal States:** Describing the man as \"listening\" or \"in thought\" is a description of a potential internal state, not a visible, physical action as required by the instructions.",
