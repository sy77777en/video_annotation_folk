    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a small, blue and white kite flying in the pale sky. The camera then tilts downward and pans to the left, focusing on a young girl seen from the back. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a white and black horizontally striped sleeveless dress and purple and green sandals. The girl is holding a blue plastic spool with a white string attached, which is connected to an object in the sky that is not visible within the frame. She is first observed walking away from the camera, then she stops and raises her arms above her head, as if controlling the kite.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption appears to be accurate in its description of the events: a kite is flying, and then a girl is seen walking and raising a spool of string. All described actions are plausible and presented as factual observations.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete, covering the key actions of both the kite and the girl in chronological order. It successfully describes the girl's interaction with the spool. However, the description of the kite's motion (\"flies\") is generic. If the video showed a more specific movement (e.g., \"drifts,\" \"hovers,\" \"dips and sways\"), adding that detail would improve the caption's adherence to the instruction to \"specify how they move.\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly presents the sequence of events: the kite is shown first, followed by the girl's actions.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The description is clear, concise, and uses simple English.\n    *   **Specificity:** The description of the girl's motion is very good (\"walks a few steps forward,\" \"stops,\" \"raises a blue spool of string above her head with both hands\").\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The main weakness is how it describes the transition between subjects. The instruction is to \"focus on the subject's motion\" and, if a shot transition occurs, to note it. The caption says, \"**The camera then focuses on** a young girl...\" This describes a cinematographic choice rather than the subject's action or a simple scene change. A more compliant phrasing would be: \"A small kite flies in the sky. **The scene then cuts to** a young girl from behind as she walks...\" This phrasing notes the transition and immediately returns the focus to the subject's motion, as required by the instructions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **good** but not perfect. It excels in its chronological structure, objectivity, and specific description of the girl's actions. However, it deviates from the instructions by describing a camera movement instead of focusing purely on the subject's motion and noting the shot transition.",
