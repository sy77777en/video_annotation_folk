    "pre_caption": "A person is walking while holding a book titled 'Virgil's Chronicle' with a maroon cover and gold lettering. The person is wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and a dark striped tie. In the background, a yellow car is parked on the street, and a house with a blue exterior and a well-maintained hedge is visible. The person continues to walk, maintaining a steady pace, with the book held securely in their right hand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person with light skin, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and a dark striped tie, holding a book titled \"Virgil's Chronicle\" with a maroon cover and gold lettering. The person is walking, holding the book close to their chest. In the background, a yellow car is visible, providing context to the setting. The focus is primarily on the person and the book, highlighting their attire and the book's distinct appearance.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good inventory of the static elements in the scene but fails to adequately describe the subject's motion as instructed. The description of the person \"walking\" and \"maintaining a steady pace\" is too generic and misses the specific dynamics I observed in the video. For instance, the video shows the person walking from the right side of the frame towards the left, and they are not just holding the book but actually flip it open with their left thumb while walking, glance down at a page for a moment, and then snap it shut before continuing on their path. The caption completely omits this key chronological sequence of actions—the interaction with the book is the most significant motion detail beyond the simple act of walking. Furthermore, focusing on the book's title, the car's color, and the house's exterior is a description of static scenery rather than the subject's movement, which goes against the instruction to prioritize motion over details that might already be listed elsewhere. A better caption would chronologically detail the person's path across the screen and their specific interaction with the book.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The person enters the frame from the right, walking towards the left while holding a book with a maroon cover and gold lettering. As they move, they flip the book open with their left thumb, glance down at a page briefly, and then snap it shut before continuing their path. The person is wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and a dark striped tie, maintaining a steady pace throughout the sequence.",
