    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is shown from a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night vision scope. The viewer is holding a black assault rifle with a red dot sight. A man with a beard, wearing a head covering and a tactical vest, enters the room with a flashlight in his left hand raised, while his right hand is positioned at his waist holding a gun. On-screen text includes subtitles at the bottom and a heads-up display with a checkpoint notification and an ammunition counter.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the events in the video. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the initial reveal of the man, his starting posture (hands raised), and his subsequent action (lowering his hands).\n*   **Completeness:** It captures all the essential motion within the video. It describes the initial camera movement (\"the view peeks out\") and the primary action of the subject (\"abruptly lowers his hands\"), providing a full, yet concise, summary.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence: the view peeks out, revealing the man, who then lowers his hands.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption focuses on the key movements (\"peeks out,\" \"lowers his hands\") rather than just the subject's appearance.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, direct, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. The word \"abruptly\" is an effective and objective descriptor of the speed and manner of the motion.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The description is based entirely on what is visible, with no speculative phrases like \"it seems\" or \"he might be.\"\n    *   **Specificity:** It clearly describes the specific actions (\"peeks out from behind a door frame,\" \"lowers his hands\") instead of using generic terms.",
