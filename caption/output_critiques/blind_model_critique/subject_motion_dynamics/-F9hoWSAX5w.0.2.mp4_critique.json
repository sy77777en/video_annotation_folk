    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**The caption is good but not perfect. It follows most instructions well but has one key area for improvement.**\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate. It describes a sequence of events in a logical and believable order: a man walks, and then two other people appear and follow him. It identifies specific, concrete details like the umbrella, McDonald's, and 'Miller's Pub', suggesting it is a faithful description of the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in its description of the motion. It accounts for the primary subject (the man with the umbrella) and the secondary subjects (the two individuals who follow). It also correctly notes how the secondary subjects enter the scene (\"appear from the left side of the frame\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, chronological sequence: the man walks, then others appear and follow.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It describes the actions of \"walks forward,\" \"passing by,\" and \"follow him.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective words. \"Dimly lit\" and \"wet\" are factual descriptions of the environment.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction between the subjects (\"two other individuals... follow him\").\n*   **Subject Reveal:** It adheres to the instruction to describe how subjects appear (\"appear from the left side of the frame\").\n\n**Where the caption can be improved:**\n*   **Over-emphasis on Scenery:** The main weakness is the inclusion of excessive environmental details, which violates the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" The final sentence, \"The street is lined with buildings, and the scene is illuminated by streetlights and the glow from the pub's sign,\" is entirely dedicated to the static background. While some context is helpful (like \"on a dimly lit, wet street\"), this level of detail on the setting detracts from the primary focus on movement. The instruction prioritizes motion above all else.",
