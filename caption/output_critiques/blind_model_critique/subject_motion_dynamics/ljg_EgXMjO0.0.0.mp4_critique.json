    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A hand-drawn, black-and-white animation depicts the rapid growth of an abstract, plant-like organism. Initially, a small, four-lobed shape with rounded corners appears in the center of a white expanse. This shape quickly expands and multiplies, sprouting into an intricate and dense pattern of organic forms. The final composition features twisting, vine-like lines, stylized leaves, small, round, fruit-like spheres, and scattered star-shaped figures, all rendered in a sketchy, black-ink style.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the chronological sequence of the animation from a central shape to a full-frame pattern, it could be more specific about the nature of the motion. The initial \"subtly shifts\" is vague; a more descriptive term like \"vibrates in place\" or \"briefly trembles\" would better capture the small, energetic movement before the main expansion. Furthermore, the description of the growth phase—\"New lines and organic forms sprout and multiply\"—could be more dynamic. The video likely shows these lines not just appearing, but actively curling and branching as they extend from the center. The caption describes the final components (\"twisting vines, leaves, and star-like figures\") as a static result, but it would be more informative to describe their formation during the growth process, for example, by noting that the extending lines unfurl into vines, which then sprout leaves at their tips or converge to form the star-like figures. This would better convey the fluid, developmental quality of the animation as it builds the final intricate design.",
