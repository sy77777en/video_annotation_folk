    "pre_caption": "A woman with light-colored hair, wearing a black coat, walks away from the camera down a city street. The street is flanked by tall buildings on both sides, and there are streetlights with warm lights illuminating the area. A few cars are seen on the road, and some bicycles are parked along the sidewalk. The camera gradually moves closer to the woman as she continues walking, capturing the urban landscape and the movement of the city around her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a wide shot of a city street, focusing on a woman walking away from the camera. She is seen from behind, with only her upper body visible. The woman has light-colored hair and is wearing a black coat. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the scene captures the urban environment with its architecture and streetlights. The camera follows her as she walks, maintaining her as the central subject while providing context of the bustling city around her.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**1. Lack of Focus on Motion:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** The caption dedicates a significant portion to describing the static environment (\"The street is flanked by tall buildings on both sides,\" \"streetlights with warm lights,\" \"bicycles are parked along the sidewalk\"). This information is about the scene, not the motion within it.\n\n**2. Unnecessary Description of Appearance:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance.\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** The caption begins by describing the subject as \"A woman with light-colored hair, wearing a black coat.\" Since she is the only main subject, these details are unnecessary and violate the instruction.\n\n**3. Use of Abstract Descriptions:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Avoid abstract descriptions, such as 'emphasizing its speed and agility.'\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** The final phrase, \"capturing the urban landscape and the movement of the city around her,\" is an abstract interpretation of the shot's purpose. It describes the effect of the cinematography rather than the literal, observable motion of the subjects.\n\n**4. Vague Description of Secondary Motion:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Describe individual subject actions with clarity... If there are multiple subjects... describe their motion collectively and concisely.\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** The caption states, \"A few cars are seen on the road,\" which is vague. It does not specify if the cars are moving, in which direction they are traveling relative to the woman, or if they are parked.\n\n**In summary:** The caption is more of a general scene description than a concise, motion-focused summary as required by the instructions. It includes superfluous details about the subject's appearance and the static environment while being too vague about the motion of secondary subjects and using abstract language.\n\nA better caption following the instructions would be:\n\n**A woman walks away from the camera down a city street as cars drive past. The camera slowly moves forward, following the woman.**",
