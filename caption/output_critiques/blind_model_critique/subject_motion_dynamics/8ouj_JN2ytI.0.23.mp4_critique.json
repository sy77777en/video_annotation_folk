    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a football player, a man with a dark skin tone, running across a green field while holding a brown football. He wears a yellow jersey with black shoulders and the white number \"86\" on the front, along with black pants that have a white stripe down the side and a black helmet. On the ground, another player in a similar yellow and black uniform is tangled with an opposing player in a light blue and white uniform. Other players from both teams are visible in the background, also running on the field. A large crowd of spectators, many wearing yellow, can be seen in the stands.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and the general direction of movement in chronological order. However, it could be more specific about the nature of the actions. For instance, \"runs with the ball\" is generic; the video likely shows the player actively \"dribbling the ball with his feet\" as he sprints. The description of the tackle is also somewhat passive and disconnected from the main action. Instead of stating he \"passes a teammate on the ground,\" the caption could better integrate this by describing the immediate aftermath, such as \"he runs past a teammate and an opponent who are both on the turf following a recent slide tackle.\" This would more accurately capture the dynamic and continuous flow of the play. Furthermore, the description of the background players is vague; the video probably shows some opponents \"sprinting to converge on the ball carrier\" while his own teammates \"run into open space to offer a passing option,\" details that would add significant context to the play.",
