    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A light-skinned man, who appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s, stands in the middle of a living room. He has short, dark hair and a short beard. He is wearing a blue, long-sleeved shirt with dark sleeves and dark-colored pants. Throughout the video, he holds an open, medium-sized cardboard box in front of him with both hands, looking around the room with a serious expression.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video's content as described by the caption, here is the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes the subject (a man), his interaction with an object (holding a box), and the specific, limited motion he performs (turning his head). It also correctly notes the lack of other movements (body and feet are stationary).\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It covers all the described actions in the video from start to finish, presenting them in a clear sequence. It successfully captures the essence of a video with minimal movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption is excellent and follows all instructions perfectly.\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly sequences the head movement: \"turns his head slightly to the left and then back to the center.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely focused on the man's physical actions, not his appearance or surroundings beyond what is necessary for context (living room).\n*   **Clarity and Specificity:** It uses simple, clear language and is very specific, detailing that only the head moves while the body and feet do not.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids all subjective, emotional, or speculative language (e.g., \"he looks around curiously\").\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise while remaining fully informative.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a perfect example of what was requested. It is a clear, objective, and chronologically accurate description of the subject's motion.",
