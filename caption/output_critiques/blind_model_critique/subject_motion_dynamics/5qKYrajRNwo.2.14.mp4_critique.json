    "pre_caption": "The girl, dressed in a dark blue dress, is seen in a dimly lit room with a wooden chest and a lantern on the table. She picks up a golden pocket watch from the chest and holds it up to her face, examining it closely. Her expression changes to a gentle smile as she continues to look at the watch. She then raises the watch higher, still smiling, and appears to be speaking softly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young girl with long, dark braided hair and a light skin tone. She is wearing a dark blue dress and is engaged with a small, open chest. In her hands, she holds a golden pocket watch, examining it closely. Her facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile, indicating interest and satisfaction. The setting suggests an intimate, focused moment as she interacts with the object.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it correctly presents the actions in chronological order, it includes forbidden elements like static descriptions, subjective adjectives, and speculative language.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events. The actions described (picking up a watch, examining it, smiling, raising it) are clear and easy to follow.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption provides a complete narrative of the subject's main actions from beginning to end within the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** This is where the caption fails significantly.\n    *   **Violation of \"Focus on Motion\":** The first sentence, \"The girl, dressed in a dark blue dress, is seen in a dimly lit room with a wooden chest and a lantern on the table,\" describes the subject's appearance and the static setting. The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid Emotional or Subjective Adjectives\":** The phrase \"gentle smile\" is subjective. \"Gentle\" is an emotional interpretation of the smile. The instruction is to avoid such adjectives. A better description would be simply \"she smiles.\"\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculative Statements\":** The caption uses the phrase \"appears to be speaking softly,\" which directly violates the rule to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" It should describe only what is certain, such as \"her lips move.\"\n\n### Corrected Example:\n\nFollowing the instructions, a better caption would be:\n\nA girl picks up a golden pocket watch from a wooden chest, holds it close to her face, and looks at it. She then smiles, raises the watch, and moves her lips.",
