    "pre_caption": "The video shows a red sports car drifting along a winding road. It navigates a sharp curve, with white smoke billowing from its rear tires due to high-speed motion and tire friction. The car maintains a dynamic movement as it continues around the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a red sports car prominently drifting on a winding road. The car is sleek and low to the ground, with visible white smoke billowing from its rear tires, indicating high-speed motion and tire friction. It has a distinctive racing number \"GUMOUT 411\" on the side, enhancing its sporty appearance. The car is navigating a sharp curve, with its dynamic movement and the smoke trail emphasizing its speed and agility.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it captures the general event, it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is generally accurate in describing that a red sports car is drifting and producing smoke.\n*   However, the phrase \"due to high-speed motion and tire friction\" is an explanation of physics, not a direct observation of the motion itself. The instructions state to describe only what is visible.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption covers the main action (drifting around a curve) and its most prominent effect (smoke). In this regard, it is reasonably complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates multiple core rules:\n\n1.  **Use of Abstract Descriptions:** The instruction explicitly states: \"Avoid abstract descriptions, such as... 'emphasizing its speed and agility.'\" The caption uses this exact forbidden phrase: \"...emphasizing its speed and agility.\"\n2.  **Vague Language:** The phrase \"maintains a dynamic movement\" is vague and does not specify *how* the car is moving, which goes against the instruction to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\"\n3.  **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is introductory text. The instructions require returning \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n4.  **Speculative Statements:** Explaining *why* the smoke appears (\"due to high-speed motion and tire friction\") is an inference, not a direct description of the visible action. The instructions say to \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\"",
