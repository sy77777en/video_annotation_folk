    "pre_caption": "A woman in a blue and white checkered dress quickly moves away from the refrigerator towards a yellow door. She reaches the door and begins to open it. As she opens the door, a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress, along with a man in a mustard yellow sweater, follow her. The man extends his hand towards the child in a colorful patterned outfit and red hat. The child is also seen near the door, and another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, enters the room.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress. A woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress appears partially turned away. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants is seen next, followed by a child in a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat. Finally, a door is opened, revealing another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants. The scene suggests an interaction among the group in a domestic setting.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially effective but has significant issues with adherence to the core instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the events described in the caption are what happens in the video, the description of the actions (moving, opening a door, following, extending a hand, entering) is accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a chronological sequence of events involving multiple people. However, it is incomplete in describing the motion of one subject. The phrase \"The child is also seen near the door\" describes the child's location but fails to describe their motion, which is a key requirement. It's unclear if the child is standing still, walking, or turning.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most significant problems.\n\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Appearance (Major Violation):** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to only use appearance to \"differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption spends an excessive amount of text describing the clothing and appearance of every single person:\n    *   \"A woman in a blue and white checkered dress\"\n    *   \"a woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress\"\n    *   \"a man in a mustard yellow sweater\"\n    *   \"the child in a colorful patterned outfit and red hat\"\n    *   \"another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants\"\n\n    This violates the principle of being concise and focusing on motion. The description becomes cluttered with appearance details instead of highlighting the actions.\n\n*   **Conciseness (Needs Improvement):** Due to the lengthy descriptions of appearance, the caption is not as concise as it could be. These details detract from the primary goal of describing movement.\n\n*   **Specificity of Motion (Needs Improvement):** While some actions are described well (\"extends his hand,\" \"opens it\"), the description of the child's action is weak, as noted under \"Completeness.\"\n\n**In summary:** The caption correctly follows the instructions for chronological order, using simple language, and avoiding speculation. However, it fails significantly on the core instruction to prioritize motion over appearance, making the description unnecessarily long and unfocused. It also misses an opportunity to describe the motion of every subject mentioned.",
