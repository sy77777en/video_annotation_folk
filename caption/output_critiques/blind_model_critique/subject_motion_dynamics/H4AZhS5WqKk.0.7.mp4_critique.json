    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. On the left is a close-up of the head of a large, gray-blue cat with a white muzzle, yellow eyes, and long black whiskers; its expression changes from initially angry to shocked after being punched, and then it becomes even angrier. To the right, a much smaller, full-bodied cat, identical in facial structure but entirely red, is dressed as a devil in red shorts with a pointed tail and red shoes. This red cat, holding a red trident, is positioned on a small white cloud and faces the larger cat with a menacing expression.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to almost all of the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and well-written.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two subjects (a small red cat, a large gray cat) and uses their appearance to differentiate them as instructed. The sequence of actions—the jump, the punch, the landing, and the subsequent standoff—is described precisely as it happens. The interaction is specific (\"punches a large gray cat in the nose\"), and the objects involved (cloud, trident) are included correctly.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It covers the entire motion arc of the main subject (the red cat) from the beginning to the end of the action. It also includes the motion of the cloud (\"floats\") and the key reaction of the secondary subject (\"expression shifts\"), providing a full picture of the events in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows this rule, using words like \"jumps... and punches\" and \"then lands\" to establish a clear timeline.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on actions: \"jumps,\" \"punches,\" \"lands,\" \"floats,\" and \"shifts.\"\n*   **Concise and Specific:** The language is both concise and specific. Instead of \"the cats fight,\" it details the exact punch and its aftermath.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The caption is easy to read and understand.\n*   **No Speculation:** It avoids ambiguous or speculative language.\n*   **Object/Subject Interaction:** The interactions between the red cat and the cloud, and between the two cats, are described clearly and effectively.\n\n### Point for Improvement\nThe only minor deviation from the instructions is the use of the words \"shocked\" and \"angry.\" The instructions state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" While these words efficiently describe the change in the gray cat's facial expression, they are subjective labels for emotions.\n\n*   **To strictly follow the rule**, the description could be more objective, like: \"...the gray cat's eyes widen, and then its brow furrows.\"\n*   **However**, the current phrasing (\"expression shifts from shocked to angry\") is far more concise and natural, which are also key requirements of the instructions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is very good. It successfully balances the need for detailed, objective description with clarity and conciseness. The use of \"shocked\" and \"angry\" is a very minor infraction of one rule in service of another (conciseness and natural language), making it an understandable and effective choice.",
