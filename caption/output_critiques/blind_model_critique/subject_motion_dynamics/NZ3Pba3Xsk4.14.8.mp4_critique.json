    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a red panda with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and black legs. The red panda moves on all fours, occasionally climbing onto a large, horizontal tree branch. Its face is marked with white patches around the eyes and muzzle, and its ears are upright and pointed. The animal’s body is elongated and its tail is held out behind it as it navigates the area. The red panda’s movements are agile and deliberate as it explores its environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption accurately describes a plausible and typical sequence of actions for a red panda. It covers the subject's movement from the ground to a tree branch and its subsequent action on the branch, providing a complete narrative of the motion in the video.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows this rule by describing the actions in sequence: the red panda \"walks... then climbs... It moves along...\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It excels at describing *how* the subject moves, using specific action verbs like \"walks on all fours,\" \"climbs onto,\" and \"moves along.\" The detail \"using its tail for balance\" is an excellent example of describing motion rather than appearance.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is brief, written in simple and natural English, and is easy to understand.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely objective. It avoids emotional or subjective words (e.g., \"gracefully,\" \"cutely\") and speculative phrases (e.g., \"it seems to be looking for food\").\n    *   **Specificity:** It clearly describes the interaction with objects (\"walks across the grass,\" \"climbs onto a... tree branch\") without being overly detailed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that successfully follows all the provided instructions. It is concise, informative, objective, and focuses specifically on the subject's motion in a clear chronological order.",
