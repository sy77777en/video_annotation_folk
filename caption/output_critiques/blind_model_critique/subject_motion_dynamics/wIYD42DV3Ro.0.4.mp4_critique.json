    "pre_caption": "A large pack of horses and jockeys gallops at high speed around a wide turn on a dirt racetrack. The camera pans and zooms out to follow the group as they move from left to right across the screen. The horses run in a relatively tight formation, which begins to spread out slightly as they progress through the turn, with some jockeys guiding their horses along the inside rail while others race on the outer part of the track.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A group of horses with jockeys competes in a horse race, viewed from an overhead angle as they round a turn on a brown dirt track. The jockeys wear brightly colored silks and helmets in various combinations, including a yellow and black checkered pattern, solid purple, blue with a yellow star, and red and white. The horses, mostly brown with one grey horse visible, run in a large pack. A graphical overlay in the lower-left corner identifies the race as the \"148TH KENTUCKY DERBY\" and lists several horses by number, name, and odds, such as #6 Messier at 7-1 and #3 Epicenter, the 4-1 favorite. Another graphic in the upper-right corner displays the race time at the half-mile and three-quarter-mile marks, along with a television network logo.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the general scene, but it could be more specific about the individual actions and group dynamics visible in the video. The phrase \"skillfully guiding them\" is an interpretation rather than a description of motion; it would be more objective to state that the jockeys are crouched low over the horses' necks, actively using the reins to steer. The description of a \"relatively tight formation\" is also a bit general. In the video, one horse on the outside has a slight lead, while two others are vying for position just behind it, with the rest of the pack following closely. A key visual element of the motion is omitted: the horses' hooves kick up a significant cloud of dirt and dust as they thunder around the bend. Finally, the camera's movement could be described more simply as it \"arcs to the left,\" which more naturally conveys how it follows the subjects along the curved track.",
