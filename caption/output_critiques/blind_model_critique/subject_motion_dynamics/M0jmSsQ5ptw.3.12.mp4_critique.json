    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A tan-skinned woman with dark hair pulled back in a white headband is shown performing an athletic maneuver. She wears a pink tank top and black capri-length leggings. While running along a blue mat, she leaps over a low, white, table-like obstacle.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (\"a woman\"), the key objects she interacts with (\"a long blue mat,\" \"a low, white obstacle\"), and the specific actions she performs. The description of the leap—\"extending one leg forward\"—is a precise detail that accurately captures the form of a hurdle, making the description very clear.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete and self-contained description of the subject's motion from the beginning to the end of the sequence. It covers the approach, the interaction with the obstacle, and the action following the interaction, leaving no gaps in the primary movement.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption perfectly adheres to all the given instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, logical sequence: she runs, then leaps, then lands, and finally continues running.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on the woman's movements (\"runs,\" \"approaching,\" \"leaps,\" \"extending,\" \"lands,\" \"continues running\") rather than her appearance.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs and descriptions. Instead of a generic \"jumps,\" it says \"leaps over the obstacle, extending one leg forward,\" which is a much more descriptive and precise account of the action.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is simple, direct, and free of any emotional, subjective, or speculative words (e.g., \"gracefully,\" \"it appears\").\n*   **Conciseness:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that conveys all the necessary information without unnecessary words or abstract phrasing.\n*   **Object Interaction:** The interaction between the woman and the obstacle is clearly defined (\"leaps over the obstacle\").",
