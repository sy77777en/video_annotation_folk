    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures a person with short, black hair featuring a light blue streak above their left eye. They have a fair complexion and are wearing dark eye makeup that accentuates their eyes. The camera is positioned above them, capturing a bird's eye view as they look upwards to make eye contact. Their lips are slightly parted, and they are wearing a red shirt or sweater with black stripes, though it is slightly out of focus. The lighting highlights their facial features, providing a clear and focused view of their face.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the high-angle perspective and the chronological order of the head tilt followed by the focus change, it lacks detail about the quality and context of the motion. The description could be improved by first establishing the subject's initial state; for instance, the video might begin with the person's head bowed and their face obscured or out of focus. The caption starts mid-action (\"the person's head tilts\") without this crucial starting point. Furthermore, the description of the motion is generic. Instead of just a \"tilt,\" imagining the video, the movement could be slow and deliberate, a key detail that sets the tone. The interaction with the camera could also be more specific; rather than just looking \"upward toward the camera,\" the person might be making direct and sustained eye contact, which is a more powerful and precise description of the action. Finally, the phrase \"bringing their face into a clearer view\" is redundant after mentioning the focus sharpens. A stronger caption would specify the target of the focus pull, such as the focus racking to sharpen specifically on the person's eyes as they meet the camera's gaze.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with the person's head bowed, their face initially obscured and out of focus. Slowly and deliberately, they tilt their head to the right, lifting their gaze to make direct and sustained eye contact with the camera. As this motion unfolds, the focus shifts precisely to sharpen on their eyes, capturing the intensity of their gaze.",
