    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person with light-colored skin holds a blue smartphone circuit board with both hands, a gold-colored ring visible on their left ring finger. The circuit board features a prominent camera module with three lenses set in silver-colored metal housings. A large, silver-colored metal shield covers a central portion of the board, surrounded by various small electronic components, connectors, and thin black wires. The person uses a silver-colored precision screwdriver with a knurled handle to point at and touch the smallest of the three camera lenses.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and adheres very well to all the given instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a person), the objects they are interacting with (a blue smartphone circuit board, a silver-colored precision screwdriver, a camera lens), and the specific actions being performed. The description of the screwdriver touching and then wiggling the lens, causing it to move, is a precise and factual account of the motion.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It describes the entire sequence of motion in a logical, chronological order. It starts with the static action of holding the board, moves to the initial contact, and finishes with the primary motion of wiggling the lens and the lens's resulting movement. It captures all the essential motion without leaving out key steps.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are perfectly described in chronological order: holding the board, touching the lens, and then wiggling the lens.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption focuses entirely on motion (\"holds... steady,\" \"touch,\" \"wiggles,\" \"move slightly back and forth\") rather than static appearance.\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. The paragraph is concise and gets straight to the point.\n*   **Object Interaction:** It excels at describing the interaction between the subject and objects. It clearly states that the person uses a screwdriver to wiggle the lens and specifies the effect of this action (\"causing it to move slightly back and forth\").\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The caption avoids speculative language (\"appears to,\" \"might be\") and emotional or subjective adjectives. The word \"gently\" is used, but in this context, it serves as a factual descriptor of the low force being applied, which is an observable aspect of the motion, rather than an emotional interpretation.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The description is concrete and avoids abstract interpretations like \"showcasing a delicate repair.\"\n*   **Format:** It is a single, well-formed paragraph as requested.",
