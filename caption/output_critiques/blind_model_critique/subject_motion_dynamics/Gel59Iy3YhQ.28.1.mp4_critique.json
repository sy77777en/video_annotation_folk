    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video shows a first-person perspective from the video game Minecraft, focusing on the construction of a large structure high in the sky. The structure is made of smooth, white blocks and is built in a stepped, layered fashion, creating a sweeping arc. The player appears well-prepared for actively adding to the structure, as seen from the viewpoint of holding a white block. At the bottom of the screen, an inventory bar displays a selection of available blocks, including white, light blue, diamond, red, and black blocks, as well as a red flower. In the top-left corner, a small avatar of the player character is visible, showing a figure with light skin, orange hair, a green shirt, and dark grey pants.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, which is crucial for describing the motion. It accurately describes the sequence of events: the initial static view, the action of placing a block, and the subsequent stationary state. The description of the action itself—placing a single block to extend a row—is precise and factual.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It covers the entire sequence of motion within the video clip, from the initial setup to the action and its conclusion. It successfully establishes the context (aiming at a structure), describes the primary action (placing the block), and notes the final state (view remains stationary), leaving no gaps in the description of the motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in perfect chronological order: aiming, placing, and remaining stationary.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description centers on the subject's action (\"places a single white block\") and the state of the camera's view, which represents the subject's movement in a first-person video.\n*   **Specificity:** It excels in specificity. Instead of a generic \"the player builds,\" it details that the player \"places a single white block, adding it to the end of a row,\" which clearly describes the interaction and its effect as instructed.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and direct, resulting in a concise and easy-to-understand paragraph.\n*   **Avoided Elements:** The caption successfully avoids all prohibited elements: there are no emotional or subjective adjectives, no speculative language (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), and no abstract descriptions. It sticks strictly to what is visible.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, creating a description that is accurate, complete, and highly informative about the subject's motion in a clear and objective manner.",
