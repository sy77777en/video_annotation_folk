    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video shows a first-person perspective from the video game Minecraft, focusing on the construction of a large structure high in the sky. The structure is made of smooth, white blocks and is built in a stepped, layered fashion, creating a sweeping arc. The player appears well-prepared for actively adding to the structure, as seen from the viewpoint of holding a white block. At the bottom of the screen, an inventory bar displays a selection of available blocks, including white, light blue, diamond, red, and black blocks, as well as a red flower. In the top-left corner, a small avatar of the player character is visible, showing a figure with light skin, orange hair, a green shirt, and dark grey pants.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and the general trajectory of movement, but it describes the motion in overly simplistic terms. The phrase \"the view continues moving forward\" is too generic; in the video, the player is clearly flying or gliding smoothly through the air towards the floating white structure, an important detail about the specific type of motion. Furthermore, the caption ends prematurely. It mentions the player is holding a white block and reaches a column, but it omits the final, crucial action shown in the video: the player places the held block onto the top of the white column, completing a sequence of movement and interaction. A more complete description would specify the mode of travel and include this concluding action to fully capture the chronological motion.",
