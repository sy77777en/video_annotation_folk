    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large airplane with a distinctive tail design crashing into a building, causing significant damage to the structure. The airplane's nose and wings are severely bent and crushed against the building, with debris scattered around the impact site. Smoke is billowing from the damaged area, and the building's roof is partially collapsed, indicating a severe structural failure. The tarmac is wet, reflecting the lights from the scene, and the surrounding area appears to be an airport or airfield.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large passenger airplane with a distinctive tail design, which has collided with a building. The aircraft is silver and white, with a prominent dark emblem on the tail that resembles a bird. The building, which appears to be a hangar, is partially collapsed, with debris scattered around the impact site. Smoke is rising from the damaged area, and the structure is illuminated by bright lights, highlighting the extent of the destruction. The scene is set on a wet tarmac, reflecting the lights and adding to the dramatic visual impact.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. It fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Focus on Motion:** The primary flaw is that the caption describes a static scene (the aftermath of a crash) while using a verb that implies action (\"crashing\"). The instructions require describing the subject's motion *in the video*. The descriptions of the plane being \"bent and crushed,\" \"debris scattered,\" and \"smoke billowing\" all point to a static scene *after* the crash has occurred. If the video only shows the aftermath, the caption should state that the plane is stationary amidst the wreckage. If the video shows the actual impact, the description of the motion is insufficient and not in chronological order.\n\n*   **Describing the Unseen/Speculation:** The caption describes the action of \"crashing,\" which is an inference about a past event rather than a description of what is currently visible in the video. Furthermore, it uses the speculative phrase \"appears to be an airport or airfield,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'\".\n\n*   **Adherence to \"No Movement\" Rule:** If the video shows a static scene with no movement from the main subject (the plane), the instructions state to \"briefly mention that.\" This caption fails to do so, instead inventing an action (\"crashing\") that is likely not depicted.\n\n*   **Use of Adjectives:** While descriptive, phrases like \"significant damage\" and \"severe structural failure\" lean towards being evaluative rather than purely objective descriptions of the scene, which goes against the spirit of avoiding emotional or subjective language.",
