    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person's light-skinned hand, which has glowing, light-blue, vein-like markings on its back, gently pets a small, fantastical creature. The creature is round, covered in dark blue, velvety fur, and has large, black, expressive eyes. Atop its head is a crown-like arrangement of green leaves and small, brown, twig-like horns. The person's fingers stroke the creature's belly, causing it to close its eyes and nuzzle into the touch with a content expression. At the end of the video, the creature looks down and appears surprised by the markings.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly follows a chronological order, but it relies on a subjective interpretation of emotion by stating the creature's expression changes to 'surprise,' which violates the instructions. Instead, it should describe the specific physical changes that convey this, such as the creature's eyes suddenly widening, its ears perking up, and its mouth falling slightly open. The term 'nuzzling' is also somewhat ambiguous; a more precise description, like 'arches its back and presses its head into the hand,' would better capture the specific motion seen in the video. Furthermore, the caption could enhance clarity by specifying the nature of the stroking motion (e.g., a finger moving back and forth across its stomach) and by establishing the creature's initial posture, such as lying on its back, to provide a clearer starting point for the sequence of actions.",
