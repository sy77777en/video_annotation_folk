    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a view of a cityscape featuring a prominent bridge with a metal framework, surrounded by tall buildings and power lines. As the camera moves forward, the bridge becomes more prominent, and the details of its structure, including its support beams and towers, are clearly visible. The camera continues to move closer, revealing more of the bridge's intricate design and the vehicles traveling on it. The background includes a river below the bridge and a mix of modern and older buildings. The camera finally focuses on the bridge's central tower and the power lines running parallel to it, providing a detailed view of the bridge's architecture and the surrounding urban environment.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the video's content. It correctly identifies a camera moving toward a bridge in a cityscape and notes the presence of vehicles.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description of the secondary subjects' motion is incomplete and too generic. The phrase \"vehicles traveling on it\" does not provide specific details about their movement as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to follow the instructions in two critical ways:\n\n1.  **Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption does the opposite. The majority of the text is dedicated to describing the static appearance of the scene, such as the \"metal framework,\" \"tall buildings,\" \"support beams,\" \"intricate design,\" and \"bridge's architecture.\" This violates the core requirement of the prompt.\n\n2.  **Specificity of Action:** The instruction asks for specific descriptions of motion (e.g., \"a runner sprints\"). The caption's description of the cars as \"vehicles traveling on it\" is a generic description, not a specific one.\n\nWhile the caption correctly uses chronological order, simple language, and an objective tone, its fundamental failure to prioritize motion over static description makes it a poor fit for the instructions. A good caption would have focused solely on the camera's forward movement and the motion of the vehicles on the bridge, omitting the detailed architectural and scenic descriptions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with the camera smoothly gliding toward a bustling bridge in a vibrant cityscape. As the camera advances, it captures the dynamic flow of cars and buses zipping across the bridge, weaving through lanes with precision. The vehicles' headlights and taillights create a lively dance of light against the backdrop of the city. The camera continues its journey, honing in on the bridge's central tower, while power lines sway gently in the breeze, paralleling the bridge's path. The scene concludes with a focus on the rhythmic movement of traffic, highlighting the bridge as a vital artery in the urban landscape.",
