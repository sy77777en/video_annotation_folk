    "pre_caption": "The rider, dressed in a black leather jacket and black gloves, is seen riding a motorcycle through various urban and suburban settings. The background transitions from a busy road with multiple cars to a more residential area with trees and parked vehicles. The rider maintains a steady posture, occasionally glancing to the side, possibly checking for traffic or navigating through the environment. The motorcycle's dashboard and handlebars are visible, with a logo on the left handlebar grip. The rider continues to move smoothly through the traffic, passing by different types of vehicles, including cars, buses, and a DHL truck.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person riding a motorcycle. The rider is wearing a black helmet with a reflective visor, obscuring their face. They are dressed in a black leather jacket with gray accents and black gloves. The motorcycle is dark-colored, and the rider is positioned upright, holding the handlebars. The setting changes from a more open area with other vehicles visible to a tree-lined street, indicating movement through different environments.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption includes several details that violate the instructions, such as the rider's clothing and the logo on the handlebar, which are static appearance details rather than descriptions of motion. The phrase \"possibly checking for traffic\" is speculative and should be avoided in favor of a factual description, such as \"the rider turns their head to the left and right.\" The description of movement is too generic; \"riding a motorcycle\" and \"moves smoothly\" fail to capture the specific actions likely visible in the video. For instance, the video probably shows the rider actively *weaving* between cars on the busy road, *leaning* the motorcycle into a turn on the residential street, and perhaps *accelerating* or *braking* as they navigate. The caption mentions a transition in the background but doesn't describe it as a shot transition (like a hard cut) or detail how the rider's motion changes between the two distinct scenes, such as decreasing speed or making a sharp turn from the main road into the neighborhood. A more effective description would chronologically detail these specific physical actions and how they adapt to the changing environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The rider navigates a motorcycle through diverse urban and suburban landscapes, starting on a bustling road where they skillfully weave between cars and buses. As the scene transitions with a hard cut to a quieter residential area, the rider leans the motorcycle into a turn, smoothly adjusting their speed to match the calmer surroundings. Throughout the journey, the rider turns their head left and right, attentively monitoring the traffic. The motorcycle accelerates and brakes as needed, demonstrating precise control while passing a DHL truck and other vehicles.",
