    "pre_caption": "The video shows a woman standing in a dimly lit room with a closed door in the background. She is wearing a patterned headscarf and a dark jacket over a light-colored top. The woman is speaking, and subtitles appear on the screen, indicating a conversation. The subtitles read: 'Is that you, Fardosa? - Yeah, mom. How was the party? - It was alright. I'll tell you about it tomorrow. Okay. Remember to pray.' The woman's expression remains calm and composed throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with a medium to dark skin tone, wearing a patterned headscarf that covers her hair. Her profile is visible, showing a calm expression. She is dressed in a dark-colored top with a light-colored collar. The lighting is warm and dim, casting soft shadows on her face. Her presence is central to the video, and she is engaged in a conversation.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject and presents her actions in chronological order, but it could be more precise and objective. The phrase \"maintaining a calm and composed expression\" is subjective and should be replaced with a description of physical action; for instance, if she is speaking, the caption could note that her mouth moves as she talks. The description \"moves closer to the camera\" is vague; a more specific description, such as \"leans her upper body forward from the waist,\" would better clarify the motion. Finally, the statement \"the camera captures the right side of her face\" describes the camera's framing rather than the subject's action. It would be more effective to focus solely on her movement, such as \"she turns her head to her left, holding the position for a moment before turning back to face the camera.\" This keeps the focus on the subject's motion as instructed.",
