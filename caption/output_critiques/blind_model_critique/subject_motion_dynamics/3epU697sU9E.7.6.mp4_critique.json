    "pre_caption": "A man in a dark suit stands at a wooden podium, speaking to a group of people. He has short, gray hair and is facing the audience, suggesting he is the main subject. To his right, there are two flags, one of which is the American flag, and in the foreground on the right side of the frame, two more American flags are visible. In front of him, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, is holding a microphone towards him, indicating a press event. Several other individuals, including photographers and journalists, are gathered around, some holding cameras and recording equipment. The setting appears to be a formal room with framed portraits on the walls, contributing to the official atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a photograph that slowly and subtly zooms in on a man in a dark suit standing at a wooden podium, appearing to address a group of people. He has short, gray hair and is facing the audience, suggesting he is the main subject. To his right, there are two flags, one of which is the American flag, and in the foreground on the right side of the frame, two more American flags are visible. In front of him, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, is holding a microphone towards him, indicating a press event. Several other individuals, including photographers and journalists, are gathered around, some holding cameras and recording equipment. The setting appears to be a formal room with framed portraits on the walls, contributing to the official atmosphere.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption accurately identifies the subjects and setting but fails to describe any motion, treating the video as a static photograph. It focuses excessively on appearance details like the man's \"short, gray hair\" and the presence of flags and portraits, which the instructions advise against. A more effective description would detail the specific actions of the main subject. For instance, the video might show the man gesturing with his left hand to emphasize a point, then pausing to look down at the podium, before looking up and making eye contact with different sections of the audience. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the subtle movements of secondary subjects, such as the woman adjusting the microphone's position or a photographer in the background raising a camera to capture a shot, which would better convey the dynamic nature of a press event. The current caption describes a scene, but not the actions occurring within it, which is the primary goal of the instruction.",
