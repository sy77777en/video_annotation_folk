    "pre_caption": "A man in a dark suit stands at a wooden podium, speaking to a group of people. He has short, gray hair and is facing the audience, suggesting he is the main subject. To his right, there are two flags, one of which is the American flag, and in the foreground on the right side of the frame, two more American flags are visible. In front of him, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, is holding a microphone towards him, indicating a press event. Several other individuals, including photographers and journalists, are gathered around, some holding cameras and recording equipment. The setting appears to be a formal room with framed portraits on the walls, contributing to the official atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a photograph that slowly and subtly zooms in on a man in a dark suit standing at a wooden podium, appearing to address a group of people. He has short, gray hair and is facing the audience, suggesting he is the main subject. To his right, there are two flags, one of which is the American flag, and in the foreground on the right side of the frame, two more American flags are visible. In front of him, a woman with light hair, wearing a white shirt, is holding a microphone towards him, indicating a press event. Several other individuals, including photographers and journalists, are gathered around, some holding cameras and recording equipment. The setting appears to be a formal room with framed portraits on the walls, contributing to the official atmosphere.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It fails to follow the core instructions in several critical ways.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Primary Failure: Focus on Motion:** The main instruction is to describe the subject's **motion**. This caption almost exclusively describes a static scene, focusing on what people are wearing, their appearance, the objects they are holding, and the setting. Phrases like \"stands at a wooden podium,\" \"has short, gray hair,\" \"there are two flags,\" and \"holding a microphone\" describe a state, not an action or movement. The only action mentioned is \"speaking,\" which is too generic and lacks the specific detail requested by the instructions (e.g., \"The man speaks from the podium, gesturing with his right hand\").\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid\" Rules:**\n    *   **Speculative Language:** The caption uses speculative phrases like \"suggesting he is the main subject,\" \"indicating a press event,\" and \"The setting appears to be a formal room.\" The instructions explicitly forbid such statements (\"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears'\").\n    *   **Subjective Descriptions:** The phrase \"contributing to the official atmosphere\" is a subjective interpretation, which the instructions advise against.\n    *   **Focus on Appearance/Setting:** The caption is filled with details about the man's suit and hair, the woman's hair and shirt, the flags, and the portraits on the walls. The instructions state to \"focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n\n*   **Lack of Specificity in Action:** The instructions ask for specific descriptions of actions (e.g., \"a runner sprints\"). The caption's only action word, \"speaking,\" is a generic description that does not detail *how* the subject is moving while performing the action.\n\nIn summary, the caption reads like a description of a still photograph rather than a video. It ignores the central command to describe motion and violates several negative constraints, such as avoiding speculation and subjective language. A good caption would have focused entirely on the movements of the people, such as \"A man stands at a podium and speaks, occasionally gesturing with his hands, while a woman holds a microphone steady in front of him.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man in a dark suit stands at a wooden podium, speaking animatedly to a group of people. He gestures with his right hand to emphasize his points, while a woman with light hair holds a microphone steadily in front of him. Photographers and journalists move around, adjusting their cameras and recording equipment to capture the event.",
