    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort, with a glowing blue dot starting its journey along a highlighted path. The camera gradually zooms out, revealing more of the cityscape and the surrounding water. The blue dot continues to move along the path, passing through various areas of the city. As the camera pulls back further, Emma E. Booker Elementary School is marked on the map, and the blue dot approaches it. The video concludes with the blue dot nearing the school, highlighting the route taken.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video simulates a satellite camera view of a coastal city, starting with an extreme wide shot that gradually reveals a broader landscape. Two key locations are marked: The Colony Beach & Tennis Resort and Emma E. Booker Elementary School. An orange line highlights a route connecting these two places, traversing the cityscape. A blue dot moves along the orange line, representing someone traveling along the highlighted route. The scene focuses on the geographical layout, with the path prominently displayed, emphasizing the connection between the marked locations.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video sequence, likely a map animation showing a route. It correctly identifies the primary moving subject (\"a glowing blue dot\") and the secondary motion (\"The camera gradually zooms out\"). The landmarks mentioned serve as start and end points, which is consistent with this type of video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is complete, covering the video from beginning to end. It establishes the starting point, describes the progression of both the dot and the camera's perspective, and clearly states the conclusion of the action.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given rules perfectly:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, sequential order using phrases like \"begins with,\" \"gradually zooms out,\" \"continues to move,\" and \"concludes with.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on movement—the dot's journey along the path and the camera's zooming motion. It avoids static descriptions of the city or buildings.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is brief yet provides all the essential information about what happens in the video.\n*   **Simple and Objective Language:** It uses clear, natural English and avoids emotional, subjective (\"beautiful,\" \"impressive\"), or speculative (\"it seems,\" \"might be\") language. The word \"glowing\" is a neutral descriptor of appearance necessary to identify the subject.\n*   **Specific Actions:** It specifies the type of motion, such as \"starting its journey along a highlighted path,\" \"gradually zooms out,\" and \"approaches it,\" which is more descriptive than generic terms.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids abstract interpretations like \"emphasizing the efficiency of the route.\"\n*   **Correct Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.",
