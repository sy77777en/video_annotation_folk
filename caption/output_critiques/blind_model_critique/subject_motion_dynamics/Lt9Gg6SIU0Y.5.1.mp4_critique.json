    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a dense array of small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, forming intricate patterns that suggest depth and perspective. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, with some appearing more prominent than others, and are distributed along lines that converge toward a central vanishing point, creating a tunnel-like or starburst effect. The overall composition is abstract, with no recognizable people, animals, or objects, and the visual focus is on the geometric arrangement and luminous quality of the blue dots as they form dynamic, radiating structures.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary motion of the blue dots along converging lines and notes the bidirectional movement, it relies on interpretive language and misses key observable details. Phrases like \"creating the appearance of traveling through a tunnel\" and \"enhancing the sense of depth and perspective\" describe the subjective effect on the viewer rather than the literal, objective motion of the dots, which the instructions advise against. Furthermore, the description of dots approaching and receding is vague. A more precise caption would detail *how* this effect is achieved. For example, it fails to mention that the dots moving outward from the central point likely increase in size and brightness as they approach the edges of the frame, while the dots moving inward from the periphery simultaneously shrink and dim as they travel toward the central vanishing point. Describing these changes in size and luminosity is a critical component of the motion itself and would provide a more complete and concrete picture without resorting to abstract interpretation.",

As the motion continues, dots moving outward from the central point increase in size and brightness as they approach the edges of the frame, while dots moving inward from the periphery shrink and dim as they travel toward the central vanishing point. This bidirectional movement and change in size and luminosity create a dynamic visual effect throughout the video.",
