    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video's content, here is the feedback on the provided caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects (a man and a woman), their motion (walking away), the camera's motion (panning to the right), the setting (a wooden walkway at a zoo), and the actions of the secondary subjects (other visitors standing and walking).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It captures all the essential movements in the video in chronological order. It effectively describes the main action of the couple being followed by the camera, while also providing context by mentioning the background visitors and their general activities. It appropriately includes the camera's movement, which is a dominant motion in the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the given instruction:**\nThe caption adheres excellently to the instructions.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and brief summary of the video's action.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description of the continuous pan and the subjects walking away is inherently chronological.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It focuses entirely on the movement of the subjects and the camera (\"pans to the right,\" \"walk away,\" \"standing and walking\").\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses neutral, objective language and avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative terms.\n*   **Specificity:** It clearly describes the individual actions (\"a man and a woman as they walk away\") and the collective behavior of the background group (\"Other visitors are seen standing and walking\").\n*   **Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n\nIn summary, the caption is very good. It is an accurate, complete, and well-structured description that perfectly follows all the provided guidelines.",
