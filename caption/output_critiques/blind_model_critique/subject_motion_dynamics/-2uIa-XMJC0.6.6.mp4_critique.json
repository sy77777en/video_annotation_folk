    "pre_caption": "The scene is set on a bridge with a cityscape in the background, featuring modern buildings and a body of water. A police van is parked on the bridge, and a person in white is standing at the van's door, balancing on a skateboard. A person in dark jetpack gear approaches the van and blocks the white-clad person's path. Another person in similar jetpack gear runs to the front of the van. The person in white takes off into the air, and the other two leap towards him. They collide mid-air and fall to the edge of the bridge.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In the video, a large police van, predominantly black with blue and yellow markings and red/yellow chevrons on the rear, is parked on a bridge over water. A light-skinned person wearing a white hood, dressed in a white top and white pants, is standing at the van's door, balancing on a hovering skateboard. A person wearing a dark grey/black jetpack, including a helmet that obscures their face, blocks the white-clad person’s way. Another person in identical tactical gear runs to the front of the van holding a weapon. Finally, as the person in white takes off into the air, the other two leap toward him. The two collide midair, and all three tumble down to the edge of the bridge.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological overview, but it lacks specificity regarding the nature of the movements, which seem to be from an action or sci-fi context. The description of the person in white \"balancing on a skateboard\" could be more dynamic; for instance, the video might show them rocking back and forth, poised for escape. The phrase \"takes off into the air\" is a critical omission of detail; it should specify *how* they take off—perhaps the skateboard ignites and functions as a hoverboard, launching them vertically. Similarly, \"the other two leap towards him\" undersells the action; a more accurate description might be that they \"ignite their jetpacks and launch themselves horizontally\" to intercept. The term \"collide\" is too generic for what is likely a dynamic mid-air tackle or grapple. Finally, \"fall to the edge of the bridge\" is passive; the video probably shows them crashing down in a tangle of limbs, skidding across the pavement, and stopping just short of the guardrail, which would be a more descriptive account of the motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene unfolds on a bridge with a cityscape backdrop, showcasing modern buildings and a shimmering body of water. A police van is stationed on the bridge, and a person dressed in white is dynamically rocking back and forth on a skateboard, poised for a swift escape. Suddenly, a figure in sleek, dark jetpack gear approaches, blocking the white-clad individual's path, while another similarly equipped person dashes to the front of the van. In a dramatic turn, the person in white ignites their skateboard, transforming it into a hoverboard that launches them vertically into the air. In response, the two jetpack-wearing figures ignite their gear, propelling themselves horizontally in a high-speed interception attempt. They engage in a dynamic mid-air tackle, colliding in a flurry of motion before crashing down in a tangled heap, skidding across the pavement and halting just short of the bridge's guardrail.",
