    "pre_caption": "On a red sports court surrounded by a metal fence, a group of eight people are engaged in a game. The central figure, wearing a green jacket and white pants, holds a basketball and begins to throw it upwards. As the basketball ascends, it starts to transform, revealing a face on its surface. The basketball continues to rise, and its face becomes more prominent, while the people around it watch. The basketball, now fully transformed into a ball with a face, moves closer to the camera, speaking as it does so.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features eight people on a red sports court. Six individuals form a circle facing a person in the center, while another person stands outside the circle. A basketball, initially held by a person in the group, becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground, revealing a face imprinted on its surface. This transition highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus from the group interaction to the ball itself.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible and coherent sequence of events. It correctly identifies the setting (sports court), the subjects (a group of people), the main character (person in a green jacket), and the central object/character (the basketball that transforms). The described actions—throwing, ascending, transforming, and moving toward the camera—are all clear and specific.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete, end-to-end description of the motion in the video. It starts with the initial action (throwing the ball), details the key transformation in the middle, and describes the final action (the transformed ball moving and speaking). It successfully captures the entire narrative arc of the motion without leaving out any critical steps.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the specific guidelines almost perfectly:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, logical sequence: the person throws the ball, the ball ascends and transforms, it continues to rise, and then it moves closer to the camera.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption is rich with specific motion-related verbs like \"holds,\" \"begins to throw,\" \"ascends,\" \"starts to transform,\" \"revealing,\" \"continues to rise,\" and \"moves closer.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes a complex event (a transforming basketball) in a single, clear paragraph without unnecessary words.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The language is objective and factual. It avoids emotional words, opinions, and ambiguous phrases like \"it seems to\" or \"it might be.\"\n*   **Specific Actions:** It excels here. Instead of saying \"the ball changes,\" it details *how*: \"it starts to transform, revealing a face on its surface\" and \"its face becomes more prominent.\"\n*   **Subject Interaction:** It clearly describes the main subject's interaction with the object (\"holds a basketball and begins to throw it\") and the secondary subjects' action (\"the people around it watch\").\n*   **Revealing Subject:** The description of the basketball transforming and \"revealing a face\" is a perfect example of how to handle a subject that appears or changes, as requested by the instructions.\n\nThe only minor point of critique is the mention of the ball \"speaking.\" The instructions emphasize describing visible motion. \"Speaking\" is an auditory action. A more strictly compliant caption might say, \"its mouth moves,\" but \"speaking\" is a common and concise shorthand that is perfectly understandable and acceptable in this context.\n\n**Overall, this is a high-quality caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of all the core requirements.**",
