Upon reaching the top of the vines, it jumps to a ledge on the left and then continues to ascend by jumping from one ledge to the next. On the ledges, other small, white, bird-like creatures perform subtle, stationary hopping movements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A small, white, pixelated character with a squarish body, two black dots for eyes, and two short legs is depicted climbing a patch of green, pixelated vines. On ledges above this character, there are other small, white, pixelated creatures. These creatures have a blocky, bird-like shape and exhibit subtle hopping movements. All the figures are rendered in a simple, two-dimensional, blocky art style.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the caption is accurate. It describes a \"small, white, squarish character\" and \"small, white, bird-like creatures,\" which suggests it is differentiating between subjects as instructed. The actions described (climbing vines, jumping between ledges) are specific and plausible for an animated or video game scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It describes the entire path of motion for the main subject from start to finish within the clip. It also successfully incorporates the motion of the secondary subjects (\"other...creatures perform subtle, stationary hopping movements\"), providing a full picture of the activity in the video without getting lost in excessive detail.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all the given instructions.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in perfect chronological sequence: the character first \"climbs up a patch of green vines,\" then \"jumps to a ledge,\" and finally \"continues to ascend by jumping.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on motion, using strong, specific verbs like \"climbs,\" \"jumps,\" and \"hopping.\" It avoids describing the static appearance of the subjects beyond what is necessary to identify them.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is a single, coherent unit that is both brief and packed with information about the movements.\n*   **Objectivity and Specificity:** The caption avoids all speculative language (\"appears,\" \"might be\"), emotional adjectives, and abstract descriptions. The description of the secondary subjects' movement as \"subtle, stationary hopping movements\" is an excellent example of being specific and objective.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly identifies a main subject (the \"squarish character\") and details its motion, while also concisely describing the collective behavior of the secondary subjects.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, creating a description that is clear, accurate, objective, and perfectly focused on the chronological sequence of motion.",
