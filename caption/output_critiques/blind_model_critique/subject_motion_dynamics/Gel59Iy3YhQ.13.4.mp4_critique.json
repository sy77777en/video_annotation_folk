    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video presents a first-person perspective moving through a stylized desert canyon. The environment is composed of large, smooth, orange-brown rock formations, some of which rise as blocky pillars from a body of still, blue water on the right. A sandy path, marked by a continuous dark green cable, runs along the base of a massive canyon wall on the left. Scattered throughout the scene are small, bright green, low-poly bushes. As the perspective advances, a building becomes the central focus. It is a wooden structure with a reddish-brown roof, exposed beams, and partially open walls, situated on a rocky outcrop. A small, square window with a blue frame is visible on one of its orange-colored walls.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible and clear sequence of events. It details the movement of a first-person camera through a specific environment, which is a common video scenario.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It captures the primary motion (\"moves steadily forward\"), a secondary motion (\"pans slightly to the right\"), and the relationship between the camera's movement and key elements in the scene (\"following a dark green cable,\" \"bringing a wooden building... into closer view\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented logically and chronologically. The forward movement is the primary action, and the pan is described as occurring during that advance.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption is centered entirely on motion (\"moves steadily forward,\" \"following,\" \"pans,\" \"advances,\" \"bringing... into closer view\"). It avoids describing the static appearance of the canyon or building beyond what is necessary for context.\n    *   **Concise and Specific:** It uses precise language (\"first-person perspective,\" \"pans slightly,\" \"rocky outcrop\") to create a clear picture without being wordy. It avoids generic terms like \"the camera moves.\"\n    *   **Objective Language:** The caption uses neutral, descriptive words (\"steadily,\" \"sandy,\" \"dark green,\" \"wooden\") and completely avoids subjective, emotional, or speculative language.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n    *   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids abstract interpretations like \"creating a sense of exploration.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The first-person perspective steadily advances along a sandy path within a canyon, tracing a dark green cable on the ground. As the camera moves, it slightly pans to the right, gradually bringing a wooden building perched on a rocky outcrop into clearer view.",
