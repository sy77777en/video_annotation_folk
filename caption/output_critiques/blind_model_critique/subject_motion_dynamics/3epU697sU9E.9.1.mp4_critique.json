    "pre_caption": "The video shows a dark map of the northeastern United States with a highlighted route connecting Offut Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews. The route is marked by a dashed orange line, and a small orange plane-like icon moves along the line, indicating an ongoing flight. The bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons marking their positions on the map. The map displays state boundaries and major cities in a subtle gray, providing geographical context. The overall visual emphasizes the connection between these two military bases.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a dark map of the northeastern United States with a highlighted route connecting two locations: Offut Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews. The route is marked by a dashed orange line, suggesting a path or flight trajectory, with a small orange plane-like icon moving along the line to indicate an ongoing flight. Both bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons indicating their positions on the map. The map displays state boundaries and major cities in a subtle gray, providing geographical context. The overall visual emphasizes the connection between these two military bases.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is not good. While it is factually accurate, it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the visual content of the video. It correctly identifies the subject (a plane-like icon), its motion (moving along a dashed line), and the context (a map showing a route between two military bases).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is overly complete. It describes the single, simple motion present in the video, but it also includes extensive details about static background elements (map style, labels, icons, state boundaries, cities), which is unnecessary and goes against the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the following instructions:\n\n1.  **Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption dedicates most of its length to describing the static map (the dark map, the bold orange text, the circular icons, the subtle gray state boundaries and cities) rather than focusing purely on the movement of the plane icon.\n2.  **Avoid Abstract Descriptions:** The caption ends with the sentence, \"The overall visual emphasizes the connection between these two military bases.\" This is an abstract interpretation of the video's purpose, which directly violates the instruction to \"Avoid abstract descriptions, such as '...emphasizing its speed and agility...'\"\n3.  **Conciseness:** Because the caption includes excessive detail about static elements and an abstract conclusion, it is not concise. A better caption would focus only on the essential motion.\n\nA much better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\n\"A small orange plane icon moves from left to right along a dashed orange line on a map, traveling from a point labeled Offut Air Force Base to a point labeled Joint Base Andrews.\"",
