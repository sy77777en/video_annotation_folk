    "pre_caption": "The video shows a dark map of the northeastern United States with a highlighted route connecting Offut Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews. The route is marked by a dashed orange line, and a small orange plane-like icon moves along the line, indicating an ongoing flight. The bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons marking their positions on the map. The map displays state boundaries and major cities in a subtle gray, providing geographical context. The overall visual emphasizes the connection between these two military bases.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a dark map of the northeastern United States with a highlighted route connecting two locations: Offut Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews. The route is marked by a dashed orange line, suggesting a path or flight trajectory, with a small orange plane-like icon moving along the line to indicate an ongoing flight. Both bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons indicating their positions on the map. The map displays state boundaries and major cities in a subtle gray, providing geographical context. The overall visual emphasizes the connection between these two military bases.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main elements, but it lacks specific details about the motion itself. It states that a plane icon \"moves along the line\" but fails to describe the direction and progression of this movement, which is the central action in the video. For instance, the caption should specify that the orange plane icon originates at the icon for Offut Air Force Base and travels steadily eastward along the dashed path toward Joint Base Andrews. Furthermore, the video might show the dashed orange line being drawn in real-time just ahead of or behind the plane icon, dynamically revealing the route as the flight progresses, a key motion detail the current description omits by presenting the line as a static element. The description could be improved by focusing more on this chronological progression of the icon and the potentially dynamic rendering of the path, rather than spending as much text on the static visual characteristics of the map and its labels.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video depicts a dark map of the northeastern United States, highlighting a dynamic route between Offut Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews. An orange plane-like icon originates at Offut Air Force Base and travels steadily eastward along a dashed orange line toward Joint Base Andrews. As the plane icon progresses, the dashed line is drawn in real-time just ahead of it, dynamically revealing the route. The bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons marking their positions. State boundaries and major cities are subtly displayed in gray, providing geographical context while emphasizing the active connection between the two military bases.",
