    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video showcases a user navigating a pixelated computer interface with a purple and green color scheme, reminiscent of a late 1990s operating system. The user explores a fictional internet called \"Hypnospace Explorer,\" moving from a personal homepage to a search results page after looking up \"badguy.\" This leads to a page with the heading \"ILLEGAL CONTENT\" in red, pixelated text. On this page are three animated, pixelated images of young, light-skinned girls standing in a row, each dressed as an angel. They all have golden hair, white halos, and large white wings, and are wearing long, flowing gowns. The girl on the far left is holding a basket of flowers in her right hand, the one in the middle holds a dove in each hand, and the girl on the far right has her hands gently lowered at her sides. The page also displays text that sarcastically identifies the creator and provides a name and address.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly follows the chronological order of events, it lacks specificity and uses clunky phrasing that makes the action feel disconnected. The terms \"a webpage,\" \"a search results page,\" and \"a slim text box\" are too generic; if the video shows, for example, a Wikipedia article and a Google search bar, mentioning this would provide valuable context. The phrase \"the view switches\" is passive, and the subsequent statement \"The cursor moves to this page\" is redundant. Furthermore, the caption fails to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the cursor's click and the appearance of the new page. The description of the final cursor movement to \"a black area\" is also vague; it would be more informative to identify this area if possible, for instance, as an embedded video player or a large image. The quality of the motion itself is also omitted—the initial scrolling could be smooth or staggered, and the cursor's path could be a direct line or a slightly curved, more human-like movement, details which would enhance the description.",
