    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In an outdoor setting, a large, A-frame wooden structure resembling a catapult, with some blue-painted beams, stands on the left. To the right is a translucent dark cloth that allows the blue sky and white clouds to be seen through it. In the foreground, a low structure covered in green artificial turf has a visible layered cross-section of white and tan materials. A white, semi-circular ramp, holding a small white ball, extends from this structure. A single, vertical wooden post rises nearby, connected to the catapult by a taut white string. The white ball rolls down the ramp until it reaches the bottom and strikes a white line, causing the line to loosen and the string to fly loosely through the air, indicating a launch has occurred.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is not good. While it follows some of the basic stylistic instructions, it fails critically in its primary goal: to provide an accurate and informative description of the subject's motion and interactions.\n\n**Accuracy: Poor**\nThe caption's primary flaw is its inaccurate description of the cause-and-effect relationship. It presents two events as simultaneous but separate: \"A taut white string... is released... causing it to fly loosely\" and \"At the same moment, a small white ball is launched from a ramp.\" A catapult mechanism works by the release of tension (the string) *causing* the launch of the projectile (the ball). By describing these as two independent events, the caption misrepresents the fundamental action in the video. The string's release is the direct cause of the ball's launch, not a coincidental event.\n\n**Completeness: Poor**\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to describe the interaction between the components, which is the most essential part of the motion. The instruction states: \"If the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect.\" The caption identifies the catapult, string, and ball but fails to connect their actions. A correct description would explain that the release of the string powers the catapult arm, which in turn strikes or propels the ball from the ramp.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Partial**\n*   **Strengths:** The caption successfully adheres to several instructions. It is concise, uses simple and objective language, avoids speculation and emotional adjectives, and presents the actions chronologically (using \"at the same moment\").\n*   **Weaknesses:** It fails on the most important instructions related to motion:\n    *   It does not \"clearly describe the subject's motion\" because it misses the core mechanical action.\n    *   It does not \"specify the type of interaction and its effect\" between the catapult's string and the ball.\n    *   The description of the string's motion as \"fly loosely through the air\" is vague and not as specific as it could be (e.g., \"whips forward and goes slack\").\n\nIn summary, the caption describes two isolated phenomena rather than the single, integrated action of a catapult launching a ball. This makes it fundamentally inaccurate and uninformative about the video's content.",
