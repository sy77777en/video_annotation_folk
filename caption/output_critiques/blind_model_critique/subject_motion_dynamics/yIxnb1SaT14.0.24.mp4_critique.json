  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. The caption incorrectly focuses on camera techniques, such as \"slow, smooth zoom-in\" and \"deep focus,\" rather than the motion of the subjects themselves, which is the primary instruction. The instructions specify that if the subject has no movement, this should be briefly mentioned. In this case, the main subjects—the basilica and the equestrian statue—are stationary, and the caption should have simply stated this. Furthermore, the description includes subjective (\"grand\") and appearance-based details (\"illuminated,\" \"green patina\") that the instructions advise against. A more effective caption would have omitted the cinematography terms and descriptive adjectives. For instance, I can imagine that while the main structures are static, perhaps a flag on one of the basilica's spires is fluttering in the night breeze, or faint clouds are drifting slowly across the sky behind it. Mentioning these subtle, secondary movements would have provided a more accurate and compliant description of the motion within the scene, rather than describing the camera's action.",
