    "pre_caption": "The video shows a figurine lying face-down on the ground, partially covered by wooden structures. The figurine is light-colored and initially visible from the knee up, with an arm extended outward. As the camera moves, the entire figure is revealed, showing it in a horizontal position. The wooden structures, which appear to be shelf-like, cover parts of the figurine, creating a layered effect. Scattered around the scene are small, colorful objects, adding texture to the setting. The focus remains on the figurine and its interaction with the surrounding elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a figurine lying in a prone position on the ground, partially obscured by wooden structures. The figurine is light-colored and initially visible from the knee up, with its right arm extended outward and the left hand turned outward. The left lower leg is slightly raised, with the left foot resting on a wooden structure, and the head is facing downward to the right. As the camera moves, the entire figure is revealed, showing it in a horizontal position. The wooden structures, which appear to be lattice-like, cover parts of the figurine, creating a layered effect. Scattered around the scene are small, colorful objects, adding texture to the setting. The focus remains on the figurine and the messy surroundings.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Violation of Core Instruction for Static Subjects:** The most significant issue is that the subject (the figurine) is static. The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption does the opposite; it is a lengthy, detailed paragraph describing a static scene, focusing on composition, appearance, and camera movement rather than the subject's lack of motion.\n\n*   **Incorrect Focus:** The instructions require a focus on the *subject's motion*. Since there is none, the caption should be very brief. Instead, it describes the camera's motion (\"As the camera moves\"), the subject's appearance (\"light-colored,\" \"visible from the knee up\"), and the arrangement of objects in the scene.\n\n*   **Use of Speculative and Abstract Language:** The caption violates the rules against using speculative and abstract descriptions.\n    *   It uses \"appear to be shelf-like,\" which is a speculative phrase explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n    *   It uses abstract descriptions like \"creating a layered effect,\" \"adding texture to the setting,\" and \"interaction with the surrounding elements,\" which do not describe concrete actions.\n\n*   **Inclusion of Unnecessary Detail:** The caption describes the figurine's color and the specific parts initially visible. According to the instructions, appearance details should only be used to differentiate between multiple subjects, which is not the case here.\n\nIn summary, the caption fundamentally misunderstands its primary goal. Instead of briefly stating the figurine is motionless as instructed, it provides a detailed visual analysis of a static scene, violating rules about conciseness, focus, and the use of forbidden language.",
