    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person, wearing a blue, white, and red helmet, a black chest protector featuring a colorful graffiti pattern on the back over a red and black long-sleeved jersey, red and black pants, and black boots, rides an orange and white dirt bike with a black seat. The rider, also wearing black gloves, is seen from the back and side as they navigate uneven, grassy terrain.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly follows the chronological order of events, it is somewhat repetitive and lacks specific, dynamic descriptions of the rider's technique. The phrases \"continues to move forward through the grassy and rocky terrain\" and \"navigating through the grassy and rocky landscape\" describe the same action and could be consolidated. The description of the jump is a bit clinical; a more vivid account might describe how the rider's body position shifts during takeoff or how the bike's suspension visibly compresses upon landing to absorb the impact. Furthermore, the caption states the rider \"adjusts their position slightly, leaning forward,\" but it misses a key detail: a rider on such terrain would likely be standing on the footpegs, using their legs as shock absorbers, which is a more specific and informative action to describe. The statement that the rider \"continues to control the throttle\" is an inference; it would be better to describe the observable result, such as the bike maintaining its speed through the air. Lastly, describing the turn as \"making a slight turn\" could be improved by detailing the action, such as \"leaning the bike into the right turn to navigate the corner.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The rider begins by accelerating on the dirt bike, maintaining a steady posture as they approach a small jump. As the bike lifts off the ground, the rider shifts their weight back, elevating the front wheel. The bike's suspension compresses visibly upon landing, absorbing the impact smoothly. The rider stands on the footpegs, using their legs as shock absorbers, and leans forward to maintain balance while navigating the grassy and rocky terrain. They skillfully maintain speed through the air and adjust their posture and throttle control to adapt to the uneven ground. As they approach a corner, the rider leans the bike into a right turn, expertly maneuvering through the landscape. Throughout the ride, the rider demonstrates precise control, making subtle adjustments to maintain a steady pace and balance across the challenging terrain.",
