    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features several stylized claymation figures with exaggerated facial features and elongated heads. The most prominent subject is a woman with pale skin, short brown hair with bangs, and a maroon beaded necklace, wearing a dark blue dress with a diamond pattern; she holds a small plate of food and has a serious expression. A man with light skin, short brown hair, and a somber face, dressed in a black suit and white shirt, stands beside her, also holding a plate of food. In the background, another woman with short dark hair and a dark dress is seen reading. An older man with a bald head and gray hair on the sides, wearing a green suit, initially positioned at the center, gradually shifts to the left as the camera moves. A framed portrait of a man with a long face and blue shirt, along with a vase of white flowers, is placed on a table. The small plate with a slice of cake and a candle beside the portrait is soon taken by the prominent woman, suggesting a commemorative setting. The characters’ faces are marked by visible brushstrokes and blush, giving them a handcrafted, textured appearance.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of motion. It precisely identifies the primary action (\"reaches forward to pick up a small plate\") while also correctly noting the lack of movement in other subjects (\"stands... without moving,\" \"remains seated... without changing position\").\n*   It accurately distinguishes between a subject's movement and the effect of camera motion by stating the man \"shifts to the left as the camera pans,\" which is a crucial and well-observed detail.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The description is comprehensive, accounting for the motion (or stillness) of all four salient subjects mentioned.\n*   It establishes a clear focal point—the woman in the blue dress—while still providing context by describing the secondary subjects and background elements.\n*   The inclusion of object interactions (\"holding a plate of food,\" \"pick up a small plate with a slice of cake\") adds necessary detail and completes the description of the action.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly presents the woman's actions in sequence: she \"stands holding... then reaches forward.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The entire paragraph is dedicated to describing movement and the deliberate lack thereof, avoiding unnecessary details about appearance except for differentiation (\"dark blue dress,\" \"black suit\").\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and direct. It forms a single, coherent paragraph as requested.\n*   **Specificity:** It uses specific verbs and descriptions (\"reaches forward to pick up,\" \"gradually shifts\") instead of generic terms.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids all emotional, subjective, or speculative language. The word \"rigid\" is used appropriately to describe a physical posture rather than an emotional state.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** It sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids interpreting the meaning or feeling of the movements.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is precise, detailed, objective, and well-structured, successfully capturing the essential motion of the scene.",
