    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person is shown wearing full motorcycle racing gear, including a blue and white helmet with green accents and a dark blue racing suit with black and white boots. They are riding a racing motorcycle that is primarily blue with red and white graphics. The motorcycle features various sponsor logos, including \"DELL Technologies\" and \"TRIUMPH,\" along with other logos that are indistinguishable. The bike has black wheels and is leaning sharply into a turn.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the subject's motion in a logical and physically plausible sequence. It correctly identifies the subject as a person on a racing motorcycle and the environment as a racetrack. The described actions—navigating a turn, leaning, and the front wheel lifting (a wheelie)—are common in motorcycle racing.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption effectively summarizes the most significant movements in the video. It captures the initial action (the turn) and the culminating action (the wheel lift) without getting bogged down in minor details, providing a complete picture of the event.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels here. It first describes the motorcycle navigating the turn and leaning, and then describes the subsequent action of the front wheel lifting as it continues through the turn. The actions are presented in the precise order they occur.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on motion, using specific verbs and adverbs: \"navigates a left-hand turn,\" \"leaning sharply,\" \"continues through the turn,\" \"moves closer,\" and \"lifts off the pavement.\"\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, direct, and easy to understand. It forms a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"amazing,\" \"skillful\") and speculative phrases (\"it appears to,\" \"might be\"). \"Sharply\" is a descriptive adverb that quantifies the lean, not an emotional one.\n*   **Specificity:** It provides specific details about the motion (\"navigates a left-hand turn,\" \"front wheel lifts off the pavement\") rather than a generic description like \"a motorcycle drives fast.\"",
