  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows what is described, the caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a coastline, the presence of large waves crashing against rocks, and a flock of birds flying in the sky.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption describes the two primary sources of motion in the scene: the waves and the birds. It provides a good overview of the main actions. Without viewing the video, it is impossible to say if any other subtle motions are missed, but it appears to capture the most salient movements.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption follows some instructions well but violates others.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Describes Motion:** It uses specific action verbs to describe the motion of the waves (\"crash against\") and the birds (\"flying in formation\"), adhering to the instruction to specify how subjects move.\n*   **Group Activity:** The description \"a flock of birds can be seen flying in formation\" correctly follows the instruction to describe group activities with specificity.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is generally simple and clear, forming a coherent paragraph.\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** It does not use speculative words like \"might\" or \"appears.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to the instructions:**\n*   **Avoids Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses the word \"imposing\" to describe the rock formations. \"Imposing\" is a subjective adjective that describes a feeling or impression, which the instructions explicitly forbid.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption spends significant space describing the static scenery (\"rugged coastline,\" \"clear, sunny day,\" \"dark... rock formations,\" \"turquoise ocean,\" \"bright blue sky\") rather than focusing primarily on the motion. The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"This is a scenic shot of...\", which is introductory text that should be avoided. The instructions ask for the description itself, not a label for the video type.\n*   **Directness:** The phrase \"can be seen flying\" is less direct and active than simply stating \"A flock of birds flies...\" The instructions favor clear, direct descriptions.",
