  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption accurately identifies that the video is a static shot with no movement.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption correctly fulfills the requirement for a video with no movement by stating that the camera is still and the shot is static.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the following instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption fails this by dedicating most of its text to describing the sign's content (\"informational sign for an Indian Rhinoceros,\" \"in multiple languages, including Japanese and English\") and its location (\"at a zoo,\" \"in front of... the animal's enclosure\"). These are details about the subject and setting, not motion.\n*   **Avoid Speculation:** The caption uses the phrase \"what appears to be,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\"\n*   **Brevity for Static Shots:** For videos with no movement, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The provided caption is not brief; it adds unnecessary descriptive details about the sign and its surroundings. A correct caption would simply state that the subject is stationary.\n*   **Avoid Introductory Text:** The phrase \"This is a static shot of...\" is an unnecessary introductory statement. The description should be direct.",
