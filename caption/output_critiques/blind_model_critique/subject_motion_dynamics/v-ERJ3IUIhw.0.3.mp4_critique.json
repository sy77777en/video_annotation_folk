    "pre_caption": "This video shows a time-lapse of a blue pencil sketch being created on a white background. The drawing begins as a simple outline of a head and is progressively refined and detailed. Lines are drawn, erased, and redrawn to form the final portrait of a woman, with features, hair, accessories, and clothing appearing sequentially until the sketch is complete.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video showcases the stop-motion animation of a blue pencil sketch of a woman on a white background. The drawing evolves from a dish to a detailed portrait. The completed sketch depicts a woman with dark hair styled in an updo, accessorized with a flower-like pin on one side and a barrette on the other. She has almond-shaped eyes, a neutral expression, and is wearing a high-collared garment with a traditional knot fastening at the neck.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological progression of the drawing's creation but omits the primary moving subject, which would likely be the artist's hand and the blue pencil. Instead of passively stating that \"lines being drawn, erased, and redrawn,\" the description should actively describe the hand's motion as it guides the pencil to form lines, uses an eraser to remove specific marks, and then redraws them. The initial action involving the dish is unclear; a more precise description would be to state that a hand places a dish onto the paper, traces its edge, then flips the dish to trace the other side, forming the head's initial outline. Furthermore, the phrase \"Features, hair, accessories, and clothing appear sequentially\" is too general. A better description would specify the order of creation, such as, \"The hand then sketches the eyes and nose, adds shading to the cheeks, draws individual strands of hair, and finally details an earring and the collar of a shirt,\" which provides a more vivid account of the stop-motion process.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a time-lapse of a blue pencil sketch being created on a white background, focusing on the dynamic movement of the artist's hand and pencil. The process begins with a hand placing a dish onto the paper, tracing its edge, then flipping the dish to trace the other side, forming the initial outline of a head. The hand skillfully guides the pencil to draw, erase, and redraw lines, gradually refining the portrait. The sequence unfolds as the hand sketches the eyes and nose, adds shading to the cheeks, draws individual strands of hair, and finally details an earring and the collar of a shirt, bringing the portrait of a woman to life.",
