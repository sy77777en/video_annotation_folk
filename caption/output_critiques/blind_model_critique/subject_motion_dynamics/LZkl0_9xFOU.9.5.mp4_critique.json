    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young man with short, dark brown hair and a light complexion is sitting on a bench. He wears a grey t-shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers. He is focused on a black laptop resting on his lap, with both hands on the keyboard as if typing. The characters in the video appear faceless, resembling animated or stylized 3D models. In the background, there is a crowd of black, featureless human figures standing behind a metal barrier.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies that the primary subject and background figures are largely stationary, but it oversimplifies the scene by describing them as \"motionless\" and \"completely still,\" which is likely inaccurate for a video. In the video, the young man, while focused, exhibits subtle movements such as blinking and the slight rise and fall of his chest as he breathes. His fingers might also twitch slightly above the keyboard, suggesting paused thought rather than total inactivity. Furthermore, the caption completely omits the motion in the environment; for instance, the leaves on the trees behind the bench could be rustling in the wind, and reflections of passing clouds might be shifting across the laptop screen. A more accurate description would capture these nuanced, minimal movements, such as \"The young man sits on a bench, his gaze fixed on his laptop, with his body remaining still aside from occasional blinks. In the background, other figures stand stationary as leaves on the trees behind them sway in the breeze,\" providing a more faithful and detailed account of the visual information.",
