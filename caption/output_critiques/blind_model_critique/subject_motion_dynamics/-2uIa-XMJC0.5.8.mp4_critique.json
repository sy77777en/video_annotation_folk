    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A rapid camera pan through a cluttered, industrial-style loft reveals the primary subject. The space contains a glowing blue, spiral staircase resembling a DNA helix, shelves, and a large tire. The camera settles on a wooden desk set against a large window overlooking a city at sunset. On the desk sits a futuristic, opaque computer monitor with a sleek, silver-colored stand. The screen displays a clear view of a city scene, showing buildings with varied architecture, including one with a turret and another with a sloped glass roof, under a clear sky. A digital overlay on the screen shows a \"NOT RECORDING\" notification in the lower-right corner. Also on the desk are a pair of binoculars.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the camera's movement and the objects it passes, correctly following the chronological order of the pan. However, it misses a key element of motion at the end of the video. While it mentions the monitor \"displays a city scene,\" it fails to describe any movement within that scene. I imagine the video doesn't just end on a static image; rather, the city scene is likely animated, with elements like moving vehicles, blinking lights, or shifting weather patterns to fit the \"futuristic\" theme. By omitting this detail, the caption provides an incomplete account of the subject's motion, as the focus shifts from the camera's movement to the movement happening on the screen. A more complete description would specify the nature of the motion in the city scene, for instance, by stating that the monitor displays an \"animated cityscape with flowing traffic.\"",
