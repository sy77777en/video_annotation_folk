    "pre_caption": "The video shows a gray sedan parked on a street with a license plate reading 'KNC 761'. The car's rear window reflects the surrounding environment, including trees and buildings. Inside the car, a person wearing a dark beanie and a light-colored jacket is seated in the back seat, with their arm resting on the window frame. The person appears to be looking forward throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a gray sedan with a sleek, angular design, characterized by its reflective surface and distinctive rear window shape. The car is parked on a street, and its rear license plate is visible. The vehicle's windows are slightly tinted, and the roof has a sunroof feature. Inside the car, an individual wearing a light-colored hat and jacket is seated in the back seat, facing forward. In the front right seat, a person wearing a dark beanie is turning their head towards the back. The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and a sidewalk visible nearby.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption focuses excessively on static descriptions, such as the car's license plate and the subjects' clothing, while failing to adequately describe their motion as instructed. The video I watched shows a clear interaction, but the caption reduces this to a single, vague action and uses speculative language like \"appears to be\" and \"seemingly engaged,\" which should be avoided. It misses the chronological sequence of the interaction: the person in the front passenger seat first turns their head over their right shoulder to face the back, and only then does the person in the back seat, who was initially looking forward, turn their head to the left to engage with them. The caption also omits that the person in the front gestures with their right hand while speaking and that the person in the back nods in response. A better description would chronologically detail this turn-based interaction, describing the specific head turns and gestures of both individuals rather than interpreting their actions as a \"conversation.\"",
