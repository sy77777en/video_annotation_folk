    "pre_caption": "The video shows a gray sedan parked on a street with a license plate reading 'KNC 761'. The car's rear window reflects the surrounding environment, including trees and buildings. Inside the car, a person wearing a dark beanie and a light-colored jacket is seated in the back seat, with their arm resting on the window frame. The person appears to be looking forward throughout the sequence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a gray sedan with a sleek, angular design, characterized by its reflective surface and distinctive rear window shape. The car is parked on a street, and its rear license plate is visible. The vehicle's windows are slightly tinted, and the roof has a sunroof feature. Inside the car, an individual wearing a light-colored hat and jacket is seated in the back seat, facing forward. In the front right seat, a person wearing a dark beanie is turning their head towards the back. The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and a sidewalk visible nearby.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is mostly accurate in its description of the static scene. It correctly identifies a gray sedan, a license plate, reflections, and a person inside. However, it violates the instruction to avoid uncertain statements by using the phrase \"The person appears to be looking forward,\" which introduces speculation.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is overly complete. The instructions state to focus on motion and avoid repeating details that would be in other descriptions. By including the car's color, the specific license plate number, the nature of the reflections, and the person's clothing, the caption provides an excessive amount of static detail rather than a concise summary of the (lack of) action.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption does not adhere well to the instructions for the following reasons:\n\n1.  **Focus on Static Details:** The primary instruction is to describe the subject's **motion**. For a static video, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption does the opposite, focusing almost entirely on static visual details (license plate, reflections, clothing) instead of simply stating that the subjects are stationary.\n2.  **Use of Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly says to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options.\" The caption violates this rule by using the phrase \"appears to be.\"\n3.  **Lack of Conciseness:** The caption is not concise. A better caption following the rules would be a single, brief sentence. For example: \"A person sits stationary in the back seat of a parked gray sedan.\" This conveys the core information (no movement) without unnecessary detail.",
