    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a high-angle, extreme wide perspective, a large crowd of people populates a waterside plaza. The individuals are indistinct but are collectively seen wearing a variety of colorful casual attire in shades of red, blue, green, and white. Along the waterfront, numerous long, slender, blue gondolas are docked side-by-side. A single black gondola carrying several people moves across the water. A figure, the gondolier, stands at the stern, propelling the boat forward, while a few passengers are seated in the main body of the vessel.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the primary subject and its direction of travel, but it lacks specificity regarding the actual motions involved. The description of the crowd as simply \"walks in various directions\" is too generic for a \"bustling\" scene; the video likely shows a more varied set of actions, such as people standing in groups, leaning on the balustrade to watch the water, and taking photos, which are all distinct from walking. The most critical omission is in describing the main action: the word \"propelled\" is vague and fails to capture the unique and visible technique of the gondolier. The video would clearly show the gondolier standing at the stern and using a single, long oar in a distinct rowing motion to guide the vessel. A more accurate description would be \"a gondolier rows from the stern with a long oar,\" which specifies the action that creates the movement. Additionally, the passengers are described as \"seated,\" but the video might show them actively looking around or taking pictures, which adds a layer of secondary motion to the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a bustling waterside plaza, a diverse crowd engages in various activities: some stand in groups, others lean on the balustrade to watch the water, and many take photos. Numerous blue gondolas remain docked along the waterfront, bobbing gently on the water. Meanwhile, a single black gondola carrying passengers who are actively looking around and taking pictures is rowed across the water from right to left by a gondolier standing at the stern, skillfully using a long oar in a distinct rowing motion.",
