    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person's light-skinned hand holds a dark blue smartphone steady. The phone has a vertical camera array with three distinct lenses, each surrounded by a ridged, black metallic ring. The sharp, silver blade of a utility knife is pressed against the metallic ring border surrounding the middle camera lens, with visible scratch marks at the point of contact.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (utility knife, smartphone, hand) and precisely describes the action of the knife being \"repeatedly scraped back and forth\" across the camera's metallic ring. It also accurately notes the result of this action: \"creating visible marks on the ring's surface.\"\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It captures all the essential motion in the video. It describes the primary action (the scraping of the knife) and the secondary action (the hand holding the phone steady), providing a full picture of the event. It also specifies the effect of the interaction, which adds important context.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all the given instructions:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It centers the description on the \"scraping motion,\" describing it as \"repeatedly scraped back and forth\" and \"short and quick.\"\n*   **Chronological Order:** The action is repetitive, and the caption correctly describes it as a continuous \"back and forth\" motion.\n*   **Specificity:** It excels in specificity. Instead of \"a person damages a phone,\" it details that \"a utility knife is repeatedly scraped,\" specifying the exact interaction and its effect (\"creating visible marks\"), as instructed.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely objective, using factual language and avoiding any emotional, subjective, or speculative words (e.g., \"aggressively,\" \"it seems to be\").\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The description is written in simple, natural English, forming a clear and coherent paragraph without unnecessary words.\n*   **Format:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, detailed, and perfectly aligned with the requirements.",
