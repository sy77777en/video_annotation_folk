  "generated_critique": "Your caption correctly identifies the setting, subject, and camera movement, but it relies on subjective and abstract language instead of describing the specific motions of the storm itself. The words \"dramatic\" and \"powerful,\" along with the phrase \"capturing the dynamic nature,\" are interpretive rather than descriptive. The caption misses key opportunities to detail the storm's movement, which would likely be the video's main focus. For instance, the video probably shows the dark clouds churning or rolling across the sky, not just filling it. There might be frequent flashes of lightning within the clouds or forking down to the mountains, which is a critical motion to include. Furthermore, the \"sheets of rain\" could be described as actively sweeping or drifting across the landscape as the camera pans, rather than just \"falling.\" A better description would omit the subjective adjectives and instead detail these specific actions, such as \"Dark clouds churn from right to left as the camera pans, while intermittent lightning flashes. In the distance, sheets of rain sweep across the mountains.\" This focuses purely on the observable motion.",
