    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a distant view of a shirtless person standing with their back to the camera, set against a dark, indistinct background. The camera gradually moves closer, revealing more details of the person's back and shoulders. The person remains stationary throughout the video, and the background remains consistently dark and unclear.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person with a bare torso, viewed from behind, slightly tilting their head downward. The individual has short, thinning dark hair, a light skin tone, and a slender physique. Initially, the person occupies a smaller portion of the frame, with a significant part obscured by a black wall. As the video progresses, the obstruction diminishes, revealing more of the indoor setting and settling on a medium shot of the person. The focus remains on the upper body, highlighting the person's back and shoulders.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but could be improved to better align with the core instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the visual content of the video: a stationary person is shown, and the camera moves closer to them. It correctly identifies that the subject does not move.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption completely covers the events in the video from start to finish. It establishes the initial scene, describes the primary action (the camera moving), and confirms the subject's state throughout.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nHere is a breakdown of how the caption adheres to the specific rules:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the events in sequence (\"The video begins with...\", \"The camera gradually moves closer...\").\n*   **No Speculation or Ambiguity:** It describes only what is visible and avoids words like \"appears\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Simple and Objective:** The language is natural, clear, and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   **Handles \"No Movement\":** It explicitly and correctly states, \"The person remains stationary throughout the video,\" following the instruction for static subjects.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n\n**Where the caption can be improved:**\n*   **Focus on Subject's Motion:** The primary weakness is its focus on the **camera's motion** (\"The camera gradually moves closer\") rather than exclusively on the **subject's motion**. The instructions are very specific: \"**Focus on the subject's motion** rather than repeating details...\" Since the subject is stationary, the description of the camera's movement, while accurate, distracts from the main directive. The core piece of information required by the instructions is simply that the subject does not move.\n*   **Inclusion of Descriptive Details:** The caption includes details like \"shirtless person,\" \"back to the camera,\" and \"dark, indistinct background.\" The instructions state to \"avoid repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" While some context is necessary, the current caption dedicates significant space to these static details instead of being a concise statement about the subject's lack of movement.\n\n**In summary, the caption is well-written and accurate, but it deviates from the main instruction to focus strictly on the subject's motion. A more compliant caption would be more concise and centered entirely on the fact that the person is stationary.**",
