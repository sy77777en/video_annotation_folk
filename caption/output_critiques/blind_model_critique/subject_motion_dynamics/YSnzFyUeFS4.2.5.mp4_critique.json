    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a tattooed arm raises a black camera into the frame, aiming it toward a street scene. As the camera is held in position, a woman walks along the sidewalk toward the camera. In the background, a person rides a bicycle down the street, moving from right to left. The people seated at the outdoor tables remain relatively still.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective, a light-skinned arm with a large, dark tattoo on the forearm holds a black camera, pointing it toward a street scene. On the right, a man with short, dark hair wearing a blue polo shirt and a woman with dark, shoulder-length hair in a patterned dress are seated facing each other at a small outdoor table, eating. Back-to-back with the woman with dark, shoulder-length hair, another woman with long, brown hair in a blue denim jacket sits at a separate table, looking at her phone. Walking on the sidewalk toward the camera is a woman with long, blonde hair, wearing a blue top and jeans. To the left, a black motorcycle is parked on the street adjacent to the sidewalk next to a large tree, and a silver and black fire hydrant is visible in the foreground.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly establishes the first-person perspective and the chronological order of the main action, but it falters by using vague descriptions for the background subjects. The phrase \"display some hand movements\" is too generic; the video likely shows more specific actions, such as people lifting coffee cups to their mouths, gesturing during a conversation, or scrolling on their phones, which should be described. Similarly, the description of the cyclist moving \"from the middle ground to the background\" is awkwardly phrased and could be more clearly stated as \"rides down the street, moving away from the camera.\" The caption also misses an opportunity to clarify the relationship between the camera and the approaching woman; it is unclear if she is the intended subject of the photograph or simply a passerby walking through the scene. Finally, the initial action of raising the camera could be more descriptive—for example, specifying if the camera is brought up slowly and deliberately to eye-level or held at the waist, which would provide more insight into the photographer's intent.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person perspective, a tattooed arm slowly raises a black camera to eye level, aiming it toward a street scene. As the camera is held in position, a woman walks along the sidewalk toward the camera, possibly as the intended subject of the photograph. In the background, a person rides a bicycle down the street, moving away from the camera. Meanwhile, people seated at outdoor tables engage in specific actions, such as lifting coffee cups to their mouths, gesturing during conversations, or scrolling on their phones.",
