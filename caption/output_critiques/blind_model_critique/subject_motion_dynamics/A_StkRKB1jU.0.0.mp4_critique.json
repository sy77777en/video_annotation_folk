  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. It fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The caption uses the phrase \"creating a dramatic effect,\" which is a subjective and emotional description. The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n\n*   **Lack of Specificity in Motion:** The caption states that \"a glass window shatters,\" but it does not describe the motion itself. The instructions require specifying *how* the subject moves (e.g., \"a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement\"). A better description would detail the motion of the glass, such as \"a glass window shatters, sending fragments exploding outward and downward.\"\n\n*   **Incorrect Focus:** The first sentence, \"The video features a cityscape with tall buildings and a rooftop view,\" describes the static scenery. The instructions clearly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The primary focus should be the action, not the setting.\n\n*   **Weak Chronological Description:** The phrase \"There is a moment where...\" is a weak way to describe the action. The instructions ask for actions to be presented in chronological order. A more direct description of the event as it happens would be more effective and compliant.",
