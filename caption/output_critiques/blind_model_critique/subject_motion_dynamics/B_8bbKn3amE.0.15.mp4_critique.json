  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly focuses on the camera's movement as the primary action, which is a meta-description of the cinematography rather than a description of the subjects' motion as instructed. While the camera's path is a key element, the caption fails to describe the motion of any subjects within the scene itself. For instance, the turquoise water is not static; it is visibly rippling from a light wind, with the ripples moving from right to left across the frame. Additionally, several small icebergs are drifting slowly with the current toward the far end of the lake. The caption also uses subjective adjectives like \"vibrant\" and \"stunning,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions. A better approach would be to describe the motion of the water and icebergs first, and then describe how the camera's forward glide over the lake's surface brings the glacier-topped mountain into a more prominent view.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The turquoise glacial lake is animated by gentle ripples moving from right to left, stirred by a light wind. Several small icebergs drift slowly with the current toward the far end of the lake. The camera glides forward just above the water's surface, gradually revealing a massive, rocky mountain in the background topped with a thick glacier.",
