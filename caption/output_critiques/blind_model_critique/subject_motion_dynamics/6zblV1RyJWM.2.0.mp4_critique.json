    "pre_caption": "The video captures a close-up of an elephant's face and upper body, with the background showing a dry, hilly landscape. The elephant's head and trunk are the main focus, with its large ears and tusks clearly visible. The elephant's eyes and the texture of its skin are detailed, highlighting its calm and composed demeanor. The background remains consistent, with the dry, hilly terrain providing a natural setting for the elephant.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large African elephant prominently in the foreground. The elephant has a textured, gray skin with visible wrinkles and large, fan-like ears. Its tusks are long and curved, with a slightly worn appearance. The elephant's trunk is thick and muscular, hanging down in front of its face. Its eyes are small and dark, set beneath a prominent brow. The elephant is facing forward, occupying most of the frame, showcasing its massive size and distinctive features.**",

  "generated_critique": "This caption fails to describe the subject's motion, which is the primary instruction. Instead, it focuses entirely on the static appearance of the elephant and the background, details that should be secondary to its actions. The use of subjective language like \"calm and composed demeanor\" is an interpretation of the elephant's emotional state and should be avoided. Assuming the video shows movement, the caption should have detailed these actions chronologically. For example, it could have described how the elephant rhythmically flaps its large ears back and forth to cool itself, or how it slowly raises its trunk, curls the tip to sniff the air, and then lowers it to the ground. A more effective caption would focus on these specific movements, such as: \"The elephant stands in place, swaying its head gently from side to side while continuously flapping its ears. It then raises its trunk, curling the tip inward before lowering it out of view.\"",
