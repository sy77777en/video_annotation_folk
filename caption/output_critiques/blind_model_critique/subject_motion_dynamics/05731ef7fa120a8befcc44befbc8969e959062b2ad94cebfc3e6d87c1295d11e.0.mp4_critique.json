    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blank white background. Yellow ink appears from the left and right sides, moving towards the center. The two clusters of yellow ink continue to expand and merge as they approach each other. The ink forms a larger, more cohesive mass, with the yellow color becoming more prominent and the shapes more defined. The ink continues to spread and blend, creating a dense, vibrant cloud. The video concludes with the yellow ink fully merged, forming a large, intricate cloud-like shape against the white background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a dynamic display of vibrant yellow ink swirling and expanding in a fluid medium. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like patterns with soft, rounded edges, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The shapes continuously evolve, with the yellow hues varying in intensity, giving a rich, textured appearance. The overall effect is abstract, with the ink appearing to float and merge, creating a visually striking and fluid composition.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately outlines the chronological sequence of events, but it lacks the specific motion details needed to paint a clear picture of the action. The description relies on general verbs like \"appears,\" \"moving,\" and \"expand,\" which don't capture the fluid quality of the ink. For instance, instead of the ink just \"appearing,\" a more precise description might be that it \"bleeds in from the left and right edges\" or \"flows inward in two distinct streams.\" The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the texture of the movement; it could specify if the ink spreads with fine, branching tendrils or in soft, billowing plumes. Furthermore, the description of the merge is vague; rather than simply \"blending,\" the caption could describe how the two masses \"swirl together, creating eddies and whorls as they combine.\" Finally, the use of subjective adjectives like \"vibrant\" and \"intricate\" should be replaced with objective descriptions of the visual facts, such as describing the final shape as having \"complex, feathered edges and variations in color density\" instead of just calling it \"intricate.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a blank white background. Yellow ink bleeds in from the left and right edges, flowing inward in two distinct streams. As the streams approach each other, they spread with fine, branching tendrils, creating a dynamic, fluid motion. The two clusters of yellow ink swirl together, forming eddies and whorls as they merge into a larger mass. The yellow color becomes more pronounced, and the shapes take on a more defined form. The ink continues to spread, creating a dense cloud with complex, feathered edges and variations in color density. The video concludes with the yellow ink fully merged, forming a large, cloud-like shape against the white background.",
