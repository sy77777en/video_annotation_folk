    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a furry bear toy sitting on a carpeted floor, surrounded by miniature toys and scattered papers. A person wearing striped clothes enters the scene, visible from the waist down, moving on their knees. They pull a covered rack draped in white fabric into view and lift the fabric, revealing the lower base of a steel Ferris wheel structure. The Ferris wheel is illuminated by a warm, glowing light in the background. The person then exits the frame, leaving the bear toy facing the now fully visible Ferris wheel.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows the sequence of events as they would occur. It starts with the hand entering, describes the action of pulling the cover, notes the result of that action (revealing the Ferris wheel), and concludes with the hand exiting and the final static scene. This is a clear, logical, and chronological account of the motion.\n\n*   **Focus on Motion and Specificity:** The caption excels at describing motion with precision. Instead of saying \"a cover is removed,\" it specifies \"A hand enters from the right and pulls a white fabric cover upward and out of the frame.\" This is a clear, specific description of the action, subject, and object interaction, as requested by the instructions.\n\n*   **Completeness:** It describes the entire motion from beginning to end. It not only covers the action but also correctly describes the final state where the subjects become \"motionless\" and \"stationary,\" providing a complete picture of the video's content.\n\n*   **Adherence to Negative Constraints:**\n    *   **No Subjective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective words (e.g., \"gently,\" \"beautifully\"). It uses objective descriptors like \"white,\" \"miniature,\" and \"metal.\"\n    *   **No Speculation:** It makes no assumptions or use of ambiguous phrases like \"it appears\" or \"might be.\"\n    *   **No Abstract Descriptions:** It sticks to concrete, physical actions rather than abstract interpretations like \"creating a sense of wonder.\"\n\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It forms a coherent paragraph that is informative without being overly wordy. It successfully describes the main action (the hand revealing the object) while also including the relevant secondary subject (the bear toy).",
