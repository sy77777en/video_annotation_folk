  "generated_critique": "The provided caption describes a static scene rather than the subject's motion as instructed. It focuses on what the lightning illuminates instead of describing the movement of the storm itself. The phrase \"flashes of lightning\" is too generic; a more effective description would specify the types and sequence of motion, such as \"diffuse sheet lightning first flashes within the clouds, followed by a bright, forked bolt that strikes the canyon floor.\" The term \"swirling\" for the storm clouds is vague; the caption should clarify if the clouds are moving across the frame or churning in place. Furthermore, the phrase \"what appears to be a heavy downpour\" is speculative and should be removed. If rain is visible, its motion should be described factually, such as \"streaks of rain fall vertically.\" Lastly, the caption lacks a clear chronological order of events, instead listing static elements, and uses subjective adjectives like \"dramatic\" and \"powerful,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions of the storm's actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a nighttime lightning storm moving across a vast canyon. Diffuse sheet lightning first flashes within the clouds, followed by a bright, forked bolt that strikes the canyon floor. The storm clouds churn in place, while streaks of rain fall vertically. The electrical display unfolds against a backdrop of a star-filled night sky, highlighting the dynamic movement of the storm.",
