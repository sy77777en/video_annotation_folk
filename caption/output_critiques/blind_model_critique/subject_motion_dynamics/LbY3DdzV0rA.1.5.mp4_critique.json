  "generated_critique": "The feedback is:\nThe caption correctly identifies the core subject—a time-lapse of a storm—but it misses key motional details that would likely be prominent in such a video. The use of the subjective adjective \"dramatic\" and the introductory phrase \"This is a... video of\" should be omitted to adhere to the instructions. A more significant omission is the description of light and shadow; in a time-lapse over the Grand Canyon, the fast-moving clouds would cause shadows to race across the canyon's complex topography, a primary form of motion that is not mentioned. The caption also lacks a clear chronological progression. For instance, it doesn't specify if the clouds gather from a particular direction before the rain begins, or how the storm system as a whole traverses the frame from one side to the other. Finally, while it mentions \"sheets of rain,\" it could be more specific about their movement, such as describing them as vertical shafts that appear and dissipate or as curtains of precipitation being driven horizontally by wind across the canyon. If lightning were present, which is common in such storms, its flashes would be a critical, instantaneous motion to include.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A time-lapse captures a storm sweeping over the Grand Canyon, with heavy, dark clouds rolling rapidly from the west. Shadows race across the canyon's intricate landscape as the clouds move, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. Vertical shafts of rain appear and dissipate, driven horizontally by the wind across the vast expanse. Occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the scene, adding bursts of energy to the unfolding drama.",
