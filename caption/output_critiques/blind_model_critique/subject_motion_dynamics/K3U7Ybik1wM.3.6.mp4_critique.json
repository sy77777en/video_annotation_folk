  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately identifies the video as a \"static scenery shot\" and correctly describes the visible elements of the room (attic bedroom, sloped ceiling, beams, skylight, bed, desk, chair).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete in that it correctly identifies that there is no motion in the video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The instruction states, \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses the word \"cozy,\" which is a subjective description of the room's atmosphere.\n*   **Violation of Conciseness for Static Shots:** The instruction specifies, \"If the video is a scenery shot without salient subjects, you do not need to describe subject motion. Instead, briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" and \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The provided caption is overly descriptive for a static shot. Instead of briefly noting the lack of movement, it goes into a detailed inventory of the room's features, which is unnecessary.\n*   **Violation of Focus:** The instructions emphasize focusing on motion and avoiding \"repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" By describing the room's contents in detail, the caption focuses on appearance rather than the state of motion (or lack thereof).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **not good**. While it correctly identifies the scene as static, it violates the core instructions by including a subjective adjective (\"cozy\") and providing excessive, unnecessary detail about the room's appearance instead of briefly stating that there is no movement. A better caption, following the rules, would be something like: \"This is a static shot of an attic bedroom with no movement.\"",
