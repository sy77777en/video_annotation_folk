  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to the core instructions. While it accurately describes the visual content and the camera's movement, it fundamentally misunderstands the primary goal of the task.\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a static scene and the camera's motion. It correctly identifies the objects (cars, houses, shop) and their state (parked).\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete in describing the static visual elements of the scene. However, it is incomplete in describing the *subject's motion* because there is none.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation of Core Instruction:** The main instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" The subjects in this video (cars, houses) are static. The caption instead describes the *camera's motion* (\"The camera slowly pans to the left\") and provides a detailed inventory of the static scene. The instructions are explicit about describing the movement of subjects within the frame, not the movement of the camera itself.\n*   **Violation of \"No Movement\" Rule:** The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption does the opposite. It goes into extensive detail about a scene with no subject movement.\n*   **Violation of Conciseness and Focus:** The caption includes many details that are not related to motion, such as \"a house with a blue and beige exterior,\" \"a small shop or building with a white sign and some plants outside,\" and \"utility poles and wires.\" This violates the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" These descriptive details belong in a subject description, not a motion caption.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nFollowing the instructions, a good caption for this video would be:\n\nThe video shows a static street scene with parked cars and houses. The camera pans slowly to the left across the scene.",
