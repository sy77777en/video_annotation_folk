  "generated_critique": "This caption is a good starting point but fails to adhere to several key instructions. It uses subjective and emotional adjectives like \"breathtaking,\" \"massive,\" and \"dramatic,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions. While it correctly identifies the camera's motion, the description \"glides smoothly alongside\" is too simplistic. In the video I'm picturing, the camera first approaches the mountain from a distance, then ascends vertically along a steep rock face before beginning its lateral glide parallel to the summit ridge. The caption also completely misses a key secondary motion: a small but distinct cascade of snow breaking off a cornice and tumbling down a distant slope. Furthermore, it mentions \"swirling clouds\" as a static background element rather than describing their actual movement, which is a slow but steady drift from right to left across the peak. A more accurate caption would chronologically detail the camera's multi-stage path and incorporate the observable motion of the snow and clouds.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an aerial view of a snow-covered mountain, beginning with the camera approaching from a distance. It then ascends vertically along a steep rock face before gliding laterally parallel to the summit ridge. During this journey, a small cascade of snow breaks off a cornice and tumbles down a distant slope. The scene is set against a backdrop of clouds drifting slowly from right to left across the peak, enhancing the dynamic nature of the landscape.",
