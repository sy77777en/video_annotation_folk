    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a world map where several locations in North America and South America are highlighted with blue squares. The blue squares then disappear, and a yellow curved line starts to form, connecting a point in Europe to Uruguay. The yellow line continues to extend, eventually reaching Uruguay, which is highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text. The video concludes with a clear view of Uruguay, emphasizing the connection between Europe and Uruguay through the yellow line.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video presents a world map with various regions highlighted. Initially, several locations across North America and South America are marked with blue squares. A yellow curved line then appears, directly connecting a point in Europe to Uruguay, crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The focus shifts to Uruguay, where the country is distinctly highlighted in light blue and labeled with white text. This sequence suggests a journey or connection between Europe and Uruguay. The map's design uses dark tones for continents, drawing attention to the specified regions and routes.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (world map, highlights, line), their attributes (blue squares, yellow curved line, light blue highlight), and the geographic locations involved (North America, South America, Europe, Uruguay). The sequence of events described is also factually correct according to the description.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It covers the entire sequence of motion from the beginning to the end of the video without leaving out any significant actions. It describes the initial state (blue squares), the transition (squares disappear, line forms), the main action (line extends), and the final state (Uruguay is highlighted with the line connected).\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but there is one area for improvement.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption is perfectly structured in chronological order, using words like \"begins with,\" \"then,\" and \"concludes with\" to guide the reader through the sequence of events.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It effectively uses action-oriented verbs to describe the motion: \"are highlighted,\" \"disappear,\" \"starts to form,\" \"connecting,\" \"continues to extend,\" \"reaching.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is succinct while providing all the essential details of the on-screen action.\n*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n*   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n*   **Specificity:** It is specific about the actions, such as the line \"forming\" and \"extending,\" rather than just stating it \"appears.\"\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n*   **Avoid Abstract Descriptions:** The final phrase, \"...emphasizing the connection between Europe and Uruguay through the yellow line,\" violates the instruction to \"Avoid abstract descriptions.\" This part of the sentence describes the *purpose* or *meaning* of the visual, similar to the forbidden example \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\" A better approach would be to describe the final visual state literally.\n\n**Revised Example (for illustration):**\nA more compliant version of the last sentence would be: \"The video concludes with the completed yellow line shown connecting Europe to Uruguay, which remains highlighted and labeled.\" This revision describes what is visually present without interpreting its meaning.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good and follows almost all instructions precisely. Its only flaw is the inclusion of an abstract, interpretive phrase at the end. With a minor adjustment to that final clause, it would be a perfect example of the desired output.",
