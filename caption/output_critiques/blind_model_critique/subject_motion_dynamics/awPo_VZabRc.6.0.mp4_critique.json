As she moves, an older man in a cap walks from right to left, passing in front of her. The woman continues her path, walking past a man in a red cap who remains mostly stationary in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of this animated video is a young woman with light skin and black hair styled in an updo, seen walking in profile from left to right. She wears a pink short-sleeved t-shirt, dark pants, and carries a light blue backpack over her right shoulder. To her right stands a woman with long blonde hair, wearing a light purple t-shirt and a white apron. In the foreground, seen from left to right, is a woman with an afro hairstyle wearing sunglasses, a man with reddish-brown hair wearing a brown jacket and a red baseball cap, and an older man with a prominent nose, wearing a dark blue cap and a grey jacket.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological flow of events, but it could be more precise in its spatial descriptions and the relationship between the subjects' actions. The term \"animated\" is subjective; a more objective description of her movements, such as \"gesturing with her hands as she walks\" or \"looking around the room expressively,\" would be more informative. The placement of the stationary people \"in the foreground\" seems unlikely if the main subject is walking \"past\" them; it's more probable they are seated at tables in the mid-ground, and the main subject walks along an aisle. The description of the blonde woman's motion is fragmented; it would be clearer to state that she overtakes the main subject, walks to a nearby table, throws a menu down without stopping, and then exits the frame. The caption also creates ambiguity by stating the blonde woman reaches \"the assigned table\" while the main subject reaches \"her assigned table,\" which could imply they are going to the same place. Clarifying that they approach separate tables would resolve this. Finally, the description of the main subject's final action feels incomplete; specifying whether she then sits down or if the video ends as she places the backpack would provide a more definitive conclusion to her movement.",
