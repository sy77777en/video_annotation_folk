    "pre_caption": "The camera begins with a low-angle, close-up view of a spike strip on the ground. It then slowly pulls backward and pans slightly to the left, moving along a fortified border. This motion reveals a tall concrete wall on the right and a chain-link fence with anti-tank obstacles on the left. The camera continues to pull back and tilt upward, framing the full height of the fence against the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video presents a heavily fortified border area, beginning with a close-up of a long, rectangular metal grid laid on reddish-brown, sandy ground. Numerous sharp, nail-like spikes protrude vertically from this grid. To the right is a tall, grey concrete wall featuring large grid-like lines running across it. As the perspective widens, the full extent of the fortifications is revealed, including a line of dark, metallic, X-shaped Czech hedgehog anti-tank obstacles beyond the chain-link fence with metal posts, which is identified by the on-screen text \"SIGNAL FENCE\" in a blue box. In the distant background, a guard tower and several multi-story urban buildings are visible under a bright, cloudy sky.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is not a good caption because it fundamentally misunderstands the core instruction by describing the camera's movement instead of the subject's motion.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe description of the camera's movement (pulling back, panning, tilting) and what is revealed (spike strip, wall, fence) is factually accurate to what is happening on screen. However, it is inaccurate in the context of the task, which is to describe the motion of subjects *within* the video, not the cinematography.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete in its description of the camera's path. However, it is entirely incomplete regarding the actual assignment. The video appears to be a scenery shot of a static border with no moving subjects. The caption fails to mention this crucial piece of information, which is the correct output for this type of video according to the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Primary Violation:** The instructions state, \"If the video is a scenery shot without salient subjects, you do not need to describe subject motion. Instead, briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" This video is a scenery shot with no moving subjects. The caption should have simply stated that the scene is static, but instead, it provides a detailed description of the camera's motion, which is explicitly what should be avoided.\n*   **Focus on Subject Motion:** The instructions repeatedly emphasize focusing on the \"subject's motion.\" The camera is the recording device, not the subject of the scene. The caption incorrectly identifies the camera's movement as the primary action to be described.\n*   **Avoid Abstract/Cinematographic Descriptions:** While not overtly abstract, describing camera angles (\"low-angle,\" \"close-up\") and movements (\"pulls backward,\" \"pans,\" \"tilts\") falls into the category of describing the filmmaking process rather than the content of the scene, which goes against the spirit of the instructions.\n\nA correct caption, following the provided rules, would be something like:\n\n\"The video shows a static view of a fortified border, and there are no moving subjects.\"",
