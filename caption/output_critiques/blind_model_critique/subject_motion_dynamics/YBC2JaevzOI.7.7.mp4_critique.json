    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young, fair-skinned man stands in a dark setting, illuminated by a small, lit flashlight he holds in his right hand. He is wearing a light green hoodie with the word \"VANS\" printed in dark letters across the chest and a light-colored baseball cap. His mouth is slightly agape as he looks forward, and the flashlight's beam is directed towards the viewer, casting a bright light on his face and upper torso.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject and the chronological order of his action, it significantly under-describes the most prominent visual motion in the video. The primary visual event is not just the man turning, but the effect of his action: the movement of the flashlight's beam. The caption fails to mention how this beam of light sweeps across the dark environment. Furthermore, the phrase \"rotates his entire body\" is ambiguous; it doesn't specify the speed or the degree of rotation. For instance, the video might show him pivoting slowly in a complete 360-degree circle, causing the light to make a full sweep of the room, or it could be a quick 90-degree turn. A more effective description would detail the motion of the light itself, such as, \"A young man holding a lit flashlight slowly pivots counterclockwise, causing the circular beam of light to sweep from left to right across the dark wall behind him.\" This would more accurately capture the visual experience for the viewer.",
