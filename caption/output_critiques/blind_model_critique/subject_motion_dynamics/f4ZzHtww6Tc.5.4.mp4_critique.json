    "pre_caption": "The man starts by skateboarding down a street lined with parked cars and trees, approaching a set of stairs. He crouches down and prepares to jump, lifting the skateboard off the ground. He successfully jumps over the stairs, maintaining balance in mid-air. After landing, he continues to skateboard smoothly on the sidewalk, adjusting his stance to maintain balance. He skates past a few pedestrians and continues down the sidewalk, passing by more parked cars and trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the **main subject’s framing is not stable** throughout the video, so the description should reflect how their motion and dynamics contribute to this instability.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man skateboarding. He is wearing a white tank top, black pants, and white socks, with black Vans shoes that have white stripes. A black beanie is on his head, and tattoos are visible on his left arm. He is riding a skateboard that has a black deck and light-colored wheels.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good chronological overview, but it lacks the specific terminology needed to accurately describe the skateboarding maneuver, which is the central action of the video. The phrase \"lifting the skateboard off the ground\" is too generic; a more precise description would be that the man \"pops the tail of the board against the pavement to launch it into the air.\" Similarly, \"jumps over the stairs\" could be improved by identifying the trick, such as an \"ollie\" (if the board doesn't rotate) or a \"kickflip\" (if it rotates along its longitudinal axis). The description of being \"in mid-air\" is also a missed opportunity; the video likely shows him holding a specific body posture or grabbing the board, which should be mentioned. Finally, the phrase \"adjusting his stance to maintain balance\" is vague; it would be more descriptive to state that he \"lands with his knees bent to absorb the impact and rolls away\" or \"pushes off once with his foot to regain speed after landing.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man starts by skateboarding down a street lined with parked cars and trees, approaching a set of stairs. He crouches down and pops the tail of the board against the pavement to launch it into the air, performing an ollie over the stairs. In mid-air, he maintains a crouched posture to control the board. After landing with his knees bent to absorb the impact, he smoothly continues to skateboard on the sidewalk. He pushes off once with his foot to regain speed, skating past a few pedestrians and continuing down the sidewalk, passing by more parked cars and trees.",
