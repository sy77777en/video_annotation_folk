    "pre_caption": "A lead cyclist pedals his bicycle down a paved road, moving toward the camera. He is followed by three other cyclists who pedal in a loose formation behind him. A motorcycle with a driver and a passenger operates alongside the trailing cyclists, while a second motorcycle and a line of cars, one equipped with a camera rig, travel behind the entire group as they all move forward along the road.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man, the lead cyclist, rides a black road bike in the center of a paved road. He wears a light blue short-sleeved jersey, black cycling shorts, a white helmet, and sunglasses. Following him are three other male cyclists, all wearing helmets; one wears a red jersey, another wears a yellow and black jersey, and the color of the third cyclist's jersey is not specified. Accompanying the cyclists is a black motorcycle carrying both a driver and a passenger, both wearing dark helmets and jackets, equipped with professional filming equipment. Further back, another motorcycle is operated by a person in a dark uniform and a white helmet. In the midground, three vehicles travel in a line: the first two are black, with the second carrying a large black device likely for filming, and the third vehicle is yellow. Numerous cars and pedestrians are positioned along the roadside.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies all subjects and presents their actions in a logical sequence, it contains a significant contradiction regarding the direction of movement and lacks specificity in its descriptions. The caption states the lead cyclist moves \"toward the camera,\" yet also mentions a camera rig is on a car traveling *behind* the group, which would mean the cyclists are moving *away* from the camera. This fundamental aspect of the shot's perspective needs to be clarified. Furthermore, the description of the cyclists' motion is generic; instead of just \"pedals,\" it could specify that the lead cyclist is \"pedaling at a high cadence while leaning low over the handlebars,\" and the followers are \"drafting in a tight paceline\" rather than just a \"loose formation,\" which would better capture the cooperative nature of their movement. The actions of the support vehicles are also understated; the motorcycle \"operates alongside\" them but could be more accurately described as \"pacing the group\" or \"maneuvering between riders,\" adding more dynamic detail to the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The lead cyclist, pedaling at a high cadence while leaning low over the handlebars, moves away from the camera down a paved road. He is closely followed by three other cyclists drafting in a tight paceline. A motorcycle with a driver and a passenger paces the group, maneuvering between the riders. Behind the entire group, a second motorcycle and a line of cars, including one equipped with a camera rig, follow as they all progress along the road.",
