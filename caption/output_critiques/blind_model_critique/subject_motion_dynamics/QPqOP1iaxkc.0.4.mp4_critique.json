    "pre_caption": "A man and a woman are sitting on a bench by the water, with a city skyline and a bridge in the background. The man is gesturing with his hands while talking, and the woman is looking at him and occasionally moving her hand. The sun is low in the sky, casting a warm glow over the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a man and a woman sitting slightly left of center on a park bench, facing away from the viewer. They are looking out over a body of water towards a city skyline and a bridge in the distance, silhouetted against the bright, low sun. The man, on the left, wears a dark jacket and is gesturing with his hands, suggesting communication. The woman, on the right, wears a dark coat and a light-colored beanie or hat. They are sitting close together.**",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption describes a static scene rather than the dynamic motion expected in a video, failing to adhere to the chronological order instruction. For instance, the video likely shows a sequence of actions, such as the man first turning his head toward the woman, then raising his right hand to point across the water, while the woman, who is initially scrolling on her phone with her thumb, briefly looks up from her screen toward him, nods, and then returns her gaze to the device. The description \"gesturing with his hands\" is too generic and misses the specific motion of pointing, and \"using her phone\" lacks the detail of her scrolling and then looking up. Furthermore, the caption includes the speculative phrase \"as if engaging in conversation\" and the subjective description \"casting a warm glow,\" both of which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions of movement. A more accurate caption would detail the specific, sequential interactions between the subjects and could also include secondary movements, such as cars driving across the bridge in the background or a boat moving across the water, which are entirely omitted.",
