    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up view of a large cylindrical structure with a grid-like pattern on its surface, situated in the center of a building with multiple windows. As the camera moves backward, more of the cylindrical structure and its surroundings become visible, revealing the building's symmetrical layout and the consistent arrangement of windows. The camera continues to pull back, providing a wider view of the structure and the building, emphasizing the cylindrical structure's central position and the uniformity of the architectural design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a large cylindrical structure with a smooth, reflective glass surface, resembling a modern facade. This structure is central and prominent, surrounded by multiple rectangular windows set in a white or light-colored building, suggesting a modern architectural design. The structure appears to be part of a larger building complex, with the windows arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The overall scene conveys a sense of urban architecture with a focus on the distinctive cylindrical element.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption is factually accurate regarding the visual elements (cylindrical structure, windows) and the camera's movement (pulling back).\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption completely describes the camera's motion. However, it fails to describe the *subject's* motion, which is the primary requirement. The subject (the building and its internal structure) appears to be static.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Subject Motion vs. Camera Motion:** The core instruction is to \"focus on the subject’s motion.\" This caption describes the *camera's* motion (\"the camera moves backward,\" \"the camera continues to pull back\") instead of the subject's.\n*   **Handling Static Subjects:** The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The caption should have simply stated that the structure is stationary, but instead, it provides a detailed description of the camera movement revealing the static scene.\n*   **Avoiding Abstract Descriptions:** The caption uses interpretive and abstract language, which is explicitly forbidden. Phrases like \"revealing the building's symmetrical layout\" and \"emphasizing the cylindrical structure's central position and the uniformity of the architectural design\" are abstract interpretations of the visual effect, similar to the forbidden example \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** For a video with a static subject, the description is overly detailed and not concise as instructed.\n\nIn summary, the caption mistakes camera movement for subject movement and uses forbidden abstract language, directly violating the fundamental principles of the instructions. A better caption would have been: \"A large, cylindrical structure inside a building remains stationary as the camera pulls back to reveal more of the surrounding architecture.\"",
