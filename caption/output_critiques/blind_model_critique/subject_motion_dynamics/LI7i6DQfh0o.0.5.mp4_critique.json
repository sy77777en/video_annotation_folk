    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A person with light skin, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt over a light-colored top, holds a small, white, ribbed ramekin. With their fingers, they sprinkle the contents of the ramekin, which appear to be seeds or grains, onto a white, shallow bowl filled with red raspberries and dark blueberries. The bowl of fruit is placed inside a bright orange, square-shaped container with rounded corners and a white inner rim. As the person sprinkles the topping, the word \"FREE\" appears in large, white, sans-serif letters in the center of the scene.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (\"a person\"), the objects involved (\"white ramekin,\" \"bowl of fruit,\" \"raspberries and blueberries\"), and the specific action performed (\"uses their fingers to sprinkle its contents\"). It also accurately describes the on-screen graphic (\"the word 'FREE' appears in large white letters\").\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. It covers all the significant motion and events in the video from start to finish. It describes the initial action of sprinkling and then the subsequent appearance of the text, leaving out no crucial details of the motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption is excellent and adheres to all the given instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence: the person sprinkles the topping, and *then* the word \"FREE\" appears.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It uses specific, action-oriented verbs like \"holds,\" \"uses their fingers to sprinkle,\" \"falls,\" and \"appears,\" focusing entirely on the movement and events.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet provides a full picture of what happens in the video.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language, sticking to a factual description of the visible events.\n*   **Specificity:** The phrase \"uses their fingers to sprinkle\" is a great example of describing *how* an action is performed, which is much better than a generic description like \"adds a topping.\"\n*   **Handling On-Screen Elements:** It correctly treats the appearance of the text \"FREE\" as a key event in the video's timeline, describing it as part of the action sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and objective description of the video's content and motion.",
