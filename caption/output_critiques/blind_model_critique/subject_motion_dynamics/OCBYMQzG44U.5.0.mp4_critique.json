  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is accurate in describing the visual elements of the scene: a flooded hallway, a yellow rubber duck, and a cut to a close-up. However, it is inaccurate in its description of the subject's state. The word \"floating\" is ambiguous; it does not clarify whether the duck is completely motionless or if it is drifting, bobbing, or turning in the water. A motion description requires this level of precision.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to provide the primary information requested by the instructions: a description of the subject's motion. It describes the setting and the subject's presence but omits any details about its movement (or lack thereof). If the duck is entirely still, the caption should have explicitly stated that, as per the instructions for subjects with no movement.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption does not adhere well to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails its primary purpose. It focuses on describing the static scene (\"a long, flooded hallway with white tiled walls\") and the subject's appearance (\"large, yellow rubber duck\") instead of its motion. The instructions explicitly state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Handling No Movement:** The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that.\" The caption implies a static scene but does not explicitly confirm the subject itself is motionless, which is a critical distinction.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption begins with \"This video presents...\", which is introductory text forbidden by the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n*   **Specificity:** It uses the generic term \"floating\" without specifying the type of motion involved, violating the instruction to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\"\n*   **Shot Transitions:** While it correctly identifies the \"cut,\" it fails to describe the subject's motion (or lack thereof) in the second shot, instead only describing the new camera framing (\"a close-up of the duck's face\").",
