    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a single maroon long-sleeved shirt with a collar and white polka dots, made of a soft, textured fabric. The shirt is initially displayed with its sleeves extended outward and the body fully spread, showing all its details clearly. Over the course of the video, the shirt is gradually folded into a compact, rectangular shape, with the sleeves and body neatly tucked in, resulting in a small, tidy bundle. At the very end of the video, the folded shirt, in its rectangular shape, appears to shift slightly to the right on its own.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption accurately describes the state of the shirt in chronological order but fails to describe the motion itself by omitting the agent performing the action. I imagine seeing a pair of hands enter the frame to fold the shirt, but the caption describes the shirt as if it is moving on its own. Instead of the passive \"The sleeves are then folded inward,\" a more accurate description of the motion would be active, such as \"A pair of hands folds each sleeve inward toward the shirt's center.\" Similarly, the phrase \"the body being folded over itself\" is vague; a more specific description based on the visual action, like \"the hands then fold the bottom third of the shirt upward, and then fold it over again to meet the collar,\" would better capture the specific movements. Finally, stating \"the folded shirt shifts slightly to the right\" misses the cause of the motion; it would be clearer to state that \"a hand pushes the finished, folded shirt to the right.\" By focusing on the hands as the subject performing the action, the caption would more effectively describe the motion in the video.",
