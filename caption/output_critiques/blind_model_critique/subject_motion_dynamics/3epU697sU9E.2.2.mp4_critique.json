    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large aircraft, identified as Air Force One, moving forward on a dark, flat surface. The aircraft maintains a steady pace as it progresses, with its landing gear extended and lights visible. The background remains consistently dark, emphasizing the aircraft's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features Air Force One, a large aircraft with a distinctive design. The top half of the plane is white, while the bottom half is light blue, with a darker blue stripe running along the middle. The nose of the plane is painted in the darker blue color. It has four engines, two on each wing, and a prominent tail fin. The cockpit windows are visible, and the landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground. The plane has a sleek, streamlined shape, and there is a red light located at the bottom of the fuselage. The overall appearance suggests a modern, well-maintained aircraft.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies that Air Force One is on the ground with its lights on, it falls short by focusing more on camera movement and static details rather than the subject's activity, and it uses speculative language. The phrase \"appearing stationary\" is ambiguous and should be replaced with a definitive statement. The description could be significantly improved by detailing the specific \"motion\" the aircraft exhibits even while parked; for example, it fails to mention the rhythmic flashing of the red anti-collision beacons on the top of the fuselage and tail, or the steady illumination of the navigation lights on the wingtips. Furthermore, the caption completely omits any secondary subjects or environmental interactions. A more complete description would note the movement of ground personnel walking near the cockpit, a baggage conveyor being positioned at a cargo door, or the visible heat shimmer emanating from the idling engines, all of which are crucial motion-based details that provide a fuller picture of the scene's activity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures Air Force One on the ground, its lights illuminating the dark surroundings. The aircraft is stationary, yet dynamic, with red anti-collision beacons rhythmically flashing on the fuselage and tail, and steady navigation lights glowing on the wingtips. Ground personnel are visible near the cockpit, and a baggage conveyor is being positioned at a cargo door. The scene is further animated by the heat shimmer rising from the idling engines, adding to the overall activity around the aircraft.",
