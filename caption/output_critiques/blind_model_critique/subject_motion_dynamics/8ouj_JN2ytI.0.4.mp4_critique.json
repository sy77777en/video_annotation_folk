    "pre_caption": "The group of men, appearing to be American football players, stands in a line without any movement. They hold their helmets and maintain a serious expression, facing forward. There is no visible motion among the subjects in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A group of men, appearing to be American football players, stand in a line. The man on the far left wears a white jersey with the number 91 in blue and green, blue pants, and a blue headband; he has a dark mark running down the middle of his face and a pair of black eyes. Next to him, a light-skinned man with short blond hair wears a similar white jersey with the number 83. To his right, a dark-skinned man with a short beard and a blue headband wears a white jersey with the number 81. Beside him, another dark-skinned man with a blue headband wears a white jersey with the number 6. All these players have \"RAPID CITY\" printed on their chests, hold blue helmets with \"RCM\" in green, and wear serious expressions. Further to the right, other players in similar uniforms are partially visible. On the far right of the line stands a light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing a blue hoodie and holding a blue and green cap.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows: The caption uses the speculative phrase \"appearing to be,\" which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions. It also describes the subjects' \"serious expression,\" which is a subjective interpretation of emotion rather than a description of motion. The phrase \"slight movements\" is too vague and fails to capture the specific actions seen in the video; for instance, it omits that the player in the center briefly turns his head to the left, the player on the far right shifts his weight from one foot to the other, and another player adjusts the grip on the helmet held in his hands. While the caption correctly notes they are standing in a line, it misses the opportunity to describe these distinct, individual motions that break the static formation, which are the most salient kinetic details in the video. A better description would focus entirely on these specific, observable actions to provide a clearer picture of the scene's subtle activity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The group of American football players stands in a line, each holding their helmets. The player in the center briefly turns his head to the left, the player on the far right shifts his weight from one foot to the other, and another player adjusts the grip on his helmet. These subtle movements add dynamic elements to the otherwise still formation.",
