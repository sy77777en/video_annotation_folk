    "pre_caption": "The video displays a static image with no movement. A piece of paper with a writing prompt is held steady on a wooden surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A white sheet of paper rests on a dark brown wooden surface, held at the bottom right corner by a light-skinned finger with a short, clean nail. The paper features the heading \"WRITING SECTION\" in a black, capitalized, serif font. Below the heading is the question, \"What is the meaning of life?\", followed by two blank horizontal lines. Beneath this paper, a separate sheet displays a partial, stylized illustration of a DNA double helix with cross-hatching.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly describes the video as a \"static image\" when it clearly contains camera motion, which is a fundamental contradiction. The description of the motion itself is vague; stating the camera \"zooms in\" lacks the specificity required. For instance, the video might show a slow, smooth push-in that gradually reframes the shot, or a quick, digital zoom that snaps into the text. The use of the subjective adjective \"effectively\" violates the instruction to avoid such terms. Furthermore, the phrase \"offering a clearer view of the text\" is redundant, as this is the inherent purpose of zooming in. A more accurate caption would chronologically describe the camera's movement from its starting position to its final framing of the writing prompt, detailing the speed and nature of the zoom without subjective commentary.",
