    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man in a white robe with gold trim, wearing a white cap. He has a light skin tone and a short beard.  On the left side of the frame, there is a large gold and brown piece of calligraphy or text. Initially, the man walks toward the camera holding a blue book, which appears to be a religious text. As he approaches, his head moves out of the frame. He then kneels in front of a wooden book stand, fully reentering the frame, and places the book on the stand before opening it. The video ends with a full-body view of him in a kneeling posture, focused on the book.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a man), the objects he interacts with (a book, a book stand), and the sequence of his actions. The description of the events—walking, kneeling, placing the book, opening it, and reading—is a precise representation of the motion.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete, covering the entire sequence of the subject's primary actions in the video. It successfully creates a full narrative of the man's movement from start to finish without leaving out any essential steps.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** Excellent. The actions are presented in a perfect, logical sequence: \"walks towards,\" \"kneels down,\" \"places the book,\" \"opens the book,\" and \"begins to read.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion & Specificity:** Excellent. The caption uses clear, specific action verbs like \"walks,\" \"kneels,\" \"places,\" and \"opens,\" which is much better than a generic description like \"a man interacts with a book.\"\n*   **Object Interaction:** Excellent. The interaction between the man, the book, and the stand is described clearly and effectively (\"places the book on it,\" \"opens the book\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** Very good. The caption is written in simple, natural English and is easy to understand. It forms a coherent paragraph.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** Excellent. The description is entirely objective and avoids any emotional language, speculation, or ambiguity.\n*   **Appearance Details:** This is the main area for improvement. The instruction states, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The phrase \"dressed in a white robe with gold trim and a white cap\" is overly detailed for a video with only one main subject and goes against this specific rule. A more compliant caption would omit the clothing description.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is very good and follows most of the instructions well, particularly regarding the clear, chronological description of motion and object interaction. Its only significant flaw is the inclusion of unnecessary details about the subject's appearance, which directly contradicts one of the negative constraints.\n\n**To make it perfect according to the instructions, it should be revised to:**\n\n\"A man holding a blue book walks towards a wooden book stand. He kneels in front of the stand, places the book on it, opens the book, and begins to read.\"",
