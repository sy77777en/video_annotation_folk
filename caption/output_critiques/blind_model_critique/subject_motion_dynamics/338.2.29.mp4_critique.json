    "pre_caption": "In a restaurant with ornate wall decorations, a woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, raises her hand to greet someone passing by. She then lowers her hand and starts licking her ice cream cone. The woman next to her, dressed in a denim jacket, is talking and gesturing with her left hand while holding chopsticks in her right hand. The table is set with plates of food and drinks, and other patrons and staff are visible in the background, adding to the bustling atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a restaurant scene with a focus on a woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, who is eating an ice cream cone. Next to her, a woman in a denim jacket with light hair styled with volume is engaged in conversation while holding chopsticks in her right hand and gesturing with her left hand. The table is set with plates and drinks, indicating a meal in progress. In the background, other patrons and staff are visible, including a man in a white shirt and maroon vest walking past. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art, creating a lively atmosphere.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video. It violates several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the subjects' motions appears to be accurate and is presented in chronological order (\"raises her hand... then lowers her hand\").\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption describes the actions of the two main subjects and acknowledges the background activity.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to follow the instructions in several critical ways:\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption violates this by including extensive static details about the subjects' appearance (\"long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt,\" \"dressed in a denim jacket\") and the setting (\"ornate wall decorations,\" \"table is set with plates of food and drinks\"). These details should be omitted.\n    *   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses \"ornate\" to describe the walls and characterizes the background as a \"bustling atmosphere,\" both of which are subjective interpretations rather than objective descriptions of motion.\n    *   **Conciseness:** By including unnecessary descriptive details, the caption is not as concise as it should be. The core motion could be described in a much shorter sentence.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the actions in chronological order, it fails by including excessive, non-essential details about appearance and setting, and by using subjective language, all of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions.",
