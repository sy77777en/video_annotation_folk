    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide view of a large lake surrounded by forested hills and mountains under a clear blue sky. As the camera moves forward, a boat appears on the left side of the lake and starts moving across the water, creating ripples behind it. The boat continues to move towards the right side of the frame, leaving a trail in the water. The camera keeps moving forward, capturing the boat as it progresses further across the lake. The boat becomes smaller in the distance as the camera continues to move forward, showing more of the lake and the surrounding landscape. The video ends with the boat almost out of sight, and the camera still moving forward, providing a broader view of the lake and the scenic surroundings.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. While it is accurate and chronological, it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding conciseness and focus.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the visual content of a video featuring a boat on a lake. The sequence of events—the boat appearing, moving across the water, and receding into the distance—is correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description covers the entire motion of the subject from beginning to end. It correctly notes the boat's interaction with the water (creating ripples/a trail).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is not concise. It is repetitive, mentioning the camera's forward movement three separate times (\"As the camera moves forward,\" \"The camera keeps moving forward,\" \"the camera still moving forward\"). This makes the description unnecessarily long and clunky.\n*   **Focus on Subject's Motion:** The instructions state to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions\" and to avoid describing anything not visible. The caption spends too much time describing the static scenery (\"a wide view of a large lake surrounded by forested hills and mountains under a clear blue sky,\" \"scenic surroundings\") and the effects of the camera's movement (\"showing more of the lake,\" \"providing a broader view\"). The focus should be almost exclusively on the boat's movement.\n*   **Describing Cinematography:** The caption describes the act of filming (\"capturing the boat\") rather than the subject's action, which is contrary to the instructions.\n*   **Simplicity and Clarity:** While the language is simple, the repetition and inclusion of irrelevant details about the scenery and camera work make the paragraph less clear and coherent than it should be.\n\n**In summary, the caption is too descriptive of the scenery and the camera's actions, and not focused or concise enough on the primary subject's motion, as required by the instructions.**\n\nA better caption following all instructions would be:\n\nA boat appears on the left side of a lake and moves across the water to the right, creating a wake behind it. The boat continues its path, receding into the distance until it is nearly out of sight.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A boat emerges on the left side of a lake, gliding to the right and leaving a wake. It continues its journey, gradually disappearing into the distance.",
