    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a path covered in yellow leaves, with a hedge of green foliage and yellow flowers in the background. As the camera moves forward, a woman sitting on the ground against the hedge becomes visible. She is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Two men are crouched near her, one in a white shirt and the other in a yellow shirt, both appearing to be focused on something on the ground. The background includes a fence and some parked cars, indicating an outdoor setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video reveals a scene along a path covered with yellow leaves. Initially, the focus is on the leaves and a hedge covered with yellow leaves that have fallen onto it. As the scene unfolds, a woman is shown sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Nearby, two men are facing her. One man is wearing a white shirt and navy jeans, and the other is wearing a yellow shirt. Both men have a fair skin tone. The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence, with multiple cars visible in the distance.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual details described are present in the video, the caption is factually accurate in what it portrays (a path, a woman, two men, etc.). However, its accuracy regarding the *motion* of the subjects is questionable, as it describes static states rather than actions.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in its primary task: describing motion. It details the camera's movement but only describes the subjects' static positions (\"sitting,\" \"crouched\"). If the subjects are performing any actions, the caption completely misses them. If the subjects are entirely still, the caption fails to follow the instruction to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the following instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** **(Major Violation)** The core instruction is to describe the subject's motion. This caption focuses almost entirely on describing the static scene, the subjects' appearance, and their static positions. The only movement described is that of the camera.\n*   **Avoid Speculative Statements:** **(Major Violation)** The caption uses the phrase \"appearing to be focused,\" which is a speculative statement explicitly forbidden by the instructions.\n*   **Be Concise and Avoid Unnecessary Details:** **(Violation)** The caption includes excessive detail about the woman's clothing (\"dark jacket and black pants with white stripes\") and background elements (\"a fence and some parked cars\"). This level of detail is discouraged, as the focus should be on motion.\n*   **Describe Specific Actions:** **(Violation)** Instead of describing what the subjects are doing, it uses vague, static descriptions like \"sitting\" and \"crouched.\" If they were, for example, examining a map or tending to a plant, the caption should have specified that action.\n*   **Handling of \"No Movement\":** **(Violation)** If the subjects are indeed motionless, the instruction is to state this briefly. This caption, instead, provides a lengthy and detailed description of a static scene, which is the opposite of the required approach.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a path covered in yellow leaves. The camera moves forward, revealing a woman sitting against a hedge. She remains still, wearing a dark jacket and black pants. Two men are nearby, one in a white shirt and the other in a yellow shirt, both crouched and motionless, focused on something on the ground. The scene is set outdoors, with a fence and parked cars in the background.",
