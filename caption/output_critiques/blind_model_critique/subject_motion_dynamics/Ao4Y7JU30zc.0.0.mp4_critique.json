    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with a shaved head is seen in silhouette, sitting alone on a bench in what appears to be a dark, hazy locker room. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved hooded sweatshirt, dark pants, and dark sneakers. Leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands clasped, he keeps his head bowed in a contemplative posture. He slowly rubs his hands together and at one point briefly brings both hands close to his mouth. The scene is lit dramatically from one side, casting a long shadow on the wall behind him and obscuring his facial features.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly presents the actions in chronological order, it contains a minor contradiction by stating the man 'sits still' before describing his movements. The description of the motion could also be more specific; for instance, the phrase 'lifts them toward his chin' is ambiguous. In the video, the man might bring his interlocked knuckles up to rest directly under his chin in a thoughtful pose, a detail that would add clarity. Furthermore, the caption ends abruptly. A more complete description would include the conclusion of the action, such as the man lowering his hands back to his lap. The current caption also omits any accompanying head movement, like the man looking down at his hands as he rubs them and then lifting his gaze as he raises them to his chin, which would provide a more thorough account of his motion.",
