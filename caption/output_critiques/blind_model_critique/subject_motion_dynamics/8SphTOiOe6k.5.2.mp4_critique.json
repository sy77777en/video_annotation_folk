    "pre_caption": "A group of students in school uniforms with backpacks are seen queuing outside a traditional Japanese shop with a sign in Japanese characters and hanging white paper decorations. The camera pans left, revealing more of the street and additional pedestrians, including a man in a green beanie and a woman in a striped shirt, both wearing masks. As the camera continues to move, more people are seen walking along the street, some in casual attire and others in traditional clothing. The street is lined with traditional shops, and the background shows a mix of buildings and greenery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions, primarily by focusing heavily on static descriptions of appearance and setting rather than the subjects' motion.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to accurately describe a plausible street scene in Japan. It identifies different groups of people (students, pedestrians) and a camera movement (pan).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption describes an initial scene, a camera movement, and what that movement reveals. In that sense, it covers the sequence of events in the video. However, it is incomplete in its description of motion, choosing instead to fill space with descriptive details.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** This is the most significant failure. The instructions state, \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption dedicates a large portion of its text to static details:\n    *   \"in school uniforms with backpacks\"\n    *   \"a traditional Japanese shop with a sign in Japanese characters and hanging white paper decorations\"\n    *   \"a man in a green beanie and a woman in a striped shirt, both wearing masks\"\n    *   \"some in casual attire and others in traditional clothing\"\n    *   \"The street is lined with traditional shops, and the background shows a mix of buildings and greenery.\"\n    All of these are descriptions of appearance or setting, not motion.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** Because it includes so many unnecessary static details, the caption is not concise. A description focused purely on motion would be much shorter and more to the point.\n\n*   **Avoid Describing Appearance:** The instructions state, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly by describing uniforms, backpacks, a beanie, a shirt, and masks without any need for differentiation.\n\n*   **Use of Passive Voice:** The caption uses \"are seen queuing\" and \"are seen walking.\" The instructions encourage more direct, active descriptions (e.g., \"a runner sprints\" instead of \"a runner is seen sprinting\").\n\n**Where the caption succeeds:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the correct sequence: students are queuing, the camera pans, and more people are revealed walking.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The caption avoids ambiguous or emotional language, sticking to objective observations.\n*   **Clarity and Coherence:** The paragraph is written in simple, natural English and is easy to understand.\n\n**In summary, the caption reads more like a general description of a scene rather than the specific, motion-focused description required by the instructions.**\n\nA better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\nA group of students stands in a queue on a sidewalk. The camera pans to the left, revealing other pedestrians walking in both directions along the street.",
