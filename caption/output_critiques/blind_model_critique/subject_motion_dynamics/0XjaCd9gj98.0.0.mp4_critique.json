    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The central subject is a black, toy rocket with a bright red interior, inside of which stands a black, retro-style toy robot with red feet, a silver ribbed head, and a square torso. To the right, the partial face of a young man with fair skin and dark, shaggy hair, wearing a dark jacket, is visible in the foreground. In the background, several other people are present in a grassy field: a man in a blue jacket, a woman in a dark coat, and another person standing near a camera tripod. A red car and a dark SUV are also visible in the background.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main action but lacks specificity regarding the rocket's motion. The phrase \"ascends and moves forward\" is too general; the video likely shows a more distinct flight path, such as the rocket launching vertically before tilting into a horizontal, arcing trajectory over the field. The description of the people as simply standing and watching misses a crucial interaction, as one person is probably operating a remote control to guide the rocket. Furthermore, the term \"panoramic view\" is ambiguous and should be clarified—for example, by stating that a camera mounted on the rocket pans across the landscape or that the rocket's flight path reveals the view. Finally, the caption dedicates space to static background details like the specific colors of parked cars, which detracts from the primary focus on movement and could be omitted for a more concise and dynamic description of the rocket's flight.",
