    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a comprehensive view of a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan from the rear left corner. Initially, the S550 badging on the back is not visible, but the Mercedes emblem is noticeable on the rear left wheel. Both front  doors and the rear left-side doors are wide open, showcasing the light-colored interior with beige or tan leather seats, door panels, and wood trim accents. The car features a glossy black exterior, silver five-spoke alloy wheels, tinted windows, and a sunroof. Small red reflectors are present on the inner edges of the open doors. As the camera gradually moves backward, the entire vehicle is revealed, with several buildings visible in the background.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the primary camera motion and the fact that the car is stationary. However, it completely misses the most significant visual action related to the subject. By describing the car as simply not moving, the caption fails to capture the dynamic interplay of light and reflection on its surface. As the camera pulls back from the stationary black sedan, the reflections of the surrounding buildings and perhaps the evening sky would glide and warp across the car's polished body panels and windows. This apparent motion is a crucial detail, as it highlights the car's contours and finish. Furthermore, the description \"with its doors open\" is too general; a more effective caption would specify which doors are open and their position (e.g., \"with all four doors swung fully open\"), as this defines the car's silhouette in the shot. The core of the video's visual interest likely lies in the contrast between the static object and the moving world reflected on its surface, a detail that is entirely absent from the current description.",

This dynamic interplay of light and reflection contrasts with the car's stillness, revealing more of the surrounding paved lot and buildings.",
