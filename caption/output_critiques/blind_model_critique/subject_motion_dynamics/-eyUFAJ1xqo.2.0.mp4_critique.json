    "pre_caption": "A man in a long-sleeved shirt dances in a dark room under a purple, gridded, illuminated ceiling. He sways his body and moves his arms rhythmically, first bringing his right hand to the side of his head. He then continues to dance, raising his arms alternately and together, culminating in a moment where he lifts both arms above his head with clenched fists.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a silver-colored mannequin on the left  under purple lighting. The main subject is a man in the center, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. He has short hair and is actively moving his upper body and dancing with his arms raised above his head. The lighting casts a strong purple hue over both the mannequin and the man, creating a distinct visual effect.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent chronological overview of the man's arm movements but lacks specificity and omits key details about his overall motion. The description \"sways his body and moves his arms rhythmically\" is too general; the video shows him performing more distinct actions, such as undulating his torso and tracing circular patterns in the air with his hands. The caption completely ignores his lower body, failing to mention that he continuously shuffles his feet from side to side, grounding his movements. Furthermore, the phrase \"continues to dance\" is a vague transition that glosses over a specific sequence where he rolls his shoulders and brings his hands to his chest before raising them. Finally, the caption misses the dynamic interaction with the environment; the purple grid on the ceiling is not static but pulses in sync with his movements, and the final pose with clenched fists coincides with a bright, intense flash of light from the ceiling, which is a crucial climactic detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man in a long-sleeved shirt dances energetically in a dark room under a purple, gridded ceiling that pulses in sync with his movements. He undulates his torso and traces circular patterns in the air with his hands, while continuously shuffling his feet from side to side, grounding his dynamic performance. He begins by bringing his right hand to the side of his head, then rolls his shoulders and brings his hands to his chest before raising them. The dance culminates in a powerful moment where he lifts both arms above his head with clenched fists, coinciding with a bright, intense flash of light from the ceiling, highlighting the climax of his performance.",
