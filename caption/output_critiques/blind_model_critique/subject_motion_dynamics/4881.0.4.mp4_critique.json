    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a person with fair skin, whose hands are shown painting their fingernails with white polish. The camera then tilts up to reveal the same individual, a man with curly brown hair and a prominent mustache, wearing a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top. He also wears a gold chain necklace and looks directly at the camera with a neutral expression.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a two-part sequence of events: the action of applying nail polish, followed by a camera movement that reveals the subject's face.\n\n**Completeness:** It provides a complete, high-level summary of the video's content. It describes the initial action, the transition (camera tilt), and the final state of the subject, which covers all the essential motion and visual information.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows the chronological order of events: first, the hands applying polish, and second, the camera tilting up to the face.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly focuses on the subject's action (\"apply white polish\") and the camera's motion (\"tilts upward\"). It also describes the final state of the subject (\"looks directly at the camera with a steady gaze\"), which is a valid description of their (lack of) movement.\n*   **Specificity:** The description \"apply white polish to their fingernails\" is specific and clear, fulfilling the instruction to detail object interactions.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and abstract descriptions.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective language. While \"carefully\" can be seen as slightly subjective, in this context, it effectively describes the slow, deliberate quality of the motion, which is acceptable. \"Steady gaze\" is a factual description of the eyes' state.\n*   **Handling Transitions:** It explicitly and correctly describes the camera movement (\"tilts upward\") and its effect (\"revealing a man\"), which perfectly aligns with the instructions for describing transitions and revealing subjects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a clear, concise, and accurate description that follows all the provided instructions, particularly in its chronological structure and its specific description of both the subject's and the camera's motion.",
