    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In the middleground, a person's light-skinned hands are in focus, holding a long, thin object sealed in white paper packaging. The person's shoulder, wearing a light-colored shirt, is visible but out of focus in the foreground. In the background, a young girl with a medium skin tone and dark, curly hair styled in two pigtails is lying in a bed. She is wearing a long-sleeved pink shirt and is propped up against grey pillows, looking at the person holding the package.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the chronological sequence of events and correctly identifies the main and secondary subjects. However, it could be improved by describing the actions with more dynamic and specific language. The phrase \"hold a long, packaged object steady\" is passive; a more active description, such as \"present a long, gift-wrapped box,\" would better convey the initiating action, assuming the packaging is clearly visible as gift wrap. Furthermore, the connection between the two actions feels slightly disconnected. The caption could be strengthened by explicitly linking the presentation of the object to the girl's reaction, for instance, by stating that the object is presented, \"prompting the young girl... to sit up.\" Finally, the description of the girl's movement, \"sits up and leans forward,\" is correct but generic. A more detailed description, such as \"pushes herself upright against the pillows and cranes her neck forward,\" would provide a more vivid and precise account of her motion, better capturing the sense of anticipation that is likely central to the video's content.",
