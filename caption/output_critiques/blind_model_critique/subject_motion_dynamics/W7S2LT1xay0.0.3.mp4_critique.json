    "pre_caption": "From a perspective inside a white car looking out the open driver's door, the car backs out of a garage. The garage door moves past in the background, followed by a brick wall and outdoor scenery as the car continues to reverse and turn. The car door remains open and stationary relative to the camera throughout the motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video highlights a white sedan, with the camera focused on the car's door, capturing both the interior and exterior. The door features a black side mirror and is attached to a car with a tan or light brown interior. As the door swings shut, a faint and indistinct reflection of a person's face briefly appears in the side mirror, showing the front of the face, but no other specific details are discernible.**",

  "generated_critique": "The description of the door's movement as a \"slight clockwise arc, followed by a counterclockwise arc\" is overly technical and difficult to visualize for what is likely a simple, continuous motion. A more natural description, such as \"the door swings inward from an open position,\" would be clearer and more accurate. The caption also misses the primary visual consequence of this motion; it should describe how the view of the exterior scenery, garage, and brick wall is progressively obscured as the door moves toward the car's frame. Furthermore, the phrase \"as the door closes\" is ambiguous about the conclusion of the action. The description would be more complete if it specified the final state, for example, stating that the door swings fully shut until it latches, which would also explain the final change in the visible scene from exterior to interior.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a perspective inside a white car looking out the open driver's door, the car backs out of a garage. As the car reverses and turns, the door swings inward from its open position, gradually obscuring the view of the garage door, brick wall, and outdoor scenery. The door continues to move until it swings fully shut and latches, transitioning the visible scene from exterior to interior.",
