    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The main subject of the video is a person riding a black mountain bike down a steep, rocky, reddish-brown hillside. The rider wears a yellow and black long-sleeved jersey, black pants, and a matching yellow and black full-face helmet. They are shown launching off a dirt ramp and flying through the air. A crowd of spectators, composed of men and women in casual attire like t-shirts, shorts, and hats, watches from a lower vantage point. Some members of the crowd are holding up phones, appearing to film the event. Near the top of the hill, a large blue flag with a red bull logo is planted in the ground.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and presents the actions in chronological order, but it lacks specificity regarding the rider's movements and omits the conclusion of the main action. The phrase \"flies through the air\" is too generic for what is likely the video's climax; a more detailed description, such as \"kicks the bike out sideways in a whip\" or \"tucks into a backflip,\" would better capture the specific maneuver being performed. Furthermore, the description ends abruptly mid-air, failing to describe the landing, which is a critical part of the sequence. The caption should include whether the rider lands smoothly on the downslope or has a rough landing. Finally, the description of the crowd as simply \"watching\" is passive; if they are cheering, holding up phones, or reacting with excitement, mentioning this would provide a more complete picture of the event's atmosphere.",
