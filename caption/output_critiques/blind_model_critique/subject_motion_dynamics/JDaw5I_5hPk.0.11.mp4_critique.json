    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man is seen from behind, walking away from the camera on a wet, sandy beach. He is wearing blue jeans, a dark long-sleeved shirt, and a dark blue puffy vest. In his right hand, he carries a camera mounted on a tripod. He has short, dark hair and appears to be of average build.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** A man walks away from the camera across a wide, wet, sandy beach. He carries a camera mounted on a tripod in his right hand as he moves toward the foggy background.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and perfectly adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a man), his action (walking away from the camera), the object he is interacting with (a camera on a tripod), how he is interacting with it (carries it in his right hand), and the environment he is moving through (a wide, wet, sandy beach toward a foggy background). Every detail mentioned is visibly present in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete, capturing all essential motion. It describes the primary action of walking and the secondary action of carrying an object, providing a full picture of the subject's movement and purpose within the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The action is a single, continuous movement, which the caption describes coherently.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption focuses entirely on the man's motion (\"walks away,\" \"moves toward\") and his interaction with the object (\"carries\"). It avoids describing his static appearance.\n    *   **Specificity:** It is very specific. Instead of \"a man holds something,\" it states he \"carries a camera mounted on a tripod in his right hand.\" The direction of movement is also clearly specified (\"away from the camera,\" \"toward the foggy background\").\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It forms a clear and concise paragraph without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is free of emotional, subjective, or abstract language. It avoids speculation and describes only what is certain and visible.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.",
