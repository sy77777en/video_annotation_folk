    "pre_caption": "The camera starts by focusing on a bicycle parked next to a display board showing various blood type cards and a red vending machine. The camera then pans left, revealing a glass display case filled with model food items, including bowls and plates of different dishes. A man in a dark shirt and mask is seen standing in front of the display case, looking at the items. As the camera continues to move left, more people walking past the display case come into view, including a woman in a white dress and black boots, and another woman in a brown jacket and black shorts.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a bustling street scene with various subjects. A red bicycle with a basket is parked next to a vending machine displaying colorful charts. Several people are walking nearby, including a woman in a tan jacket and black shorts, and another person in a white outfit. A group of individuals, some wearing casual dark clothing, are gathered near a traditional storefront with hanging lanterns and signs. The scene captures a lively urban environment with a mix of modern and traditional elements.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it could be improved by being more concise and focusing more strictly on motion.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Excellent:** The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events in a video. The description of the camera's movement and the subjects it reveals is logical and clear.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Excellent:** The caption provides a complete, chronological account of the motion from the beginning to the end of the described segment. It covers the primary motion (the camera pan) and the secondary motions of the people who are revealed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels at this, using phrases like \"starts by,\" \"then,\" and \"As the camera continues\" to create a clear and easy-to-follow timeline.\n    *   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, straightforward, and easy to understand.\n    *   **No Subjectivity or Speculation:** It correctly avoids emotional adjectives and speculative language.\n    *   **Describing Revealed Subjects:** It effectively describes how the camera's motion \"reveals\" and brings new subjects \"into view.\"\n    *   **Differentiating Subjects:** It uses appearance details (\"man in a dark shirt,\" \"woman in a white dress\") appropriately to differentiate between the multiple people in the scene.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion vs. Static Details:** The primary weakness is the over-description of static objects. The instruction states to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The detailed descriptions of the \"bicycle parked,\" \"display board showing various blood type cards,\" \"red vending machine,\" and \"model food items\" are static details that detract from the focus on motion. A more compliant caption would mention these objects only as reference points for the camera's movement.\n    *   **Conciseness:** As a result of including too many static details, the caption is longer and less concise than it could be. Removing the detailed descriptions of the objects would make the caption more focused and impactful.\n\n**In summary, the caption successfully follows most instructions, particularly regarding chronological order and clear language. However, it violates the key instruction to focus on motion by including excessive detail about static objects.**",
