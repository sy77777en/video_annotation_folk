    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man is shown in a dark, heavily silhouetted profile shot. A bright light source from behind and to the left illuminates the outline of his head, shoulders, and hands, while the rest of his form is cast in deep shadow. His head is bowed forward, and his hands are clasped together in front of his mouth. Due to the dramatic lighting, his facial features, expression, and clothing are not visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies that the subject, a man, does not move throughout the video. The description of his static pose—\"head bowed and hands clasped in front of his mouth\"—is a precise and factual account of what is visible.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. For a video with no movement, the instruction is to \"briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" This caption does exactly that by stating the man \"remains completely still\" and then provides just enough detail about the pose to be informative without being excessive. It covers the entire duration of the video (\"throughout the video\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres perfectly to all given instructions:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It directly addresses the subject's motion (or lack thereof) as the central point.\n*   **Chronological Order:** This is not applicable as there is no sequence of actions, but the caption correctly describes a continuous state.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, clear, and gets straight to the point in a single, coherent sentence.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"he looks sad,\" \"he might be praying\").\n*   **Specificity:** It is specific about the lack of movement (\"remains completely still\") and the nature of the pose, which is more descriptive than simply saying \"the man is not moving.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to apply the instructions to a video with a static subject. It is accurate, concise, and follows every rule, resulting in a clear and effective description.",
