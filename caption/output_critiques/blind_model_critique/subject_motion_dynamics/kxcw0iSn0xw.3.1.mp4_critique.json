    "pre_caption": "A pair of hands is seen interacting with a twisted light blue balloon submerged in a water tank. The hands press the balloon, and the outer skin of the balloon begins to shrink rapidly. The puncture causes the water inside the balloon to start dispersing, and the balloon's shape becomes less defined. The hands continue to hold the balloon as the water inside fully disperses, and the balloon's outer skin is significantly shrunk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a pair of hands and the lower half of the arms, which have visible arm hair, interacting with a twisted long balloon submerged in a water tank. The hands, with light skin tone, are positioned to press the light blue balloon into the water. The left hand holds a pin, used to puncture the balloon, causing its outer skin to shrink rapidly. Despite the puncture, the water inside initially retains the balloon's shape before dispersing. The hands are engaged in a precise action, demonstrating a controlled and deliberate movement.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good for the video. It is accurate, complete, and closely follows the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible and common video scenario: a water balloon being manipulated and popped underwater. The sequence of events—pressing, the skin shrinking, water dispersing, and the final shrunken state—is described logically and correctly.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive. It captures the entire motion from the initial interaction to the final result. It successfully describes the action of the primary subject (the hands pressing and holding) and the reaction of the object (the balloon shrinking and dispersing its contents).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption excels at following the specific rules:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear, step-by-step sequence: the hands press, the skin shrinks, the water disperses, and the skin is left shrunken.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It uses strong, descriptive verbs focused on movement and change (\"press,\" \"shrink rapidly,\" \"dispersing,\" \"fully disperses\").\n*   **Objectivity and Specificity:** It avoids subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"amazing\") and speculative language (\"it appears,\" \"might be\"). The description of the interaction (\"hands press the balloon\") and its effect (\"outer skin... begins to shrink rapidly\") is specific and clear.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is well-written in simple, natural English. It is informative without being overly wordy.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The language is concrete and focuses on the physical actions rather than interpreting them abstractly.\n\nThe caption is an excellent example of how to follow the given instructions to produce a high-quality, descriptive summary of motion.",
