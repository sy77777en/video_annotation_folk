    "pre_caption": "A man on a mountain bike rides up a ramp on a moving flatbed train car, launches into the air, and executes a frontflip. He lands on top of a blue shipping container on the next car and rides along its length. Upon reaching the end of the container, he rides off a set of stairs and performs a backflip, landing on another flatbed car and continuing to ride forward as the train moves along the tracks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man wearing a blue helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants performs stunts on a black mountain bike atop a moving freight train. He rides up a blue ramp featuring a Red Bull logo, executes a forward roll in mid-air, and lands on a large blue shipping container. This container is marked with a wide red stripe bearing the word \"PRADA\" in white capital letters. The man then rides along the top of the container before performing a backflip over a set of white stairs attached to its end, landing on another flatbed car.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a complex sequence of actions. It correctly identifies the subject (a man on a mountain bike), the environment (a moving train with flatbed cars and a shipping container), and the specific stunts performed (frontflip, backflip).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures the entire motion from the beginning to the end, including the initial ramp, the first trick, the traversal of the container, the second trick, and the final landing, all while noting the continuous motion of the train.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows the chronological sequence of events: \"rides up,\" \"launches,\" \"executes a frontflip,\" \"lands,\" \"rides along,\" \"rides off,\" \"performs a backflip,\" \"landing,\" and \"continuing to ride.\"\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It focuses exclusively on the subject's motion, using strong, specific action verbs (e.g., \"launches,\" \"executes,\" \"lands,\" \"rides along\").\n    *   **Specificity and Clarity:** The description is highly specific and avoids generic terms. Instead of \"does tricks,\" it states \"executes a frontflip\" and \"performs a backflip.\" It clearly describes the interaction with objects like the ramp, container, and stairs.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption is entirely objective. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (e.g., \"amazing,\" \"daring\") and speculative language (e.g., \"it appears,\" \"he might be\").\n    *   **Conciseness:** While describing a lot of action, the paragraph is concise and delivers the information efficiently without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Formatting:** It adheres to the required format of a single, unformatted paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, detailed, objective, and perfectly structured to describe the subject's motion.",
