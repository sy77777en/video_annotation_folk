    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a close-up of the rear passenger side of a black car with a glossy finish. The rear passenger door is open, revealing a tan leather interior, specifically the back of a front seat which has a storage pocket. A large, silver, five-spoke alloy wheel is prominently featured, with a Mercedes-Benz logo in the center cap and \"AMG\" lettering visible on one of the thick, slightly angular spokes. The black rubber tire has visible sidewall lettering, including \"CONTINENTAL,\" and a silver brake disc with a darker brake caliper can be seen behind the wheel spokes. Part of the car's roof, including a sunroof, is also visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to follow the core instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the visual events in the video, detailing how the camera moves to reveal different parts of a car.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete in describing the visual sequence.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** This is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of Core Instruction:** The primary instruction is to \"Provide a concise yet informative description of the **subject’s motion**\" and to \"Focus on the **subject's motion**.\" The subject in this video is a \"stationary car.\" The caption correctly identifies the car as stationary but then proceeds to describe the **camera's motion** (\"trucks to the left and tilts upward\"). This is a direct violation of the rule to describe the subject's movement, not the camera's.\n*   **Violation of \"No Movement\" Rule:** The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The subject (the car) has no movement. Instead of briefly mentioning this, the caption provides a detailed description of the camera's actions, which is contrary to the instruction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the caption is well-written, clear, and chronologically accurate in describing the visual action, it fundamentally misunderstands the task. It describes the cinematography (camera movement) rather than the subject's motion. According to the provided rules, a correct caption would be much simpler, such as: \"A car remains stationary with its rear passenger door open.\"",
