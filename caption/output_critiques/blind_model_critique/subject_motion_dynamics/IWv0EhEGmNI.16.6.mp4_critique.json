    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video primarily focuses on a man positioned in front of a woman, engaged in a conversation. The man wears a dark-colored beanie, a dark green tactical jacket, and a tactical vest with \"G-25\" printed on it. He has a prominent dark brown mustache and beard, and light skin. He is holding a rifle and looking towards the woman. The woman, seen mostly from her back, has blonde hair styled in a neat bun and is wearing a light-colored, possibly white or very light grey, collared shirt or jacket. She is facing the man. In the dimly lit background, several other figures in military-style attire are visible but are out of focus.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary subject and the general nature of his actions, it lacks the specificity needed to fully describe the motion seen in the video. The phrase \"subtly nods his head\" is vague; in the video, the man performs a single, slow, and deliberate downward nod for emphasis after he finishes a sentence. Similarly, \"his facial expression shifts slightly\" fails to capture the distinct sequence of movements: as he speaks, his brow is relaxed, but when he pauses and nods, his jaw tightens and his eyes narrow, conveying a shift in intensity. The caption also mentions that he \"speaks\" but omits the corresponding physical motion of his lips moving. A more accurate description would chronologically detail these specific micro-expressions and gestures, such as, \"The man in the beanie leans forward slightly, his lips moving as he speaks, then pauses, tightens his jaw, and gives a single, slow nod.\" This provides a much clearer and more informative account of the subject's precise movements.",
