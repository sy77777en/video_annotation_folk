    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a horizontal timeline against a black background, marked with white lines and time stamps at regular intervals, such as 10:05, 10:10, 10:15, 10:20, and 10:25, with additional timestamps at 10:12 and 10:18. A short red vertical line moves to the right, representing the passage of time, and is currently approaching and passing the 10:12 mark. The design is minimalistic, focusing on the linear progression of time, with the red line serving as a dynamic visual indicator of significance or emphasis within the sequence.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the primary motion of the red line along the timeline. However, it could be more specific about the interaction between the moving line and the static elements. For instance, the caption doesn't clarify if the \"glowing red vertical line\" passes over and momentarily obscures the white timestamps and tick marks, or if the line is semi-transparent, allowing the background elements to remain visible through it as it moves. Additionally, the term \"glowing\" is treated as a static attribute; if the glow itself has motion, such as pulsing in intensity or flaring as it crosses the \"10:12\" mark, this dynamic detail is missing. Finally, the description of the motion's beginning and end is incomplete; it's unclear whether the line is already on the timeline when the video starts or if it animates into the frame from the left, and likewise, whether the video ends while the line is still in motion or if it reaches a specific endpoint before stopping.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A short, glowing red vertical line moves steadily from left to right along a horizontal white timeline, starting just before the 10:12 timestamp. As it progresses, the line momentarily obscures the white tick marks and timestamps, indicating the passage of time. The line is semi-transparent, allowing the background elements to remain faintly visible through it. The glow of the line pulses gently, flaring slightly as it crosses the 10:12 mark. The line animates into the frame from the left at the beginning of the video and continues moving until it reaches a specific endpoint, where it stops before the video concludes. The rest of the timeline, with its white tick marks and timestamps against a black background, remains static throughout.",
