    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a horizontal timeline against a black background, marked with white lines and time stamps at regular intervals, such as 10:05, 10:10, 10:15, 10:20, and 10:25, with additional timestamps at 10:12 and 10:18. A short red vertical line moves to the right, representing the passage of time, and is currently approaching and passing the 10:12 mark. The design is minimalistic, focusing on the linear progression of time, with the red line serving as a dynamic visual indicator of significance or emphasis within the sequence.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good. It effectively and accurately describes the video's content according to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary moving subject (\"a short, glowing red vertical line\") and its specific motion (\"moves steadily from left to right\"). It also accurately describes the static environment (\"a horizontal white timeline... with its white tick marks and timestamps against a black background, remains static\").\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is complete, capturing all essential aspects of the motion. It specifies the direction, speed (\"steadily\"), and path of the subject. It also provides context by mentioning the timestamps the line passes, which helps to quantify the movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption follows the motion chronologically by stating the line \"starts just before the 10:12 timestamp and progresses past it.\"\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on the line's movement and its relationship to the static timeline, successfully avoiding irrelevant details.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It forms a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective words. Adjectives like \"short,\" \"glowing,\" \"red,\" and \"vertical\" are purely descriptive.\n*   **No Speculation:** It describes only what is visibly happening without using speculative phrases.\n*   **Specificity:** It clearly describes the subject's interaction with an object, detailing how the line moves \"along a horizontal white timeline.\"\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption avoids abstract interpretations of the motion's quality. While \"indicating the passage of time\" is an interpretation, it is a direct and universally understood function of a timeline scrubber, making it an informative and acceptable detail rather than an abstract flourish.",
