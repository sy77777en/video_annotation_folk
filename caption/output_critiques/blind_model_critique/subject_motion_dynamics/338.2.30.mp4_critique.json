    "pre_caption": "A woman in a maroon vest and white shirt is licking an ice cream cone while sitting at a table in a restaurant, with another woman in a denim jacket sitting beside her, watching her. The camera then pans to the left, revealing a man in a yellow shirt sitting alone at a table, smiling and looking towards the camera. The background of the restaurant includes other diners, a decorative wall with intricate designs, and a circular opening with a view into another area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, wearing glasses, seated at a table. She is holding an ice cream cone and appears to be enjoying it. Next to her is another woman with blonde hair, wearing a denim jacket, who is looking at her with a slight smile. The scene transitions to a man in a yellow shirt sitting at a different table, which is set with various dishes. He is facing the camera and smiling. The setting is a restaurant with ornate decor, featuring intricate patterns and a circular opening in the background. The transition between subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the women to the man.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially good but has significant flaws in its adherence to the provided instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate, literal description of the events in the video. It correctly identifies the subjects, their actions, and the camera movement in a logical sequence.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in that it describes the initial scene, the transition, and the final scene. It covers the actions of all primary and secondary subjects.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails in several key areas:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Excessive Focus on Appearance:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" The caption describes the clothing of all three main subjects (\"maroon vest and white shirt,\" \"denim jacket,\" \"yellow shirt\"), which is unnecessary and distracts from the primary goal of describing motion.\n*   **Violation 2: Describing Static Background:** The instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" The final sentence, \"The background of the restaurant includes other diners, a decorative wall with intricate designs, and a circular opening with a view into another area,\" describes the static scenery. This is a direct violation of the instructions.\n*   **Violation 3: Lack of Conciseness:** As a result of including unnecessary appearance and background details, the caption is not concise. Removing this extra information would make it much stronger and more aligned with the goal of a \"concise yet informative description.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption successfully describes the subjects' motions in chronological order (\"licking an ice cream cone,\" \"watching her,\" \"camera pans,\" \"smiling and looking\") and uses clear, simple language. However, it significantly violates the core instructions by including detailed descriptions of clothing and the static background, which detracts from its primary purpose of focusing on motion.\n\nA better caption, following all instructions, would be:\n\n**A woman licks an ice cream cone while sitting at a table as another woman watches her. The camera then pans to the left, revealing a man sitting at another table who smiles and looks toward the camera.**",
