    "pre_caption": "Two men, one in an orange shirt with a blue backpack and the other in a blue and white jacket, are seen descending a stone staircase. They continue to walk down the stairs, approaching a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars. The men reach the bottom of the stairs and stand in front of the door, examining it closely. The man in the orange shirt turns his head to look back, while the other man remains facing the door.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two men descending a staircase in an ancient architectural setting. The man on the left wears an orange shirt and a blue backpack, while the man on the right is dressed in a blue and white jacket. Initially seen from behind, they approach a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars. The setting emphasizes the stone walls and the architectural details surrounding the men as they move towards the door.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the chronological order of events but lacks specificity in describing the subjects' motions. The terms \"descending\" and \"walk down\" are redundant and could be replaced with a more detailed description of their gait; for instance, the video might show them walking cautiously down the worn, uneven steps, with the man in the orange shirt trailing slightly behind. The phrase \"examining it closely\" is an interpretation rather than a description of a physical action. A more precise caption would describe what this examination entails, such as one man pointing to the red stars while the other leans in, tracing the geometric patterns with his finger. Finally, the description of the last action is too simple; the man in the orange shirt might turn to look directly back up the staircase, while the other man, instead of just \"remaining,\" could be seen reaching out to touch the door or trying the handle, providing a more concrete conclusion to their movement.",
