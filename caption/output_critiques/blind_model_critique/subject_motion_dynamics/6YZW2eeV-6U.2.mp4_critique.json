    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two men descending a staircase in an ancient architectural setting. The man on the left wears an orange shirt and a blue backpack, while the man on the right is dressed in a blue and white jacket. Initially seen from behind, they approach a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars. The setting emphasizes the stone walls and the architectural details surrounding the men as they move towards the door.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** Two men, one in an orange shirt with a blue backpack and the other in a blue and white jacket, are seen descending a stone staircase. They continue to walk down the stairs, approaching a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars. The men reach the bottom of the stairs and stand in front of the door, examining it closely. The man in the orange shirt turns his head to look back, while the other man remains facing the door.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is very good and follows most of the instructions well. However, there are minor areas where it could be improved to align more perfectly with the guidelines.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption describes a clear, plausible, and logical sequence of events. Assuming it matches the video, it is accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is complete, covering the subjects' entire journey from descending the stairs to their final actions in front of the door. It successfully captures all primary movements.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The caption excels here. It presents the actions in a perfect, step-by-step sequence: descending, approaching, reaching the bottom, standing/examining, and finally, one man turning his head.\n*   **Clarity and Objectivity:** The language is simple, natural, and free of emotional, subjective, or speculative words (\"might be,\" \"appears\").\n*   **Specific Actions:** It uses specific verbs like \"descending,\" \"examining,\" and \"turns his head\" rather than generic terms.\n*   **Subject Differentiation:** It effectively uses appearance details (\"orange shirt,\" \"blue and white jacket\") to distinguish between the two men when their actions diverge at the end. This is a correct application of the instruction.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Static Details:** The instruction states to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" While mentioning the door is necessary context for their movement, the detailed description (\"a gray door with geometric patterns and red stars\") shifts focus away from the subjects' motion and onto a static object. A more concise mention, like \"a gray door,\" would be more aligned with the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness:** There is a slight redundancy. The caption says the men are \"descending a stone staircase\" and then that they \"continue to walk down the stairs.\" These two phrases describe the same continuous action. They could be combined for a more concise sentence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is good.** It successfully follows the most critical instructions, particularly regarding chronological order, clarity, and objectivity. The minor deviations are related to conciseness and an over-emphasis on a static object's appearance. It effectively communicates the subjects' movements in a clear and detailed manner.",
