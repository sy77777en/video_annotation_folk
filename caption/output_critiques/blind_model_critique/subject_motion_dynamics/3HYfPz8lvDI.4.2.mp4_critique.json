  "generated_critique": "Your caption contains a significant contradiction by stating that \"cardboard boxes appear and fill the space\" while also claiming \"The scene remains still throughout the clip.\" The scene's content is clearly changing, so only the camera is static. The description of the motion is also too vague; the word \"appear\" fails to specify *how* the boxes materialize. For instance, the video might show the boxes being added one by one in a stop-motion sequence, stacking rapidly from the floor upwards, or perhaps they fade into view simultaneously. A more effective caption would resolve the contradiction by noting the static camera angle and then use more descriptive verbs to detail the specific manner and chronological pattern of the boxes filling the office, which would better adhere to the instruction to describe how subjects move.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera remains static, capturing an office through an opening in a brick wall. Initially, the office is fully furnished, but then cardboard boxes begin to stack rapidly from the floor upwards, gradually filling the space and obscuring the furniture. The scene focuses on the dynamic transformation of the office as the boxes accumulate.",
