    "pre_caption": "A group of people are playing basketball on an outdoor court with graffiti on the walls. A person in blue jeans and white sneakers runs past the basketball, which has a human face and appears to be talking. The basketball's facial expressions change, showing various emotions as the people continue to play in the background. The basketball's mouth opens and closes, indicating it is speaking or reacting to the game. The players continue their game, moving around the court, while the basketball remains in the foreground, still animated and expressive.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a basketball court scene with a unique basketball as the main subject. The basketball, positioned prominently in the foreground, has a human face with expressive features, including eyes and a mouth, giving it a surreal appearance. In the background, several people are playing basketball. They are dressed in casual sportswear, with one person wearing a green jacket and white pants, and another in a blue top. The players are engaged in the game, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The court is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls, enhancing the urban setting. The focus remains on the animated basketball, which stands out due to its unusual and eye-catching design.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in its structure and clarity but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. It correctly identifies the subjects (a group of people, an animated basketball) and their primary actions (playing basketball, running, changing facial expressions). The chronological flow is logical, starting with the general scene, focusing on a specific action, and then describing the ongoing state of the main and background subjects.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is reasonably complete. It establishes the setting (outdoor court with graffiti), identifies the main subject of interest (the animated basketball), and describes its actions in relation to the background activity. It successfully paints a clear picture of the events in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** It presents the actions in a logical sequence: people are playing, a person runs past, the basketball reacts, and the game continues.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** It describes specific movements like \"runs past the basketball\" and \"mouth opens and closes.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Differentiation:** It uses appearance details (\"in blue jeans and white sneakers\") appropriately to distinguish one person from the group.\n\n**Where the caption violates the instructions:**\n*   **Speculative Language:** The instruction explicitly forbids speculative statements like \"it appears.\" The caption violates this with \"**appears to be** talking\" and \"**indicating** it is speaking.\" It should only describe the visible action, which is the mouth opening and closing.\n*   **Emotional or Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction forbids emotional or subjective words. The caption violates this rule by using \"**emotions**\" and \"**expressive**.\" Instead of interpreting the expressions as \"emotions,\" the caption should have described the physical changes on the basketball's face (e.g., \"its eyes widen and its mouth forms a frown\").\n\nIn summary, while the caption effectively describes the scene, it fails on the critical negative constraints of avoiding speculation and subjective interpretation. A better caption would describe only the observable physical movements without inferring intent, emotion, or meaning.",
