    "pre_caption": "The video features three stylized, low-polygon human figures in a dimly lit setting. In the foreground, a figure with a form and short, wreath-like hairstyle suggestive of a female is seated at a desk, appearing to type on a computer. This figure is rendered in a light gray, angular style, but its head and torso are strongly illuminated by a red light, giving them a distinct red appearance, while its arms and hands also show a red tint. In the background, to the right, stand two other figures. The figure closer to the center, with a build and attire resembling a formal suit, stands with arms crossed and appears to be male. The figure further to the right is partially obscured, has a hand on their hip, and is wearing a scarf, suggesting they are female. Both background figures are a uniform light gray or white, with subtle blueish ambient lighting, and are rendered in a low-polygon, angular style. All three figures have featureless, angular faces.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features three stylized, low-polygon human figures in a dimly lit setting.

  "generated_critique": "Your caption focuses entirely on the static appearance, posture, and lighting of the figures, failing to describe any of the motion present in the video, which was the core instruction. For instance, you state the foreground figure is \"appearing to type,\" but the video clearly shows the figure's hands and fingers moving rapidly and continuously across the desk's surface. The caption also misses that the two background figures are not completely still; the figure with crossed arms periodically shifts its weight and turns its head toward the typist, while the other figure with a hand on its hip subtly gestures with their free hand as if in a silent conversation. Furthermore, the description of the lighting is incomplete as it omits the dynamic element: the red light illuminating the main figure pulses faintly in sync with the typing motion. A more accurate description would omit the detailed physical attributes and instead chronologically detail these specific actions to provide a clear account of the subjects' movements.",
