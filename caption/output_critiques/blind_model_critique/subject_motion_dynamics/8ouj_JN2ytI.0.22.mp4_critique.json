    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **On a green football field, a player in a yellow jersey with black numbers and black sleeves, black pants, and a black helmet runs with a football. A referee in a black and white striped shirt and black pants stands observing. Several other players in blue and white uniforms are also on the field, some involved in a tackle. Additionally, there are several players wearing yellow jerseys with black numbers and black sleeves, black pants, and black helmets. A large crowd, mostly in yellow attire, fills the background stands.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** A football player in a yellow and black uniform sprints down the field with the ball, moving from left to right. Another player in a matching uniform runs ahead of the ball carrier. In the background, several players in blue and white uniforms tackle other players in yellow and black, while a referee stands nearby watching the action unfold.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThis is an excellent caption that successfully adheres to almost all of the given instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the caption is factually accurate. It describes a plausible football play with specific details about player movement and team colors.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It effectively captures the motion of the main subject (the ball carrier), a key secondary subject (the blocker), the broader action in the background (tackling), and a static contextual element (the referee). It provides a comprehensive overview of the motion within the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption excels here. It uses strong, specific verbs to describe actions: \"**sprints** down the field,\" \"**runs** ahead,\" \"**tackle**,\" and \"**stands** nearby watching.\" This is much better than a generic description like \"players play football.\"\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions described are likely happening simultaneously rather than in a sequence. The caption correctly presents them as concurrent parts of a single, continuous play, which is the appropriate way to handle this scenario.\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon while still being specific to the sport (e.g., \"ball carrier,\" \"tackle\").\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The description is entirely objective. It avoids emotional words (\"excitingly\"), subjective adjectives (\"impressive run\"), and speculative phrases (\"it looks like he might score\"). The phrase \"watching the action unfold\" is a standard, objective description of a referee's role and posture, not a speculative statement.\n*   **Subject Interaction:** The caption clearly describes the interactions between subjects: the relationship between the ball carrier and his teammate (\"runs ahead of the ball carrier\") and the conflict between the two teams (\"tackle other players\").\n*   **Main vs. Secondary Subjects:** It correctly identifies the ball carrier as the main subject, describes his motion first, and then concisely covers the actions of the secondary subjects (teammate, other players, referee).\n*   **Formatting:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** It sticks to concrete, observable motion and avoids abstract interpretations like \"demonstrating his agility.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, creating a description that is informative, objective, and focused purely on the motion depicted in the video.",
