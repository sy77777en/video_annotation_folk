    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a blurry image of a woman, which gradually becomes clearer as she lifts her head and looks directly at the camera. The background is a soft, out-of-focus outdoor setting, suggesting a calm and serene environment. The woman maintains a serious expression throughout the sequence, and her posture remains upright and composed.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman with medium skin tone and dark hair pulled back, wearing a black top. Her expression is serious and focused. She is centrally positioned and facing forward, with a clear and direct gaze. The lighting enhances all of her facial features, providing a balanced emphasis on her eyes, lips, and overall visage.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates several key instructions. While it correctly identifies the subject's main action in chronological order, it includes subjective language and focuses on static details rather than just motion.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   Assuming the video shows what is described, the chronological description of the motion (\"lifts her head and looks directly at the camera\") and the camera effect (\"blurry image... gradually becomes clearer\") is accurate.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The caption captures the primary movement of the subject. However, it describes the subject's state *after* the motion (\"maintains a serious expression,\" \"posture remains upright\") rather than describing any further subtle movements that might be present.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to follow the instructions in several critical ways:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses multiple subjective words, such as **\"calm,\" \"serene,\" \"serious,\"** and **\"composed.\"** These are interpretations of mood and state, not objective descriptions of motion.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid speculative statements\":** The phrase **\"suggesting a calm and serene environment\"** is a speculative interpretation of the background, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on the subject's motion\":** The caption dedicates significant space to describing static elements, such as the **\"out-of-focus outdoor setting,\"** the woman's **\"serious expression,\"** and her **\"upright and composed\"** posture. The instructions require the focus to be on movement.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid abstract descriptions\":** Describing the environment as **\"calm and serene\"** is an abstract interpretation of the scene's mood rather than a concrete description of what is happening.\n\nA better caption adhering to the rules would be:\n\n**The video starts with a blurry, out-of-focus shot that sharpens to reveal a woman, who then lifts her head to look forward.**",
