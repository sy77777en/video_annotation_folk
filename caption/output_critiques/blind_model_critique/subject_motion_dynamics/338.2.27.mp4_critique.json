    "pre_caption": "In a restaurant with a red patterned carpet and several tables covered with white tablecloths, a person on a green hoverboard moves from the right side of the frame to the center. The hoverboard rider, dressed in black pants and a dark shirt, navigates through the space without interacting with the tables. The patrons, including a man in a striped shirt and jeans and a woman with long blonde hair in a pure muted beige top, continue their dining activities, seemingly unaware of the hoverboard rider's presence. A small, round, turquoise robotic vacuum is also seen moving between the tables, contributing to the busy atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with a clear main focus**, so the description should focus on the motion and dynamics of the main subject while providing a concise overview of secondary subjects' movements.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video captures a bustling restaurant setting with several people seated at tables. A person on a green hoverboard moves from the right side of the frame to the center, wearing black pants and a dark shirt. This individual appears to be a server but is not interacting with any tables. Among the patrons, a man in a striped shirt and jeans and a woman with long blonde hair in a pure muted beige top are visible, engaged in conversation and dining. A small, round, turquoise robotic vacuum is seen moving between the tables, adding to the lively dining environment.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it correctly identifies the subjects and some of their movements, it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is not good:\n\n**1. Excessive and Irrelevant Detail:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" and \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects...\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** The caption includes extensive descriptions of the setting (\"a red patterned carpet and several tables covered with white tablecloths\") and the appearance of secondary subjects (\"a man in a striped shirt and jeans and a woman with long blonde hair in a pure muted beige top\"). This information is not related to motion and is explicitly discouraged by the instructions.\n\n**2. Use of Speculative and Subjective Language:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options...\" and \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** The phrase \"**seemingly unaware** of the hoverboard rider's presence\" is a speculative assumption about the patrons' mental state. The instruction is to describe only what is visible. A better description would be that the patrons do not visibly react. Additionally, the phrase \"**contributing to the busy atmosphere**\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene, not an objective description of motion.\n\n**3. Generic Description of Motion:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Describe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** The description of the patrons' motion as \"continue their dining activities\" is too generic. The instruction calls for more specificity if visible (e.g., \"patrons eat and talk at their tables\"). Similarly, the vacuum \"moving between the tables\" could be more specific about its path if a clear pattern is visible.\n\n**4. Lack of Conciseness:**\n*   **Instruction:** \"Provide a concise yet informative description...\" and \"create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph.\"\n*   **Caption's Failure:** Due to the inclusion of unnecessary details about the setting and clothing, the caption is not concise. It dedicates significant length to static details rather than focusing purely on the essential actions.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it is bloated with irrelevant descriptive details, includes speculative and subjective language, and uses generic terms for motion, all of which directly contradict the provided instructions. A good caption would focus strictly on the objective, chronological movements of the subjects (rider, vacuum, patrons) in simple, direct language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person on a green hoverboard glides smoothly from the right to the center of the restaurant, skillfully avoiding the tables. Patrons at the tables continue eating and talking, showing no visible reaction to the hoverboard rider. A small turquoise robotic vacuum moves in a zigzag pattern between the tables, adding to the dynamic scene.",
