    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A rectangular board, standing upright on a light-colored wooden tabletop, features a black-and-white photographic cutout of a dolphin's head and upper body emerging from choppy water. The dolphin, facing left with its mouth open revealing small teeth, has a yellow and orange striped party hat collaged onto its head. The background of the board behind the dolphin image is light-colored with thin vertical lines. Behind and to the left of this board, a black landline telephone with a handset resting on its base is visible. To the left of the dolphin board and in front of the telephone, several pens lie on the tabletop; one is black, another is white, and to the right of the white pen is a third pen with a dark cap. There is also a fourth pen that is possibly blue. Behind these pens and near the telephone, there is a grey square-shaped device that appears to be a calculator. A silver computer mouse is partially visible in the bottom left corner.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies that the listed tabletop objects are stationary, it inaccurately claims \"the scene remains static\" and has \"no discernible movement.\" In the video, although the dolphin board, phone, and other items do not move, there is clear ambient motion that the caption completely overlooks. For instance, the digits on the digital telephone display are visibly changing, counting the seconds. Furthermore, through a window partially visible in the frame, raindrops can be seen streaking down the glass, and the reflection of a flickering overhead light causes subtle, intermittent changes in the brightness on the desk's surface. A more accurate description would acknowledge the stillness of the primary subjects while also chronologically detailing these other movements, such as: \"The objects on the tabletop remain still as the numbers on a digital clock change, while rain falls outside the window and a light flickers overhead.\" This would provide a complete and precise account of all motion within the scene.",
