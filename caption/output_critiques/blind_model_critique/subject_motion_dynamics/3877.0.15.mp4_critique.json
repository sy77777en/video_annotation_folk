    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a mountainous landscape, featuring a steep cliff with a person standing at the top. As the camera moves backward, the Macpac logo appears prominently in the center of the screen. The text 'weather anything' gradually appears below the logo, completing the Macpac advertisement. The background remains consistent, showcasing the rugged mountains and a body of water in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a rugged mountain landscape with a prominent rocky cliff. At the top of the cliff, a person stands, wearing outdoor clothing suitable for hiking, including a jacket and pants, with a neutral color palette. Below, four individuals are climbing the rock face. The person in the middle is wearing gray clothing. The climbers are positioned vertically along the cliff, showcasing their ascent. The scene emphasizes the adventurous nature of the subjects, highlighting their engagement with the challenging terrain.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately describes the static composition of the scene and the appearance of the on-screen graphics, but it critically fails to describe the motion of the human subjects as instructed. The description of the people as \"suspended\" is a state, not an action. In the video, the four individuals hanging from the cliff are not perfectly still; they sway slightly in the wind, their jackets and pants rippling. There is a visible tension in their bodies as they adjust their grips, with small, deliberate movements to maintain their hold. The person at the top is not just \"standing\" but is actively bracing, leaning back with feet planted wide to counterbalance the weight of the chain below. The caption should have focused on these subtle but crucial movements—the slight, collective sway of the human chain, the visible strain and minor adjustments of their limbs, and the rigid, anchored posture of the person at the top—as this motion is the central element of the scene before the camera pulls back. By omitting these details, the caption misses the essence of the action and the physical endurance being depicted.",
