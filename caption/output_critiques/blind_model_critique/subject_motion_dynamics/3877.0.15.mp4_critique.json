    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a wide shot of a mountainous landscape, featuring a steep cliff with a person standing at the top. As the camera moves backward, the Macpac logo appears prominently in the center of the screen. The text 'weather anything' gradually appears below the logo, completing the Macpac advertisement. The background remains consistent, showcasing the rugged mountains and a body of water in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a rugged mountain landscape with a prominent rocky cliff. At the top of the cliff, a person stands, wearing outdoor clothing suitable for hiking, including a jacket and pants, with a neutral color palette. Below, four individuals are climbing the rock face. The person in the middle is wearing gray clothing. The climbers are positioned vertically along the cliff, showcasing their ascent. The scene emphasizes the adventurous nature of the subjects, highlighting their engagement with the challenging terrain.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements and actions in the video:\n*   It starts with a wide shot of a person on a cliff in a mountainous landscape.\n*   It correctly describes the camera's motion (\"moves backward\").\n*   It accurately notes the sequential appearance of the Macpac logo and the text \"weather anything.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is complete, covering the video's entire duration from the opening shot to the final branding reveal. It doesn't miss any significant motion or event.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows the specific rules provided:\n\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in the exact order they occur: person is seen, camera moves, logo appears, text appears.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption correctly identifies that the human subject is static (\"a person standing\") and focuses the description of motion on the camera (\"moves backward\") and the graphical elements (\"logo appears,\" \"text gradually appears\"). This is a perfect execution of the instruction.\n*   **Concise and Objective:** The language is simple, clear, and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives (\"rugged\" is a descriptive term for the terrain, not an emotional one). It avoids speculation or ambiguity.\n*   **Specificity:** It is specific about the actions. Instead of saying \"graphics are shown,\" it details that the \"logo appears\" and the \"text gradually appears.\"\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete actions and avoids interpretive phrases like \"creating a sense of scale\" or \"emphasizing the brand's adventurous spirit.\"\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is factual, sequential, and focused entirely on describing the motion (and lack thereof) within the video.",
