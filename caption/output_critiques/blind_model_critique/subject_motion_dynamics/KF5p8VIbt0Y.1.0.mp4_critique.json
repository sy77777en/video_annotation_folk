    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A white man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a dark suit and white shirt, hangs from the minute hand of a large, round clock face protruding from the side of a brick building. The scene initially appears to be set high above a bustling city street filled with early-model cars and pedestrians. The perspective then changes to reveal that the building facade is a partial set constructed on the rooftop of another building. A mattress is placed on the roof floor beneath the man, and a vintage film camera on a tripod is visible, positioned to film the stunt, creating a forced perspective that makes the man appear to be at a much greater height.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (a man dangling from a clock), the setting (a building facade), and the key event in the video (the camera pulling back to reveal the film set).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete in describing the overall sequence of events. It chronologically outlines the initial tight shot and the subsequent reveal. However, it could be more complete by describing any specific movements the man makes while dangling, if any are visible.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption successfully presents the actions in the correct sequence (\"The scene opens on...\", \"The camera then pulls back...\").\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and informative.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It correctly avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Primary Flaw - Focus on Subject's Motion:** The main instruction is to \"Focus on the subject’s motion.\" The primary subject is the man. However, the caption focuses almost entirely on the **camera's motion** (\"pulls back,\" \"continues to move backward\") and what this motion reveals. The man's action is described with the static verb \"dangling,\" which describes a state rather than a movement. If the man is swinging, kicking, or struggling to hold on, those specific motions are omitted. The caption describes *what is happening* in the scene but fails to describe *what the subject is doing*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good at providing a contextual overview of the scene and the cinematic trick being revealed. However, it **fails to adhere to the core instruction** of focusing on the subject's motion. It prioritizes the camera's movement over the man's actions, which is the opposite of what was requested. A better caption would have described the man's specific movements first, and then explained how the camera's pullback reframes those actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene opens on a man frantically swinging and struggling to maintain his grip on the hand of a large clock on a building facade. As he kicks his legs and shifts his weight to stay balanced, the camera pulls back, revealing that the building is a partial set constructed on a rooftop. The camera continues to move backward, showing a mattress on the roof below the man and the film camera used to create the illusion of great height.",
