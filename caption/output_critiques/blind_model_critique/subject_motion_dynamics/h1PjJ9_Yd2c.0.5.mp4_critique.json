    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A young woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a ponytail sits on a wooden bench in a dimly lit hallway. She is shown in profile, looking toward the right side of the scene. She is wearing a dark, short-sleeved shirt and dark shorts, with her hands resting on her lap.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview, but it could be more precise about the sequence and nature of the woman's movements. The description \"legs, which are shaking\" is vague; a more accurate description might be that her right leg begins to bounce rapidly up and down, a specific motion that starts before she speaks. The current phrasing implies the shaking and speaking begin simultaneously. A more detailed chronological order would be more effective, for example, noting that she first sits still, then her leg starts bouncing, and only after that does she begin to speak. Furthermore, the description of her hands as simply \"resting\" might be an oversimplification. It's plausible she is also fidgeting, perhaps wringing her hands or picking at her fingernails, which are key kinetic details that the current caption omits. Finally, \"speaking as if talking to herself\" could be described more visually, such as \"she begins muttering inaudibly,\" which focuses purely on the observable action of her moving lips.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The young woman initially sits completely still on the bench, maintaining her profile view as she looks toward the doorway on the right. Her right leg then begins to bounce rapidly up and down, a specific motion that starts before she begins to speak. Her hands, rather than simply resting, appear to be fidgeting, possibly wringing or picking at her fingernails. Eventually, she starts muttering inaudibly, her lips moving as if she is talking to herself.",
