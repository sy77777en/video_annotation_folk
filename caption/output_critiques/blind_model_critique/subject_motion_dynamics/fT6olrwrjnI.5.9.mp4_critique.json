    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man in a black and white sports jersey with the number 18, running forward with a determined expression. His eyes are glowing red, and red, vein-like energy surrounds him, highlighting his intense focus and power. The background is plain white, emphasizing the man's actions and the energy around him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video showcases an animated figure wearing a black and white striped sports jersey with the number 18. He has short, dark hair and a determined expression. His eyes are glowing red, and red, vein-like energy surrounds him, highlighting his intense focus and power. The character is depicted in motion, possibly running or charging forward, with his fists clenched and arms bent.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies a man in a specific sports jersey, the action of running, the glowing red eyes, the red energy effect, and the white background.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete in its description of motion. It uses the generic phrase \"running forward,\" which lacks the specificity requested by the instructions (e.g., \"a runner sprints across the finish line\"). It does not provide any detail on the style or speed of the run.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption violates the instructions in the following ways:\n\n*   **Use of Emotional and Subjective Language:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives.\" The caption violates this by using phrases like \"with a determined expression\" and \"intense focus and power,\" which are interpretations of the subject's state rather than objective descriptions.\n*   **Use of Abstract Descriptions:** The instruction says to \"Avoid abstract descriptions.\" The caption includes \"highlighting his intense focus and power\" and \"emphasizing the man's actions,\" which explain the *purpose* or *effect* of the visual elements rather than simply describing the motion itself.\n*   **Lack of Specificity in Motion:** The instruction asks for specific action descriptions (\"sprints across the finish line\") instead of generic ones (\"is running\"). The caption's \"running forward\" is too generic.\n*   **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...,\" which is unnecessary introductory text that should be omitted. The description should begin directly with the subject's action.\n*   **Focus on Interpretation, Not Just Description:** Instead of just describing the red energy, the caption interprets it as a sign of \"power.\" The instructions require describing only what is visibly happening.",
