    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a man with medium brown skin tone and curly black hair, wearing an orange textured outfit. He faces the camera, performing a rap while moving backward as the camera advances. In the foreground, a pair of hands is visible; the left hand holds a white comb, and the right hand holds pink-handled scissors. The man appears animated and expressive, engaging directly with the viewer.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** In a barbershop with a checkered black and white floor and neon lights, a man in an orange sweater is seen moving backward while talking. He gestures with his hands, crossing and uncrossing them as he speaks. The person in front of him holds a comb in the left hand and pink-handled scissors in the right hand, maintaining a steady position throughout the sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption appears to be accurate. It describes specific, observable actions (moving backward, gesturing, holding objects, remaining steady) and attributes them to distinct subjects. The details are concrete and verifiable from a video.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies a main subject (man in orange) and a secondary subject (person with scissors) and describes the motion—or lack thereof—for both. It covers the primary actions within the scene, providing a comprehensive overview.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption excels at describing motion specifically (\"moving backward,\" \"gestures with his hands, crossing and uncrossing them\") and also correctly notes the lack of motion (\"maintaining a steady position\").\n    *   **Clarity and Specificity:** It uses simple, clear language and avoids generic descriptions. \"Crossing and uncrossing\" hands is much better than \"moving his hands.\"\n    *   **Objectivity:** The description is free of emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"he seems nervous,\" \"perhaps they are arguing\").\n    *   **Subject Interaction:** It clearly describes the spatial relationship (\"in front of him\") and the nature of the interaction (one person talking and moving, the other stationary).\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions described (moving, talking, gesturing) appear to be simultaneous, and the caption presents them logically without implying a false sequence.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Inclusion of Setting Details:** The main weakness is the opening clause: \"In a barbershop with a checkered black and white floor and neon lights...\". The instructions explicitly state to **\"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"** Describing the floor and lights is scene-setting, not motion, and should be omitted to make the caption more concise and focused.\n    *   **Passive Voice:** The phrase \"is seen\" is unnecessary and uses a passive voice. The instructions favor direct, active descriptions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. Its core strength is the clear, specific, and objective description of the subjects' motions. However, it violates the instruction to focus purely on motion by including extensive details about the setting at the beginning.\n\n**A revised caption that better adheres to all instructions would be:**\n\nA man in an orange sweater moves backward while talking and gesturing, crossing and uncrossing his hands. The person in front of him holds a comb and scissors, remaining stationary.",
