    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a stationary, high-angle view of a city intersection at night, with traffic moving on the streets below. The camera then pans to the left and moves forward along an elevated pedestrian walkway. As it advances, people walk past in both directions on the walkway, while cars and buses continue to drive on the street level.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately outlines the chronological sequence of camera movements but lacks specificity regarding the motion of the subjects. The initial description of \"traffic moving\" is too general; a more effective caption would describe the nature of this movement, such as \"streams of headlights and taillights flow continuously through the intersection,\" which better captures the visual effect of a busy night scene. Similarly, \"people walk past in both directions\" could be improved by detailing their motion relative to the camera's forward push, for instance, \"silhouetted pedestrians stroll in the opposite direction of the camera, while others walking in the same direction are briefly overtaken.\" The description of the camera's action as \"pans to the left and moves forward\" feels slightly disjointed; imagining a smooth, continuous shot, it would be more precise to describe it as a single fluid motion, such as \"the camera begins a smooth tracking shot that curves to the left, following the walkway's path.\" Finally, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the interplay of light and motion, such as how the car lights create trails on the pavement or how the pedestrians are illuminated by the walkway's lighting as they pass.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a stationary, high-angle view of a city intersection at night, where streams of headlights and taillights flow continuously, creating a dynamic visual of a bustling urban scene. The camera then begins a smooth tracking shot that curves to the left, following the path of an elevated pedestrian walkway. As it advances, silhouetted pedestrians stroll in the opposite direction of the camera, while others walking in the same direction are briefly overtaken. Below, cars and buses continue to drive, their lights creating trails on the pavement. The pedestrians are momentarily illuminated by the walkway's lighting as they pass, adding to the interplay of light and motion in the scene.",
