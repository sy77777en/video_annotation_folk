    "pre_caption": "The man is in a dimly lit industrial setting with metal sheets stacked in the background. As the frames progress, the background begins to change, with the metal sheets appearing to shift and rotate. The lighting also changes, becoming brighter and more intense. The man remains in a similar position throughout, with his arms extended forward, suggesting he is either balancing or reaching out.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man, seen primarily from the back and side, wears a light-colored helmet, a dark grey jacket with lighter grey or white straps forming a harness, and light grey pants. He also wears dark gloves. His arms are often extended forward as if reaching or bracing himself.**",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on your caption is as follows. The caption correctly identifies the main subject and setting, but it lacks specificity regarding the man's motion and includes speculative language. Stating the man \"remains in a similar position\" is too vague; in the video, he is not static but performs a slow, continuous rotation on the spot. The description of his arms as \"extended forward and outstretched widely\" is also imprecise; he holds one arm straight out to his side and the other bent at the elbow in front of his chest, maintaining this pose as he turns. The caption speculates on his intent with \"suggesting he is either balancing or reaching out,\" which should be avoided. Furthermore, the description of the background and lighting is generic. Instead of \"the background begins to change,\" it would be more accurate to state that the large metal sheets behind him pivot in sync with his rotation. The lighting doesn't just become \"brighter\"; rather, a moving spotlight tracks the man, while other colored lights sweep across the pivoting metal sheets, creating shifting reflections and shadows throughout the space. The caption should focus first on the man's specific, continuous rotational movement and then describe the concurrent, dynamic changes in the background panels and lighting.",
