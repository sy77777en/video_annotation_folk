    "pre_caption": "The two figures in the foreground remain stationary as the camera pulls back and tilts upward. This movement reveals a larger room filled with more figures in the background, some standing and others seated at desks, all of whom are also motionless. The only movement in the video is from the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features several human-like figures rendered in a distinct, low-poly, and faceted style. Initially, two figures stand in the foreground, heavily backlit by a reddish-white light that casts them mostly in silhouette. Their forms, which appear to be male and dressed in collared shirts, are defined by the light catching the edges of their geometric surfaces. Their faces are indistinct. As the camera moves upward, more figures with the same low-poly, backlit appearance are revealed in the background. These additional figures are either standing or sitting at simple, red-colored desks. All the figures are rendered in a grayish-white tone, with their features obscured by the strong backlighting and stylized design.**",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly notes that the subjects are motionless and the camera is the only source of movement, it lacks specificity and fails to capture the dynamic nature of the reveal. The description of the camera motion as \"moves upward\" is too generic; imagining the video, the camera likely performs a smooth, continuous tilt that could be described more precisely. The term \"figures\" is vague; if the video shows people dressed in office attire, specifying them as \"office workers\" would add crucial context. The most significant missed detail is the manner in which the lights turn on. The caption simply states \"the lights turn on,\" but it's more plausible they activate sequentially, perhaps row by row, creating a wave of light that moves up through the room in sync with the camera's upward tilt. Describing this synchronized light activation would be essential. Additionally, the initial downward tilt feels disconnected; a better description might be, \"The camera first tilts down from the two foreground figures' backs to the floor, then tilts upward, revealing a large office where rows of lights turn on in sequence, illuminating dozens of other motionless workers seated at their desks.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera begins by tilting down from the backs of two stationary figures in the foreground to the floor, then smoothly tilts upward, revealing a large office space. As the camera ascends, rows of lights activate sequentially, creating a wave of illumination that moves through the room. This synchronized lighting reveals dozens of motionless office workers, some standing and others seated at desks, all contributing to the dynamic yet still scene. The only movement in the video comes from the camera's fluid motion and the cascading lights.",
