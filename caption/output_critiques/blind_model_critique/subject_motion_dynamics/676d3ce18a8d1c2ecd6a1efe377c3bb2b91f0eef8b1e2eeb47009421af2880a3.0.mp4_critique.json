  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption accurately describes the visual elements present in what appears to be a static video: an aerial view of a church, a graveyard, a path, and surrounding trees. The final sentence correctly identifies the lack of motion by stating the camera remains steady.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete in that it identifies the main subjects and correctly notes the absence of movement.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption **fails** to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion vs. Appearance:** The primary instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\" The caption does the exact opposite. It dedicates almost the entire paragraph to describing the static appearance of the church (\"long, pointed spire,\" \"series of windows\"), the graveyard (\"numerous gravestones\"), and the landscape. This violates the core principle of the task.\n*   **Conciseness for Static Videos:** The instructions state, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail\" and for scenery shots, \"briefly note this in one to three sentences.\" The provided caption is six sentences long and goes into excessive, forbidden detail about the scene's appearance.\n*   **Purpose of the Caption:** The goal is to describe motion. Since there is no motion, the caption should be a very brief statement to that effect. Instead, it functions as a detailed scenic description, which is explicitly what the instructions aim to avoid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good**. While factually accurate, it fundamentally misunderstands the assignment's core requirements. It focuses heavily on describing the static appearance of the scene, which is explicitly forbidden, and is far too long and detailed for a video with no movement.\n\nA correct caption, following all instructions, would be much shorter, such as:\n\n\"The video shows a static aerial view of a church and the surrounding graveyard, with no movement from any subjects or the camera.\"",
