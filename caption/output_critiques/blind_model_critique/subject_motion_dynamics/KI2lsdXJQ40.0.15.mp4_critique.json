    "pre_caption": "Several cars move along a multi-lane road. The vehicles travel in the same direction, maintaining a steady pace. One car navigates through a series of traffic cones, indicating a possible lane change or maneuver around an obstacle. The scene is set against a backdrop of a stone wall and trees, with no significant changes in speed or direction among the cars.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the events in a hypothetical video. It correctly identifies the subjects (cars), their collective movement, and a specific action performed by one car (navigating cones).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption covers the essential motions: the general flow of traffic and the specific maneuver of one vehicle. It provides a complete, high-level summary of the activity.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows several instructions well but fails on one critical point and has minor areas for improvement.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented as concurrent, which is appropriate.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or abstract language (e.g., \"emphasizing its speed\").\n    *   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The language used is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Specificity:** It describes a specific action (\"navigates through a series of traffic cones\") rather than a generic one.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The primary issue is the use of speculative language. The instruction explicitly states to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" The phrase \"**indicating a possible lane change or maneuver**\" directly violates this rule by guessing the reason for the action instead of simply describing the action itself.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption includes the sentence, \"The scene is set against a backdrop of a stone wall and trees...\" This describes the static background, which detracts from the instruction to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\"\n    *   **Conciseness:** The first two sentences (\"Several cars move along a multi-lane road. The vehicles travel in the same direction, maintaining a steady pace.\") could be combined for better conciseness. For example: \"Several cars travel in the same direction at a steady pace along a multi-lane road.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is good in its clarity and objectivity but fails to adhere to the strict instruction against speculation. It could also be improved by removing the description of the static background to focus entirely on motion.",
