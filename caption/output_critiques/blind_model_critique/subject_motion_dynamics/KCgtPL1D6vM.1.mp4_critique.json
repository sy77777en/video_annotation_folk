  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant error and a few areas for minor improvement.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of a stationary camera capturing a hilly street with a tram passing by is likely accurate for the video.\n*   **Inaccurate Detail:** The caption includes \"in Lisbon, Portugal.\" This is a major violation of the instruction: \"Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain.\" Unless the city's name is explicitly shown in the video, this is an assumption based on external knowledge and should be omitted.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Good:** The caption successfully identifies the main elements: the static nature of the shot and the primary motion of the tram.\n*   **Could be more specific:** The description of the tram's motion as \"passing by\" is a bit generic. It could be improved by specifying the direction of movement (e.g., \"moves from left to right across the frame\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It correctly identifies the primary motion (the tram) and also notes the lack of camera motion (\"The camera remains stationary\").\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The description is brief and to the point.\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Clarity:** The language is simple and easy to understand.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violates \"Visible Content Only\" Rule:** As mentioned, including \"Lisbon, Portugal\" is a direct violation of the instructions.\n    *   **Slightly Meta-Descriptive:** The phrase \"The primary motion in the scene is...\" describes the video's composition rather than directly describing the action itself. The instructions favor direct action descriptions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is generally well-written but fails on the critical instruction to only describe what is visible. By including the location, it introduces information that cannot be confirmed from the video alone.\n\n**A better caption that strictly follows all instructions would be:**\n\nFrom a stationary viewpoint, the video shows a narrow, hilly street with tram tracks. A white and yellow tram enters the frame from one side and travels across the foreground before exiting the other side.",
