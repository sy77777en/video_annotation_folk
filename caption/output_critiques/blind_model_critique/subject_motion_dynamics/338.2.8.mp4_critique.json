    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a woman in a yellow patterned top holding chopsticks and eating from a plate of food, with a glass of iced tea in front of her. The camera then pans to the right, revealing a man in a maroon shirt also holding chopsticks and eating. As the camera continues to move, it shows another woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a black top, eating from her plate. Finally, the camera focuses on a woman with glasses, wearing a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, who is also holding chopsticks and eating from her plate. The background features a dimly lit restaurant with traditional decor, including a large painting on the wall and a hanging lantern.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should first describe the first subject’s motion and dynamics, followed by the second’s.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a complex focus transition in a dining setting. Initially, the subject is a woman with medium-length dark hair, glasses, and a light brown skin tone, wearing a yellow patterned top and holding chopsticks over a plate of food. The focus then shifts to a man with glasses wearing a maroon shirt. Following this, it transitions to a woman with long dark hair and glasses, dressed in a maroon vest over a black top. Finally, the focus is on a woman with glasses, wearing a maroon vest with gold trim over a white shirt, and her name tag reads \"Susan.\" She has a light brown skin tone and is holding chopsticks in front of a plate with green vegetables. A glass of iced tea is visible on the table. The transitions between individuals occur smoothly, suggesting a deliberate shift in focus.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to the core instructions, primarily by focusing on static appearance and background details rather than the subjects' specific motions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is inadequate:\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a plausible video scene: a camera panning across four people eating at a restaurant. It is complete in that it describes all the visible subjects and the setting.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Where the Caption Fails:**\n\n1.  **Incorrect Focus:** The main instruction is to \"Focus on the subject's motion.\" This caption dedicates the majority of its word count to describing static details: what each person is wearing (\"yellow patterned top,\" \"maroon vest with gold trim\"), their accessories (\"glasses\"), and the background decor (\"dimly lit restaurant with traditional decor, including a large painting on the wall and a hanging lantern\"). This violates the core principle of the task.\n2.  **Excessive Appearance Details:** The instructions state to \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Since the camera reveals each person sequentially, they are already differentiated by the chronological order of the pan. The extensive descriptions of their clothing are unnecessary and distract from the motion.\n3.  **Generic Action Description:** The instruction asks to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\" The repeated phrase \"holding chopsticks and eating\" is a generic description. A better caption would describe the specific action, such as \"lifts food to their mouth with chopsticks\" or \"picks up a piece of food from the plate.\"\n4.  **Unnecessary Background Detail:** The entire last sentence is dedicated to the background. While context is useful, the instructions emphasize subject motion. A brief mention of the setting would suffice, but a detailed description of the decor is contrary to the goal.\n\n**Where the Caption Succeeds:**\n\n1.  **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly describes the camera's movement and reveals the subjects in the correct chronological sequence.\n2.  **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language, using simple and clear English as requested.\n3.  **Camera Motion:** It correctly identifies and describes the camera's motion (\"pans to the right,\" \"continues to move,\" \"focuses on\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the caption is factually accurate and follows a chronological structure, it fundamentally misunderstands the assignment's primary goal. It functions more as a general scene description than a motion-focused one. A good caption, according to the instructions, would have minimized the descriptions of clothing and background and provided a more specific account of *how* the subjects were moving and interacting with their food.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video starts with a woman using chopsticks to lift food to her mouth, a glass of iced tea in front of her. The camera pans right to show a man picking up a piece of food with chopsticks. As the camera continues, it reveals another woman with long dark hair, using chopsticks to bring food to her mouth. Finally, the camera focuses on a woman with glasses, deftly maneuvering her chopsticks to eat. The setting is a dimly lit restaurant with traditional decor.",
