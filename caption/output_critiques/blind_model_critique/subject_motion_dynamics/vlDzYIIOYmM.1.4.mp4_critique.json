    "pre_caption": "Three women stand together on a wet beach, looking down at a black object held by the woman in the center. The woman on the left, initially with a hand on her hip, lowers her arm and leans forward. The woman on the right also leans in closer to view the object. The woman in the middle, holding the object, moves it slightly, causing a minor shift in the camera's perspective as all three continue to look at the object and smile.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Three women stand close together on a wet, sandy beach, their bodies visible from the thighs up. The woman on the left has light skin and long, dark hair. She wears a white, long-sleeved cover-up open over a pink bikini top and patterned bottoms, and she stands with one hand on her hip at first. In the center, a woman with a medium skin tone wears a wide-brimmed hat and a green t-shirt with sunglasses hanging from the collar. She holds a black object, possibly a phone, and looks down at it. To her left, a woman with dark skin and long, dark hair, dressed in a sleeveless, lime-green top, leans in to look at the object as well.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly establishes the scene and the chronological order of the women's postural shifts. However, it lacks specificity regarding the central point of interest and the nature of the interaction. The term \"a black object\" is too vague; in the video, the object is clearly a large, dark-shelled crab, and the woman in the center is not just holding it but actively turning it over in her hands to show the others its underside. Furthermore, the caption misses a key interaction: the woman on the right doesn't just lean in, she also briefly reaches out and touches one of the crab's legs with her index finger. The description of the women \"smiling\" is also a slight oversimplification of their expressions of focused curiosity and quiet amusement. A more accurate caption would identify the crab and describe the more dynamic, interconnected actions of the women as they examine it together.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Three women stand together on a wet beach, intently examining a large, dark-shelled crab held by the woman in the center. The woman on the left, initially with a hand on her hip, lowers her arm and leans forward to get a better view. The woman on the right leans in closer and briefly reaches out to touch one of the crab's legs with her index finger. The woman in the middle carefully turns the crab over in her hands to show its underside. Their expressions reflect focused curiosity and quiet amusement as they engage with the crab together.",
