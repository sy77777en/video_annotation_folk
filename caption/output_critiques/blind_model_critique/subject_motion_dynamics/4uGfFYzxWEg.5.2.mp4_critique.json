    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A light gray sedan is shown from a high angle in a dimly lit environment. Inside the car, two people are visible in the front seats; the person in the driver's seat is wearing a reddish-purple top. A large, green, glowing, three-dimensional British pound symbol (£) materializes and hovers directly above the car's roof.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject (a British pound symbol) and the secondary subject (a sedan). It accurately describes the motion of the primary subject (\"materializes and hovers\") and the state of the secondary subject (\"stationary\"). The descriptive details (\"large, green, glowing, three-dimensional,\" \"light gray\") are factual and precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete and captures all essential motion within the video. It describes the appearance of the symbol, its subsequent action, and the state of the car, leaving out no critical information about the movement.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption perfectly follows all the given rules:\n    *   **Chronological Order:** It correctly presents the actions in sequence: the symbol first \"materializes\" and then \"hovers.\"\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, clear sentence that effectively communicates the entire event.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** The core of the description is built around the verbs \"materializes,\" \"hovers,\" and the adjective \"stationary,\" which directly address the motion.\n    *   **Specific Actions:** It uses precise verbs. \"Materializes\" is a much better choice than \"appears,\" as it specifically describes something forming into existence. \"Hovers\" is also a specific description of its stable position in the air.\n    *   **No Subjectivity or Speculation:** The language is entirely objective and avoids emotional words, ambiguity (\"appears to be\"), or abstract concepts.\n    *   **Describes Subject Interaction:** It clearly defines the spatial relationship and interaction between the two subjects: the symbol hovers *above the roof* of the stationary car.",
