    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In a dimly lit setting, a stop-motion figure of a young girl with brown skin sits cross-legged on the floor in the middleground. She has long, dark hair styled in two braids and wears a simple, light-colored sleeveless dress. Her most distinct feature is her face, which has large, round, button-like eyes. She holds an open book in her lap and a thin stick in her hand. In the background and out of focus, another stop-motion figure of an older woman is seated. This figure wears an orange garment, and her facial features are similarly stylized with a long face and round eyes.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the primary and secondary subjects and their general actions, but it lacks the specificity needed to fully capture the motion. The description of the girl's hand moving the stick \"slightly around the ground\" is too vague; a more informative caption would describe the actual motion, such as \"traces a small circle in the dirt with the stick\" or \"taps the stick rhythmically on the ground.\" Similarly, the background woman \"works on a task\" is an inference rather than a description of movement. It would be better to describe the visible motion, for instance, \"repeatedly moves her hands in a circular, stirring motion\" or \"folds and unfolds a piece of fabric.\" Lastly, the interaction with the book is minimal. If the video shows it, the caption could be improved by mentioning if her head tilts, if her eyes shift incrementally across the page, or if a page is turned, as these details would provide a much clearer picture of the stop-motion animation.",
