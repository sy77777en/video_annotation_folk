    "pre_caption": "A woman is standing on a skateboard, positioned on the ledge of a tall building. She is wearing a white tank top, light-colored pants, and a knitted cap, highlighting her focus on safety and style. Notably, she has a prosthetic right leg. She is balanced on the skateboard, which is oriented parallel to the building's windows. The background shows a cityscape with various buildings and a clear sky, indicating a high altitude. The woman maintains a steady stance, facing forward, with a confident posture.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Since this represents the first and last frames of a video, refer to it as 'The video' instead of mentioning 'image' or 'frame.' Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames rather than separately. Focus on the setting and scenery rather than detailed subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a woman standing on a skateboard, positioned on the ledge of a tall building. She is wearing a white tank top, light-colored pants, and a knitted cap, highlighting her focus on safety and style. Notably, she has a prosthetic right leg. She is balanced on the skateboard, which is oriented parallel to the building's windows. The setting is urban, with a cityscape visible in the reflection of the windows, indicating a high altitude. The woman maintains a steady stance, facing forward, with a confident posture.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subject and setting but is too static and lacks a clear, chronological description of the motion. The phrase \"making a slight forward movement\" is vague and doesn't capture the sequence of actions likely shown. For example, the video might show the woman first placing her front foot on the board, then pushing off the ledge with her back foot to initiate a slow roll from left to right along the building's edge. The caption should describe this progression of movement. It also misses key details about *how* she balances, such as extending her arms out to her sides or making subtle weight shifts with her upper body as the skateboard moves. Finally, the caption includes subjective interpretations like \"highlighting her focus on safety and style\" and \"confident posture,\" which should be omitted in favor of a purely objective description of her physical actions.",
