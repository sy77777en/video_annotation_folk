    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A worn, dark brown teddy bear is the central subject. The plush bear has a fuzzy, slightly matted texture and visible stitching, giving it an aged appearance. It features mismatched eyes: one is a large, dark, four-holed button, while the other is a smaller, dark bead. A brown, flat, round bead forms its nose. Around its neck is a faded pink scarf tied in a knot. A light-skinned human hand places a dark gray, soft cap on the bear's head. The cap, made of a fabric or leather-like material with prominent stitching, complements the bear's button eye.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (teddy bear, hand), the object (cap), and the sequence of events. The description of the hand entering from the top, placing the cap, and then exiting is a precise representation of the visible actions.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is complete. It covers all the key movements in the video from start to finish: the initial placement and focusing of the bear, the entrance of the hand, the interaction with the cap, and the hand's departure. No significant motion is omitted.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n*   **Chronological Order:** It perfectly follows the timeline of events: the bear is placed, then the hand enters, places the cap, and leaves.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is entirely focused on actions (\"is set down,\" \"comes into focus,\" \"enters,\" \"places,\" \"moving out of view\") rather than static appearance.\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple, natural, and gets straight to the point without unnecessary words.\n*   **Objectivity:** It is entirely objective, avoiding emotional adjectives, speculation (\"it seems to\"), or ambiguity.\n*   **Specificity:** It provides specific details about the interaction (\"places a dark gray cap on the bear's head\") and the subject's movement (\"enters the frame from the top\").\n*   **Subject Handling:** It correctly describes the motion of the primary subject (the bear) and the secondary, interacting subject (the hand), including how the hand enters and exits the frame.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, clear, and perfectly aligned with the video's content.",
