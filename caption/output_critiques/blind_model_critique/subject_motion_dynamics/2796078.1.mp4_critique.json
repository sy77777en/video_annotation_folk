    "pre_caption": "A woman with curly brown hair, wearing a beige jacket, is holding a small dog with curly fur and a floral bandana. She begins to walk to the left, gradually moving out of the frame. The background shows an outdoor seating area with wooden chairs and tables, and a building with large windows and a decorative wall. As the woman and the dog exit the frame, the focus shifts to the empty outdoor setting, highlighting the chairs and tables.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a woman facing to the left side of the frame, holding a small dog with curly fur. She has curly brown hair tied back with a clip and is wearing a beige jacket. As the video progresses, the woman and the dog move out of the frame, revealing an outdoor setting with wooden chairs and tables, and a backdrop of greenery and a building with large windows.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Failures in Adhering to Instructions\n\n1.  **Focus on Appearance, Not Motion:** The biggest issue is that the caption dedicates its entire first sentence to describing the subjects' appearance (\"A woman with curly brown hair, wearing a beige jacket... a small dog with curly fur and a floral bandana\"). The instructions explicitly state: \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details\" and \"Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects.\" Since there are no other subjects to differentiate from, these details are unnecessary and directly violate the core rules.\n\n2.  **Lack of Conciseness:** Due to the inclusion of unnecessary appearance and background details, the caption is not concise. The instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative description,\" but a significant portion of the text is dedicated to static descriptions rather than the action itself.\n\n3.  **Excessive Background Description:** The caption describes the background in detail (\"an outdoor seating area with wooden chairs and tables, and a building with large windows and a decorative wall\") before the main action is even complete. While the background becomes the focus at the end, this level of detail at the beginning distracts from the primary subject's motion.\n\n### Aspects That Follow the Instructions\n\n1.  **Chronological Order:** The caption correctly describes the events in the order they happen: the woman is holding the dog, she walks, she exits the frame, and the focus shifts to the empty scene.\n\n2.  **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids emotional, subjective, or speculative language (e.g., \"might be,\" \"appears\").\n\n3.  **Specific Action:** The description of the movement (\"walk to the left, gradually moving out of the frame\") is clear and specific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite getting the chronological order and tone right, the caption is fundamentally flawed because it prioritizes descriptive details of appearance over the required focus on motion. A good caption would have omitted the descriptions of the woman's hair, jacket, and the dog's fur to create a concise, motion-focused paragraph.",
