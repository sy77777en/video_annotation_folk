    "pre_caption": "The video shows a young man with curly dark hair in close-up. He remains still, with a focused expression and wide-open eyes, suggesting attentiveness or surprise. The lighting shifts from a warm tone to a red hue, highlighting his facial features and casting shadows that emphasize his expression. His face is slightly tilted, adding to the intensity of his gaze. There is no movement from the subject throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a young man with curly dark hair, captured in close-up. He has a focused expression, with his eyes wide open, suggesting attentiveness or surprise. The lighting changes from a warm tone to a red hue, highlighting his facial features and casting shadows that emphasize his expression. His face is slightly tilted, adding to the intensity of his gaze, though the top he is wearing is not clearly visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe factual descriptions (a young man, close-up, remains still, lighting shifts from warm to red) appear to be accurate based on the caption's content.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption correctly identifies the main subject and the most significant event (the lighting change) in the absence of subject motion.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates multiple core instructions:\n\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The instruction is to \"Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives\" and \"Avoid speculative statements.\" The caption includes several violations:\n    *   \"...suggesting attentiveness or surprise.\" (This is a speculative interpretation of the subject's mental state).\n    *   \"...adding to the intensity of his gaze.\" (This is a subjective and interpretive description).\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Abstract Descriptions\":** The instruction explicitly forbids abstract descriptions like \"emphasizing its speed and agility.\" The caption contains similar abstract statements about the effect of the lighting:\n    *   \"...highlighting his facial features...\"\n    *   \"...casting shadows that emphasize his expression.\"\n\n*   **Violation of Conciseness for \"No Movement\":** The instruction states, \"If the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\" The provided caption is overly detailed, describing the subject's expression, the tilt of his head, and the effect of the shadows, which goes against the instruction to be brief.\n\n*   **Violation of Focus:** The instructions require the caption to focus on motion. While correctly noting the lack of motion, the caption then shifts its focus to static details of appearance (\"curly dark hair,\" \"focused expression,\" \"face is slightly tilted\") and subjective interpretations, which the instructions advise against.\n\n### A Better Caption Example:\n\nA better caption that adheres to all instructions would be:\n\nA young man in a close-up shot remains still throughout the video. The lighting on his face shifts from a warm tone to a red hue.",
