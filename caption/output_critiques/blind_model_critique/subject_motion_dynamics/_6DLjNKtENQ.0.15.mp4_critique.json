    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A dark-skinned woman with long, dark, wavy hair is seated in a helicopter seat, facing the left side of the frame. She wears a dark textured jacket over a lighter top and a headset with a microphone, and her right hand rests on a control device. She is speaking continuously as she turns her head left towards the camera, her eyes widening and mouth opening slightly as she looks at a partially visible light-skinned man on the right side of the frame. The man, seen mostly from the side and back of his head, has short, light-colored hair, a visible tattoo on his neck/shoulder area, and wears a light-colored t-shirt and a headset with a microphone. He is seated to her left.**",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is as follows:\n\nThe caption accurately captures the chronological sequence of the subjects' head movements and facial expressions, but it misses key contextual motion that would be present in the video. A primary omission is the movement of the helicopter itself; the description of the cityscape background is static, whereas in a video, it would be visibly moving to indicate flight, which is a crucial aspect of the scene's motion. Furthermore, the description of the woman's hand being \"on the control device\" is too general. A more precise description would specify if she is merely resting her hand on the cyclic stick, gripping it firmly, or making a specific input, especially since her expression changes dramatically. Similarly, the caption fails to mention what the pilot is doing with his own hands, which would almost certainly be on the flight controls. Finally, the cause of the woman's reaction is left ambiguous; the caption implies she is reacting to the man, but it's equally plausible she is reacting to something she sees out of his side window as she turns her head. Clarifying the target of her gaze at the moment her eyes widen would provide a more accurate account of the event.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The woman, wearing a headset, is seated in the co-pilot seat of a helicopter, with her right hand gripping the cyclic stick as the helicopter flies over a cityscape, the buildings below moving swiftly past. She is speaking and gradually turns her head to the right, her eyes widening as she looks either at the man beside her or something outside his side window. The man, also wearing a headset and with a tattoo on his neck, is seated in the pilot seat, his hands steady on the flight controls. The dynamic cityscape outside underscores the helicopter's motion, adding to the intensity of the scene.",
