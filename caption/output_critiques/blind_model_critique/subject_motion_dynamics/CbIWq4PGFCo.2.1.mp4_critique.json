    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A man with short, dark brown hair is seen from the back, facing away from the viewer. He is wearing a black t-shirt and appears to be sitting or kneeling while looking out at a distant, blurry landscape. His ears and the back of his neck are visible, and his posture remains still throughout the video.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is overly simplistic and likely misses crucial visual dynamics that give the video its meaning. While the man's posture may be static, the statement that he is \"completely still\" with \"no discernible movement\" is probably inaccurate, as it overlooks subtle actions like blinking, breathing, or the movement of his hair and clothing in a breeze. The description also fails to capture the essential contrast between the subject's stillness and the motion in his environment, such as passing traffic, falling leaves, or churning water below him. Furthermore, the caption completely omits any camera movement; for instance, a slow zoom-in on the man's face or a pan across the scene would be a key part of the video's motion that is not described. Finally, \"gazes downward\" is too vague; a more informative caption would specify what he is looking at if it is visible, as this would provide critical context for his static state.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The man stands with a calm and steady posture, his subtle movements like blinking and breathing adding a quiet dynamism as his hair and clothing gently sway in the breeze. He gazes downward, focusing intently on the bustling traffic below, while the scene around him is alive with motion—leaves fluttering to the ground and water churning in the distance. The camera slowly zooms in on his contemplative expression, capturing the contrast between his stillness and the vibrant activity of his surroundings.",
