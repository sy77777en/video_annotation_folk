    "pre_caption": "A large herd of animals is seen moving together in a barren, sparsely vegetated landscape. The animals are densely packed, and their movement is synchronized as they traverse the area. The background is a dry, open field with patches of dry grass scattered across the ground. The herd maintains a consistent formation throughout the sequence, indicating a coordinated movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the description.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. Briefly describe the salient motions and dynamics of the primary subjects while providing a concise overview of secondary movements, or describe all subjects' collective motion if that is more appropriate.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy**\nThe caption accurately describes a scene with a large herd of animals moving in a barren landscape. It correctly identifies that they are densely packed and moving in a coordinated manner.\n\n**Completeness**\nThe caption is incomplete because it fails to describe the specific type of motion. It uses generic terms like \"moving together\" and \"traverse the area\" but does not specify *how* the animals are moving (e.g., walking, running, trotting, galloping). This leaves out an essential detail about the action.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction**\nThe caption does not adhere well to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The caption fails on this primary instruction. It dedicates two full sentences to describing the static background (\"barren, sparsely vegetated landscape,\" \"dry, open field with patches of dry grass\"), which violates the rule to \"Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions.\"\n*   **Action Specificity:** The caption violates the instruction to \"specify how they move rather than using generic descriptions.\" \"Moving together\" is a generic description, similar to the example \"birds are flying,\" which the instructions advise against. A better description would specify the gait of the animals.\n*   **Conciseness and Redundancy:** The caption is not concise. It contains redundant information. For example, stating the \"movement is synchronized\" and later that the herd \"maintains a consistent formation... indicating a coordinated movement\" describes the same concept twice.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The use of the passive voice (\"is seen moving\") is less direct and natural than the active voice (\"moves\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is poor because it focuses too much on the scenery and uses vague, repetitive language to describe the motion, failing to provide the specific, action-oriented details required by the instructions.",
