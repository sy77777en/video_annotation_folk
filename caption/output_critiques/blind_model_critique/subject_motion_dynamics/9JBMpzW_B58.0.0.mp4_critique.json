  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the key visual elements, but it violates several core instructions. It uses speculative language (\"possibly the aurora borealis or australis\") and subjective adjectives (\"stunning,\" \"breathtaking,\" \"ethereal\"), which are explicitly forbidden. The most significant omission is the motion of the viewpoint itself; a video from a ship's bow would show the vessel pitching and rolling on the waves, causing the horizon to continuously rise and fall within the frame, a primary motion that is not mentioned. Furthermore, the description of the sky's movement is too generic. Instead of \"sweep across the frame,\" it should specify the direction of the celestial rotation (e.g., \"the stars rotate in an arc from left to right\"). Similarly, \"dances and shimmers\" could be more precise by describing how the aurora's light forms, expands, or changes shape, such as \"a green aurora brightens and fades in vertical bands along the horizon.\" Finally, stating that it is a \"timelapse\" and then later explaining \"The timelapse effect causes...\" is redundant; the description of the accelerated motion should be integrated directly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This timelapse video captures the night sky from the bow of a large ship at sea. The sky is filled with countless stars, and a green aurora brightens and fades in vertical bands along the horizon beneath a layer of clouds. The ship's movement causes the horizon to continuously rise and fall within the frame as the vessel pitches and rolls on the waves. The stars rotate in an arc from left to right, and the aurora's light changes shape, all at an accelerated speed due to the timelapse effect.",
