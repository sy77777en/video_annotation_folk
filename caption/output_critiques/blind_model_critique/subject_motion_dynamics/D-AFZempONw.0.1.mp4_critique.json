    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical motion, posture, or anatomy**, so the description should reflect this.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A slender man with pale, mottled skin is shown wearing a metallic mask that covers most of his face, including a white section around his open mouth and nose area. He is restrained by a shackle around his chest and upper back. A large apparatus is attached to his back, from which numerous thick, ribbed tubes extend. These tubes initially appear gray, transition to a glowing, neon green, and then revert back to gray. An additional connection is visible in the middle of these tubes. Four tubes are connected together at the top of his head, and one tube extends from each shoulder. His arms are covered near the elbows with large black devices.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates a key instruction, although it follows most others correctly.\n\n### Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events. The actions—tensing, glowing, light traveling, and a head jerk—are specific, observable, and create a clear picture of the motion in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete, capturing the entire sequence of motion in a logical flow. It starts with the subject's initial action and follows the subsequent effects on the connected tubes and the subject's body.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:**\n        *   **Chronological Order:** The actions are presented in a clear chronological sequence: the figure tenses, the tubes glow, the glow travels, and the head jerks.\n        *   **Focus on Motion:** The caption excels at describing specific motions (\"tenses and strains,\" \"glow...travel up,\" \"head jerks\") rather than static appearances.\n        *   **Object Interaction:** It clearly describes the interaction between the figure and the tubes, detailing how the glow moves through them.\n        *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is contained in a single, coherent paragraph using simple language.\n\n    *   **Weaknesses:**\n        *   **Speculative Language:** The primary failure is the use of the phrase \"**appears to travel**.\" The instructions explicitly state to \"Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.'\" This phrase introduces uncertainty where the instruction demands a definitive description of what is visible. A correct phrasing would be \"The glow travels up the length of the tubes.\"\n\nBecause it violates a direct negative constraint, the caption is not considered good. It could be easily corrected by removing the speculative phrase.",
