    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **From a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night-vision display, a person wearing white gloves holds a dark-colored firearm. The weapon is equipped with a large, boxy holographic sight on its top rail. A digital heads-up display is superimposed on the view, indicating an ammunition count of 13 in the magazine and 90 in reserve. The person is positioned near a large, cylindrical hay bale in a dark, outdoor setting. In the background, additional hay bales and the silhouettes of several pine trees are visible.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the basic sequence of events, but it could be more precise and chronologically clear. The phrase \"The firearm is raised at the beginning of the scene\" is ambiguous; in the video, the firearm likely starts in a low-ready position and is then actively *brought up* into the line of sight *after* the initial pan to the right, not just passively \"raised\" at the start. The description of the action as the firearm \"moves closer to align the holographic sight\" is a bit simplistic. Visually, this is a distinct motion where the entire perspective shifts to look through the optic, with the background blurring slightly and the sight's reticle becoming the clear focal point, an action more accurately described as \"aiming down the sight.\" Finally, stating that the \"view then holds steady\" lacks important context. In the video, the steady view is purposeful, with the holographic reticle held firmly on a specific target downrange, which is a key detail of the action that is currently omitted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a first-person perspective, panning slightly upward and to the right. Initially, the firearm is in a low-ready position. The person then actively brings the firearm up into the line of sight, aligning the holographic sight with their eye. As the perspective shifts to look through the optic, the background blurs slightly, and the sight's reticle becomes the clear focal point, accurately depicting the action of aiming down the sight. The view then holds steady, with the holographic reticle firmly fixed on a specific target downrange, highlighting the precision of the aim.",
