    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A middle-aged white woman with shoulder-length brown hair and bangs moves towards the left side of the frame as she speaks. She is wearing a dark, patterned, sleeveless V-neck top with a small microphone clipped to the neckline. She accessorizes with a simple necklace, a watch, and a ring on her left hand. She gestures with her hands while talking, holding a small black object, possibly a presentation remote, in her right hand.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subject's basic actions, but it lacks precision and a clear chronological flow, making the sequence of movements feel disjointed. For instance, the video likely shows the woman gesturing *while* walking across the stage, rather than these being two separate events. The description of her movement—walking left while facing left and then turning to face right—is physically awkward and probably misinterprets the action; it's more likely she walks across the stage while facing forward toward an audience before turning. Furthermore, the \"small black object\" is probably a presentation remote, and a crucial detail is likely missing: the caption doesn't mention if she uses it to interact with anything, such as clicking it to change a slide on a large screen that is probably visible behind her. Similarly, her gesture of pointing upward is likely directed at a specific point on that unseen screen, an interaction that would give her motion purpose but is currently omitted. A better description would integrate these actions, for example, by noting that she walks across the stage, clicks the remote to change a slide, and then gestures toward the new information on the screen.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman walks across the stage while facing forward toward the audience, speaking and gesturing with her hands. She holds a presentation remote in her right hand, which she uses to click and change a slide on the large screen behind her. As the new slide appears, she raises her right hand, pointing her index finger upward to emphasize a specific point on the screen, seamlessly integrating her movements with her presentation.",
