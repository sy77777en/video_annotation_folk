    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A dark-colored, military-style helicopter, featuring a prominent front windshield and a large circular engine intake on its left side (viewer's left), is shown landing in a dimly lit setting. A bright spotlight, mounted on the helicopter's right side near the cockpit (viewer's right), illuminates the scene. Inside the cockpit, a helmeted pilot is partially visible. As the helicopter settles, a person in dark attire, possibly tactical gear, disembarks from its side.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a plausible sequence of events involving a helicopter and a person. It correctly identifies the helicopter as stationary and describes the actions of its components (spotlight, door) and the person.\n*   **Completeness:** It captures all the key actions in the scene without leaving out important movements. The description flows from the first action (spotlight) to the last (person stepping out), providing a complete picture of the motion.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Chronological Order:** The caption perfectly follows this rule. It clearly states the spotlight turns on, \"then\" the door opens, and finally, the person exits.\n    *   **Focus on Motion:** It excels at describing actions (\"turns on, casting a beam,\" \"opens,\" \"exits... stepping onto\") rather than just static descriptions.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand. It avoids jargon and gets straight to the point.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The description is entirely objective, avoiding emotional adjectives (\"dramatic exit\") or speculative phrases (\"it looks like\").\n    *   **Specificity:** The actions are described with good detail. Instead of \"a light comes on,\" it says \"a spotlight... turns on, casting a beam of light forward.\" Instead of \"a person gets out,\" it specifies \"a person exits the aircraft, stepping onto the ground.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is concise, informative, chronologically accurate, and objectively focused on the specific motions within the video.",
