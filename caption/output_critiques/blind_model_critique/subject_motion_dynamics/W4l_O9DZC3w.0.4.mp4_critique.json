    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Atop a large, spherical nest composed of interwoven dry brown twigs and grass, a man and a woman are kissing. The woman, on the left, has long, reddish-brown hair and a fair complexion. She is wearing a reddish-brown top with green accents and red fishnet stockings. The man, to her right, has dark, curly hair, a darker complexion, and is dressed in a white tank top and blue jeans. They are both perched on the nest, leaning toward the right in an embrace.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects and their main interaction, but it lacks the specific, chronological detail required. The phrase \"sharing multiple kissing movements\" is clinical and unnatural; a more direct description like \"they kiss several times\" would be clearer. The description \"remain largely still\" is too general and misses the opportunity to describe the subtle, connecting actions that likely occur, such as the man wrapping his arm around the woman's waist or the couple smiling at each other between kisses. Furthermore, the caption presents the hand placement as a static state rather than a distinct action within a sequence. A more accurate, chronological account might be: \"The woman on the left first places her right hand on the man's chest, after which they both lean forward and share several brief kisses.\" Lastly, \"perch\" is a metaphorical and imprecise term for their posture; specifying if they are sitting or kneeling in the nest would provide a more concrete visual.",
