    "pre_caption": "A woman in pajamas walks barefoot down a hallway. As she approaches the end of the hall, she raises her left arm toward a light switch on the wall. She then turns her head and torso to her right to look into a dark doorway, where a tall, slender, silhouetted figure stands motionless.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A woman with brown hair pulled back into a bun walks barefoot down a hallway. She is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved, button-down pajama shirt with a plaid pattern. As she raises her left arm to turn off the light, she turns to look into a dark doorway, where a tall, slender, silhouetted figure of a person is seen standing motionless in the darkness.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that closely follows the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description of the subjects and their actions.\n*   It correctly identifies two subjects: a woman and a silhouetted figure.\n*   The actions described (\"walks barefoot,\" \"raises her left arm,\" \"turns her head and torso,\" \"stands motionless\") are specific, clear, and plausible.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption provides a complete, end-to-end description of the motion in the scene.\n*   It successfully captures the primary subject's movement, her interaction with an object (the light switch), and her interaction with the secondary subject (looking at the figure).\n*   It also correctly notes the lack of motion in the secondary subject, as per the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Chronological Order:** The actions are perfectly sequenced: walking, raising an arm, and then turning to look.\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered on movement (\"walks,\" \"raises,\" \"turns\") rather than static appearance. The mention of \"pajamas\" and \"barefoot\" adds context without overshadowing the motion.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is brief yet provides all the essential details of the action.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective words (e.g., \"fearfully,\" \"creepy figure\"). It remains objective and descriptive.\n*   **No Speculation:** It states what is visible without using ambiguous or speculative phrases like \"it seems\" or \"perhaps.\"\n*   **Specificity:** The actions are described with excellent detail (e.g., \"turns her head and torso to her right\" instead of just \"looks right\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, objective, chronologically sound, and focuses precisely on the specific motions of the subjects involved. No improvements are needed.",
