    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video showcases a pixelated, stylized world featuring large, floating architectural structures against a dark green, star-dusted background with a geometric pattern. The main structure is a multi-tiered tower made of various shades of green pixels, with arched windows and grassy ledges. Two smaller, similar structures float nearby. On top of one platform, there is a large, glowing green rectangular portal flanked by small, stylized trees. Other elements include smaller floating structures, black bird-like creatures perched on the towers, and small yellow squares that float through the air. A snail with a blue and brown shell is located on top of the platforms.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main elements, but it could be improved by integrating the simultaneous actions more cohesively instead of listing them as separate events. The primary motion is the rotation of the entire scene, and the snail's movement and the floating pixels occur concurrently with this rotation. The description of the snail's location is vague; \"on top of the platform\" doesn't specify if this platform is part of the tower's base, its roof, or a separate floating island, which is a key spatial detail. Furthermore, the descriptions of motion are too generic. Instead of the snail \"slowly moving,\" the caption could specify that it is \"crawling forward in a straight line across a grassy patch.\" Similarly, \"yellow pixels are floating\" could be more precise, such as \"clusters of yellow pixels pulsate gently in place\" or \"individual yellow pixels drift upwards like embers from the tower's windows.\" Finally, the phrase \"shifting the perspective to reveal different faces\" is redundant, as this is the inherent result of the world rotating and doesn't need to be stated as a separate action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a pixelated world centered around a large floating tower, the entire scene rotates in a series of 90-degree turns, seamlessly revealing different faces of the 3D architectural structures. As the world turns, a small character with a red fez jumps between platforms, navigating the dynamic landscape. Concurrently, a snail crawls forward in a straight line across a grassy patch on a separate floating island. Clusters of yellow pixels pulsate gently in place, while individual yellow pixels drift upwards like embers from the tower's windows, adding a sense of magic to the ever-changing environment.",
