    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types, movement patterns, and interactions.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Three women stand close together under pink and blue lighting. The woman on the left has dark hair and wears a pink double-breasted blazer dress, a large earring, and black heeled sandals. The woman in the center, with long dark hair, smiles while wearing a black and white polka-dot top under a white blazer with white trousers and black heeled sandals. The woman on the right has long, light brown hair and wears a pink, short-sleeved, pleated dress with pink heeled sandals. The woman on the left has a black prosthetic left leg with intricate patterns on it.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects, the key camera movement, and the central reveal of the prosthetic leg in chronological order. However, the description of the motion is somewhat contradictory and contains speculative language. The phrase \"as if engaged in conversation and laughter\" is an interpretation of the women's mood rather than a description of their actions, which the instructions advise against. A better approach would be to simply state that they are smiling and looking at one another. Furthermore, describing the women as \"gently swaying\" while also stating they \"remain relatively still\" is confusing. Based on the camera's downward tilt, it's more likely their upper bodies are swaying while their feet are planted. The caption should specify this distinction, for instance, by stating that they sway their torsos or upper bodies from side to side. Clarifying that the movement is isolated to their upper bodies would resolve the contradiction and provide a more precise and accurate account of the motion in the video.",
