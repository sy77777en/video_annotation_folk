    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subject’s motion in this video, ensuring actions are presented in **chronological order** if multiple movements occur (e.g., \"The bird first takes flight, then soars in a circle, and finally lands on a branch\"). Focus on the subject's motion rather than repeating details already included in the human-written subject descriptions. Avoid describing anything not visible or uncertain. Use simple, natural English to create a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights essential details. Avoid emotional or subjective adjectives. Avoid speculative statements like 'there might be,' 'it appears,' or ambiguous options like 'A or B.' Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nIf the subject in the video has no movement, please briefly mention that without going into too much detail.\n\nPlease only describe the content of the video. Don't mention the details of the subject's appearance unless you need to differentiate between multiple subjects by their appearance. Clearly describe the subject's motion.\n\nAvoid abstract descriptions, such as \"The car maintains a low, sleek profile as it maneuvers the bend, emphasizing its speed and agility\" and \"emphasizing its speed and agility as it maneuvers through the turn.\"\n\nBelow are detailed instructions:\n\nDescribe **individual subject actions** with clarity, specifying how they move rather than using generic descriptions. For example, instead of “a person is running,” say “a runner sprints across the finish line.”\n\nIf the subject interacts with an **object**, specify the type of interaction and its effect. Instead of “a person is working,” say “a construction worker operates a jackhammer, breaking up the pavement.”\n\nIf there are **interactions between subjects**, describe the nature of their relationship and movements relative to each other. Instead of “people are fighting,” say “two boxers exchange blows in the ring, circling each other cautiously.”\n\nIf there are collective behaviors for a group of subjects, describe **group activities** with specificity. Instead of “birds are flying,” say “a flock of geese flies in a V-formation across the horizon.” Instead of “people are walking,” say “a crowd of protesters marches down the street, carrying signs and banners.” Clearly convey the type of group, their coordinated actions, and any notable patterns in their movement.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on their motion and dynamics.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video but does not comprehensively capture their motion. Use this caption as a reference or starting point to draft the description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subjects' motion and dynamics. However, if the caption does not mention any subjects, do not add any description—simply note this briefly in the description. Please note that this caption is only to help you clarify which subject's motion needs to be analyzed, rather than adding more content based on this description.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A single, translucent jellyfish with a turquoise glow is depicted against a dark background. The creature has a flattened, bell-shaped body with a delicate, thin rim. Visible within its center are more complex, folded structures that are also translucent and share the same turquoise hue.**",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a single jellyfish and precisely describes its characteristic method of locomotion: pulsating its bell by contracting and expanding to create propulsion. The resulting \"slow, drifting motion\" is also an accurate outcome of this action.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete and self-contained description of the subject's motion. It explains both the action (pulsating, contracting, expanding) and the result (propelling, drifting), giving a full picture of the movement shown in the video without needing additional context.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows all the given instructions:\n*   **Focus on Motion:** The description is centered entirely on the jellyfish's movement, using specific action verbs like \"pulsates,\" \"contracting,\" \"expanding,\" and \"propel.\"\n*   **Chronological/Logical Order:** It logically describes the cause (pulsation) and its effect (propulsion and drifting), which is the correct sequence for this continuous action.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet packed with descriptive detail about how the jellyfish moves.\n*   **No Speculation or Ambiguity:** It states definitively what is happening without using uncertain terms like \"appears to\" or \"might be.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives. While \"rhythmically\" and \"gentle\" are used, they function as objective descriptors of the motion's pattern and force rather than as subjective opinions.\n*   **No Abstract Descriptions:** The caption sticks to concrete, observable actions and avoids abstract interpretations like \"emphasizing its grace.\"\n*   **Specificity:** Instead of a generic phrase like \"the jellyfish swims,\" it details the mechanics of the movement (\"pulsates its bell-shaped body, contracting and expanding\").\n*   **Use of Appearance Details:** It mentions the \"bell-shaped body\" and \"translucent bell\" only to clarify what part of the subject is moving and how, which is a perfect application of the instruction.",
