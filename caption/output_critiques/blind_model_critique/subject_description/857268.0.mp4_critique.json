    "pre_caption": "The video features a man and a woman walking side by side along a narrow, sandy beach with clear, shallow water on either side. The man, on the right, is wearing a dark t-shirt and shorts, while the woman, on the left, is dressed in a black tank top and shorts. Both are barefoot, leaving footprints in the sand as they walk. Their shadows are cast on the sand, indicating the sun is overhead. In the distance, two more people are visible, walking further along the beach. The scene conveys a sense of leisure and tranquility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding subjectivity, speculation, and the level of detail required for subject attributes.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption accurately identifies the primary subjects (a man and a woman), their main action (walking), their location (a sandy beach/sandbar), and the presence of secondary subjects in the distance. The description of their clothing is also accurate at a basic level.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption is missing many of the key visual attributes requested in the instructions. For the man and woman, it fails to describe:\n    *   Skin tone\n    *   Hairstyle or color\n    *   Approximate age\n    *   Any other distinguishing features beyond basic clothing.\n    The instructions explicitly ask for these details to be included if discernible.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several core rules from the instructions:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives\":** The final sentence, \"The scene conveys a sense of leisure and tranquility,\" is a direct and significant violation of the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" This sentence describes the mood and feeling of the scene, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n2.  **Violation of \"Avoid Describing What Is Not Visible or What You Are Unsure About\":** The phrase \"...indicating the sun is overhead\" is an inference, not a direct observation. You can see the shadows, but stating the sun's exact position is a conclusion drawn from that evidence. A better, more objective description would be to simply describe the shadows themselves (e.g., \"Their short shadows are cast on the sand in front of them\").\n\n3.  **Failure to Provide Detailed Attributes:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption does not provide the required level of detail for the subjects. The instruction asks for \"clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity,\" but the caption only provides gender and basic clothing.\n\n4.  **Minor Stylistic Issue:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\" While not explicitly forbidden, it is a slightly meta-descriptive phrase. A more direct and immersive caption, as implied by the instructions, would start by describing the scene itself (e.g., \"A man and a woman walk side by side...\").\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions, assuming some visual details for the subjects:\n\nA man with a light skin tone and short brown hair walks barefoot on a narrow strip of sand. He is wearing a dark gray t-shirt and black shorts. To his left, a woman with a tan skin tone and long, dark hair tied back walks alongside him. She is wearing a black tank top and dark shorts and is also barefoot. Both are walking away from the viewer, leaving footprints in the wet sand, with shallow, clear water on either side of them. Far in the distance, two other figures are visible walking along the same strip of sand.",
