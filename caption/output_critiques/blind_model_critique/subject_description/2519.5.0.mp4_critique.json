    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a dimly lit setting. He has short, dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket over a sweater with a collared shirt underneath. The man appears to be interacting with a complex mechanical device, which has visible wires and components. He is positioned to the right, facing the device, and his posture suggests he is focused on it. The lighting casts a beam on him, highlighting his profile and the device. The scene conveys a sense of concentration and engagement with the machinery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but not perfect, as it violates a few key instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description. It correctly identifies a man as the primary subject and a mechanical device as the secondary subject. The described attributes—short dark hair, layered clothing (jacket, sweater, collared shirt), and the device's complexity (wires, components)—are plausible and specific. The description of the lighting and the man's posture also accurately reflects a scene focused on a detailed task.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete. It covers the main subject's appearance, clothing, and posture, as well as the key features of the object he is interacting with. It successfully creates a holistic picture of the scene by combining these elements. However, it could be more complete by replacing subjective interpretations with more objective visual details (e.g., instead of saying his posture \"suggests he is focused,\" it could say \"he leans forward with his gaze fixed on the device\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and brief overview of the scene's subjects.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses specific terms like \"man\" and \"mechanical device.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It describes the man's clothing, hair, and position effectively.\n*   **Single Paragraph:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly prioritizes the man and the device he is interacting with over the background.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n*   **Use of Meta-Language:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is explicitly against the spirit of the instructions to avoid meta-references like \"image\" or \"frame\" and to provide the description directly.\n*   **Use of Subjective/Interpretive Language:** The caption violates the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n    *   \"...his posture **suggests** he is focused on it.\" This is an interpretation of his mental state based on his posture, not a direct description of the posture itself.\n    *   \"The scene **conveys a sense of concentration and engagement** with the machinery.\" This is a clear violation, as \"concentration\" and \"engagement\" are subjective states and interpretations of the overall mood, which the instructions forbid.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately and clearly describes the visual content, it fails to adhere strictly to the constraints against using introductory meta-language and subjective interpretations. A better caption would state the objective facts only, allowing the reader to infer the sense of concentration on their own.",
