    "pre_caption": "The video features a dynamic display of vibrant yellow ink swirling and expanding in a fluid medium. The ink forms intricate, cloud-like patterns with soft, rounded edges, creating a sense of movement and transformation. The shapes continuously evolve, with the yellow hues varying in intensity, giving a rich, textured appearance. The overall effect is abstract, with the ink appearing to float and merge, creating a visually striking and fluid composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary subject as yellow ink in a fluid and captures its abstract quality, it overlooks several key visual details that would make the description more accurate and comprehensive. The video also features a second subject, a deep blue ink, which is introduced into the liquid and creates a dynamic contrast as it swirls and interacts with the yellow. The caption's failure to mention this second color omits the central visual tension of the composition. Furthermore, the description of the ink's form as having only \"soft, rounded edges\" is limiting; the ink also creates sharp, wispy tendrils and feathery filaments, especially where it moves quickly or disperses. The caption also uses subjective adjectives like \"intricate\" and \"visually striking,\" which should be replaced with more objective descriptions of the patterns' complexity and the high contrast between the saturated yellow and the dark blue. A more complete description would detail the interaction between the two inks, noting how they initially resist mixing, forming a distinct boundary before slowly blending at the edges.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a dynamic interplay of vibrant yellow and deep blue ink swirling and expanding in a fluid medium. The yellow and blue inks create a striking contrast as they interact, forming a central visual tension. The inks produce a variety of forms, including sharp, wispy tendrils and feathery filaments, especially where they move quickly or disperse. The shapes continuously evolve, with the yellow and blue hues varying in intensity, giving a rich, textured appearance.
