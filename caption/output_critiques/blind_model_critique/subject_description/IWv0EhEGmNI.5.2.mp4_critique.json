The character's hands are covered in light-colored gloves. The entire scene is rendered in a green-tinted night vision mode.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the vast majority of the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and well-structured. However, there are a few minor areas where it deviates slightly from the provided guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key subjects and their visual attributes:\n*   The first-person perspective.\n*   The modern assault rifle with a holographic sight.\n*   The light-colored gloves on the character's hands.\n*   The green-tinted night vision effect.\n*   The specific on-screen text for the objective (\"Find Hadir\"), waypoint (\"Search Church,\" 114m), compass, and the \"Checkpoint reached\" notification.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the salient visual information in the video without including unnecessary details about the background. It combines details from across the video's duration by mentioning the \"Checkpoint reached\" notification that \"appears briefly,\" fulfilling the instruction to describe the scene holistically.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of information in a single, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly focuses on the primary subjects (the weapon, hands) and the secondary subjects (the on-screen UI elements).\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"assault rifle,\" \"holographic sight,\" \"gloves,\" \"waypoint marker,\" and \"compass.\"\n*   **Logical Structure:** It follows a logical order, starting with the most central subject (the player's hands and weapon) and then describing the peripheral UI elements.\n*   **No Subjective Language:** It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Temporal Elements:** It correctly notes that the \"Checkpoint reached\" notification \"appears briefly,\" adhering to the instruction to describe subjects that appear or disappear.\n\n**Minor areas for improvement:**\n\n*   **Inference vs. Direct Observation:** The caption starts by stating, \"A first-person perspective from a video game shows a player character...\" While this is a correct inference, the instructions emphasize describing only what is visible. A stricter adherence would involve describing the visible elements first (e.g., \"A pair of hands in light-colored gloves holds a modern assault rifle...\") and letting the reader infer the \"video game\" context from the description of the heads-up display (HUD) elements that follow.\n*   **Describing the Unseen:** The caption mentions a \"player character,\" but only the hands are visible. The instruction is to \"avoid describing what is not visible.\" Describing \"a character's hands\" or \"a pair of hands\" would be more precise.\n*   **Word Choice:** The term \"rendered\" is slightly technical. The instruction calls for \"simple, natural English.\" A phrase like \"The scene is seen through a green-tinted night vision mode\" would be a more direct description of the visual experience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is of high quality and effectively communicates the content of the video. The minor deviations are based on making logical and almost certain inferences about the context, which in many cases can make a description more helpful. However, based on a strict interpretation of the provided rules, it could be made slightly more compliant by focusing purely on direct visual observation in its opening sentence.",
