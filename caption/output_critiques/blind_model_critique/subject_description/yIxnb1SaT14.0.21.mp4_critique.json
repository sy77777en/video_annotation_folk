    "pre_caption": "This video captures a vibrant cityscape time-lapse of a Parisian street corner at night, likely near Place Vend么me, identifiable by the prominent column in the background. The scene is imbued with a festive atmosphere, featuring a glowing Christmas tree on a corner and grand, historic buildings with warmly lit windows, one of which is adorned with a massive, golden sunburst sculpture. There is no single main subject, as the time-lapse technique intentionally blurs individual elements like cars and people to emphasize the overall environment and its dynamic energy. This is achieved through the long exposure, which transforms the movement of traffic into brilliant red and white light trails that streak across the reflective pavement, creating a visual spectacle that makes the city's lively pulse the true focus of the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot without a primary subject, it relies too heavily on subjective language and technical explanations, contrary to the instructions. Words like \"vibrant,\" \"festive,\" and \"brilliant\" should be replaced with objective descriptions; for instance, instead of a \"festive atmosphere,\" you could describe the \"conical Christmas tree decorated with steady, yellow lights\" and the \"yellow glow from the windows of the multi-story stone buildings.\" The caption also speculates on the location (\"likely near Place Vend么me\") and explains the time-lapse technique (\"long exposure, which transforms the movement...\"), which should be avoided. A better approach is to describe only what is visible: \"A tall, green-patinated column stands in the background,\" and \"streaks of red and white light from vehicle traffic cross the wet, reflective pavement.\" Furthermore, the static elements could be described in greater detail. For example, the \"golden sunburst sculpture\" could be detailed as \"a large, metallic, gold-colored sunburst with numerous radiating rays, mounted on the facade of a corner building above the ground floor.\" The description should focus purely on the visual content of the scene rather than the photographic method used to create it or the emotional response it evokes.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a cityscape time-lapse of a Parisian street corner at night. A tall, green-patinated column stands in the background, suggesting a location near Place Vend么me. The scene includes a conical Christmas tree decorated with steady, yellow lights on a corner, and multi-story stone buildings with a yellow glow emanating from their windows. A large, metallic, gold-colored sunburst with numerous radiating rays is mounted on the facade of a corner building above the ground floor. Streaks of red and white light from vehicle traffic cross the wet, reflective pavement, highlighting the dynamic energy of the environment.",
