    "pre_caption": "This video is a first-person perspective shot from within a diving suit or submersible, framed by the red edges of a mask or viewport. The only visible part of the person is their hands, which are covered in red gloves. The hands appear from the bottom of the frame, and one reaches out to interact with a small, glowing blue crystalline object floating in the dark water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is a first-person perspective shot through a diver’s mask. The frame shows the mask’s edges, the person’s hands, and the underwater scenery, making it difficult to determine the shot size.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is detailed feedback on the caption.\n\nThe caption is good in its intent and captures the general essence of the video, but it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the visible elements—the red edges, the red gloves on the hands, and the small, glowing blue crystalline object—is accurate. The action of reaching out is also correctly identified.\n*   **Inaccurate Speculation:** The caption speculates by stating the video is from \"within a diving suit or submersible\" and that the object is floating in \"dark water.\" While these are logical inferences, the instructions explicitly state, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" The caption should only describe the visible dark environment, not label it as \"water,\" and should describe the visible elements (mask/viewport, gloves) without concluding they belong to a \"diving suit or submersible.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Sufficiently Complete:** The caption successfully identifies and describes all the salient subjects and the primary action. It provides enough detail for a reader to visualize the core content of the video.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n*   **Violation - Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"This video is...\", which is introductory text. The instructions state, \"**Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.**\"\n*   **Violation - Forbidden Terminology:** The caption uses the word \"frame\" (\"from the bottom of the frame\"). The instructions state, \"**avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.**\"\n*   **Violation - Speculation:** As mentioned under \"Accuracy,\" the caption speculates about the setting (\"diving suit,\" \"submersible,\" \"water\"), directly violating the rule to only describe what is visible.\n*   **Partial Adherence - Subject Focus:** The caption correctly focuses on the subjects. However, it starts by defining the shot type (\"a first-person perspective shot\") rather than immediately describing the subjects. A better approach would be to weave the perspective into the description of the subjects themselves.\n*   **Good Adherence - Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is concise, written in a single paragraph, and uses simple, natural English.\n*   **Good Adherence - No Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses descriptive adjectives (\"small,\" \"glowing,\" \"blue,\" \"crystalline\") rather than subjective ones that convey emotion.\n\n### Summary\n\n**The caption is not good because it violates three explicit negative constraints in the instructions:** it includes introductory text, uses the forbidden word \"frame,\" and engages in speculation about the environment. While it accurately describes the visible objects and actions, these violations make it a poor fit for the provided guidelines. A better caption would describe the scene purely based on visual evidence, such as: \"The view is framed by the red edges of a viewport or mask. A pair of hands in red gloves moves into view from below, with one hand reaching toward a small, glowing blue crystalline object that floats in a dark space.\"",
