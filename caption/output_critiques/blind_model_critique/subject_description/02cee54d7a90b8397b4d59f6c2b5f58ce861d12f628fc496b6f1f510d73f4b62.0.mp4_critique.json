    "pre_caption": "The video features two women on a spiral staircase. The woman at the top has light skin and is wearing a white shirt and dark pants. She is leaning over the railing, looking downward. The woman on the stairs has medium skin and curly hair, wearing a white blouse and dark pants. She is seated on the steps, facing forward. The staircase is wooden and centrally located, with both women positioned prominently on it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

It is accurate, complete, and follows the specified format and style guidelines.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It uses objective and verifiable language (e.g., \"white shirt,\" \"dark pants,\" \"curly hair,\" \"wooden staircase\"). It avoids making assumptions or describing things that are not explicitly visible, such as emotions or intentions.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive without being overly long.\n    *   It successfully identifies the main subjects (\"two women\") and the key object they are interacting with (\"spiral staircase\").\n    *   It provides sufficient visual attributes for each woman, including skin tone, hair, clothing (color and type), and pose/orientation (\"leaning over the railing, looking downward,\" \"seated on the steps, facing forward\").\n    *   It also describes the key attributes of the staircase (\"wooden,\" \"spiral,\" \"centrally located\"), which is essential for understanding the scene's composition.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption meticulously follows the rules outlined in the instructions.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It gets straight to the point without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the subjects and their attributes, avoiding descriptions of the background.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or subjective adjectives.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the two women by their location (\"the woman at the top,\" \"the woman on the stairs\"), which is a clear and logical method as suggested by the instructions.\n    *   **Structure and Priority:** The caption introduces the general scene first, then describes each subject in a logical spatial order (top to bottom), which makes the description easy to follow.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a model caption that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt. It is a clear, objective, and well-structured description that gives the reader a precise understanding of the video's visual content.",
