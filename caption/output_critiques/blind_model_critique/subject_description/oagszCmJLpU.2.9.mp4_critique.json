    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful storm system moving across a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by a massive, dark grey storm cloud that looms over the entire scene, with a concentrated downpour visible as a rain shaft in the distance, illuminated by a contrasting pocket of golden light. Below, a vibrant green field of wind-swept grass stretches to the horizon, where a few tiny buildings are dwarfed by the immense scale of the weather formation. There is no main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the environment itself, emphasizing the atmospheric tension and the sheer scale of the natural spectacle rather than any single object or figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the overall mood and scale of the landscape, it misses several key dynamic and specific visual elements that would likely be present in such a video. The description of a \"powerful storm system\" is somewhat generic; if the video shows a rotating supercell, the caption should describe the distinct, churning, and swirling structure of the cloud base to convey its power more accurately. Furthermore, a storm of this magnitude would almost certainly feature lightning, yet the caption makes no mention of the brilliant, jagged flashes of cloud-to-ground strikes or the pulsating, internal illumination within the dark cloud mass, which would be a primary visual feature. The \"pocket of golden light\" could be described with more precision; for instance, specifying that it is late-afternoon sunlight breaking through the western edge of the storm front, casting long shadows and highlighting the texture of the wind-whipped grass. Finally, while the grass is noted as \"wind-swept,\" the caption understates the motion. A more vivid description would detail the rapid, wave-like movement of the grass and the visible, time-lapsed advance of the rain shaft as it sweeps across the plain, better reflecting the video's dynamic nature.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases a breathtaking and dynamic landscape, capturing a rotating supercell storm system moving across a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by a massive, churning, and swirling dark grey cloud base, with brilliant, jagged lightning strikes illuminating the scene and pulsating flashes lighting up the cloud's interior. A concentrated rain shaft is visible in the distance, advancing rapidly across the plain. Late-afternoon sunlight breaks through the western edge of the storm front, casting long shadows and highlighting the texture of the vibrant green field of wind-whipped grass, which moves in rapid, wave-like patterns. Tiny buildings on the horizon are dwarfed by the immense scale of the weather formation, emphasizing the atmospheric tension and the sheer magnitude of this natural spectacle.",
