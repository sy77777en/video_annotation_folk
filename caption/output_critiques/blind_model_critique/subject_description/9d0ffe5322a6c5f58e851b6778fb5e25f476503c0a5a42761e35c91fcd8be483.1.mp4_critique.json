    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing the urban skyline against a dramatic sunset. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the environment. The composition emphasizes the interplay between the natural beauty of the sky and the man-made structures below, creating a mood of tranquil beauty. The sky is filled with a vast expanse of clouds, painted in warm hues of gold, orange, and soft yellow by the setting sun, contrasting with darker, purplish-grey tones higher up. Below, a silhouette of city buildings and lush, dark green trees stretches across the horizon, with some structures catching the last glimmers of sunlight, creating a serene and picturesque urban vista.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot and explains the absence of a main subject, it relies heavily on subjective and interpretive language, which the instructions advise against. Terms like \"dramatic sunset,\" \"grand scale,\" \"tranquil beauty,\" and \"serene and picturesque\" describe an emotional response rather than the visual facts of the scene. The description of \"lush, dark green trees\" is also likely inaccurate; in a sunset silhouette, the foliage would probably appear as a dark, almost black mass without discernible color or texture. Furthermore, the caption includes introductory framing like \"This video presents\" and analytical comments such as \"The composition emphasizes,\" which should be omitted in favor of a direct description. To improve, the caption should focus on more concrete, observable details. For instance, if the video showed it, it could specify the types of buildings (e.g., \"glass-faced skyscrapers and low-rise brick structures\"), mention any distinct landmarks like a lit-up bridge or a radio tower, and describe the light more factually, such as noting that \"windows on the west-facing sides of some buildings reflect the orange light\" instead of just saying they catch \"glimmers of sunlight.\" A more effective description would strip away the poetic interpretation and present a purely factual account of the skyline, the specific colors in the sky, and the forms of the silhouetted objects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a cityscape at sunset, featuring a skyline with a mix of glass-faced skyscrapers and low-rise brick buildings. The sky is filled with clouds in shades of gold, orange, and soft yellow near the horizon, transitioning to darker purplish-grey tones higher up. The silhouette of the city includes indistinct dark masses of trees and various buildings, with some windows on the west-facing sides reflecting the orange light of the setting sun. The scene captures the urban environment against the backdrop of a colorful sky.",
