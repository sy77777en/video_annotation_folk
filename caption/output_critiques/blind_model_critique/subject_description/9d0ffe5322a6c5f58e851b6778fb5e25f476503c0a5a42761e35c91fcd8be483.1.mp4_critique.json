    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing the urban skyline against a dramatic sunset. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the environment. The composition emphasizes the interplay between the natural beauty of the sky and the man-made structures below, creating a mood of tranquil beauty. The sky is filled with a vast expanse of clouds, painted in warm hues of gold, orange, and soft yellow by the setting sun, contrasting with darker, purplish-grey tones higher up. Below, a silhouette of city buildings and lush, dark green trees stretches across the horizon, with some structures catching the last glimmers of sunlight, creating a serene and picturesque urban vista.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is not good:\n\n**Accuracy & Completeness:**\n*   The caption is likely accurate in its visual description of a cityscape at sunset, detailing the colors of the sky and the silhouette of the buildings and trees.\n*   It is complete in that it correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and describes the key visual elements present.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails on the following crucial points:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The most significant failure is the repeated use of subjective and emotional language. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption violates this rule with words and phrases like:\n    *   \"**dramatic** sunset\"\n    *   \"natural **beauty**\"\n    *   \"**tranquil beauty**\"\n    *   \"**serene** and **picturesque** urban vista\"\n    These terms describe the mood and the viewer's potential emotional response, which is strictly forbidden.\n\n2.  **Use of Interpretive Language:** The caption analyzes the scene's composition rather than just describing it. The instruction is to describe what is visually present. The phrase \"**The composition emphasizes** the interplay...\" is an artistic interpretation, not a direct visual description.\n\n3.  **Inclusion of Introductory and Explanatory Text:** The instruction for scenery shots is to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot... in a single fluent paragraph.\" While it asks for an explanation of why there is no main subject, the caption does this in a very literal and non-fluent way. Phrases like \"**This video presents...**\" and \"**There is no single main subject, as the focus is on...**\" are meta-commentary about the video and the captioning process itself, rather than a natural, integrated description of the scene. A better approach would be to weave this information into the description more seamlessly.\n\nIn summary, while the caption successfully describes the visual content in a single paragraph, its heavy reliance on subjective, emotional, and interpretive language is a direct and repeated violation of the core instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A wide cityscape is captured at sunset, showcasing the urban skyline against a sky filled with clouds in shades of gold, orange, and soft yellow, with darker purplish-grey tones above. The silhouette of city buildings and dark green trees stretches across the horizon, with some structures reflecting the last light of the day. The focus is on the overall scene, highlighting the contrast between the sky and the city below.",
