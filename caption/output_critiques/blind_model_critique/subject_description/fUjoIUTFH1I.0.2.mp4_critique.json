The focus is not on a specific subject but rather on the overwhelming environment, creating a sense of mystery and immense scale. A large, metallic, truss-like framework with a peaked roofline looms in the center, its full form obscured by thick, swirling grey fog or steam that dominates the entire view, making the structure appear ethereal and ghost-like.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main elements as an industrial bridge and heavy fog from an aerial perspective, it deviates from the core instructions in several key areas. The description relies heavily on subjective and emotional language such as \"atmospheric,\" \"overwhelming,\" \"mystery,\" \"ethereal,\" and \"ghost-like,\" which the guidelines explicitly prohibit in favor of objective visual facts. The caption is also contradictory; it claims there is no specific subject but then describes the bridge in detail, which is clearly the central subject of this scenery shot. Furthermore, the description lacks specific visual details that would likely be present in the video. For instance, it omits the color and condition of the bridge's \"metallic\" frameworkâ€”is it painted dark grey, showing patches of orange rust, or is it weathered steel? It also fails to describe the water's surface, which might be visible as dark, choppy waves below. Adding concrete details, such as red aviation warning lights blinking intermittently through the mist or specifying the structure as a cantilever bridge, would create a more precise and visually grounded description, adhering more closely to the prompt's requirements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures an aerial view of a massive industrial cantilever bridge shrouded in thick grey fog. The bridge's metallic framework, painted dark grey with patches of orange rust, stands prominently in the center. Red aviation warning lights blink intermittently through the mist, adding to the scene's dynamic nature. Below, the water's surface is visible, showing dark, choppy waves. The focus is on the bridge itself, highlighting its immense scale and structural details amidst the foggy environment.",
