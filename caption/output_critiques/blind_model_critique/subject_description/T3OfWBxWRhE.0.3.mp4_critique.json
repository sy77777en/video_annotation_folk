In the foreground, a man with short dark hair wears a green t-shirt, standing next to another man in a blue and green plaid shirt. To their right, a woman with long dark brown hair and fair skin is visible, smiling slightly. Other people in the crowd include a woman on the left with long dark hair and a patterned top, and another person wearing a red hat. The crowd is looking towards a massive Baroque fountain integrated into the facade of a large, classical-style building made of light-colored stone. The fountain's central feature is a large statue of a muscular man with a beard standing on a shell, flanked by other statues of figures and horses set among sculpted rocks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects and provides excellent detail on the fountain's statuary and the building's architecture, it could be improved by restructuring its focus and adding more dynamic visual information. The description prioritizes the crowd, but in a video of a landmark like this, the massive fountain is almost certainly the primary subject and should be described first. The characterization of the crowd is also too static; stating they are all \"looking towards\" the fountain is a generalization that misses the likely variety of actions present in a real-world scene. For instance, the video probably shows people taking photos, sitting on the fountain's edge, or tossing coins into the water, details which would add life and accuracy. Furthermore, the caption completely omits a crucial element of any fountain: the water. Describing how water cascades over the sculpted rocks and collects in the large basin would significantly enhance the visual description. Finally, the phrasing is slightly redundant, mentioning a \"large, ornate fountain\" and then a \"massive Baroque fountain\" separately; these descriptions could be combined for a more concise and impactful opening.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a stunning view of a massive Baroque fountain integrated into the facade of a large, classical-style building made of light-colored stone. Water cascades over sculpted rocks, collecting in a large basin below, while the central statue of a muscular, bearded man standing on a shell is flanked by figures and horses. In front of this impressive landmark, a diverse crowd of people engages in various activities: some take photos, others sit on the fountain's edge, and a few toss coins into the water. Among them, a man with short dark hair in a green t-shirt stands next to another man in a blue and green plaid shirt. To their right, a woman with long dark brown hair and fair skin smiles slightly. On the left, a woman with long dark hair wears a patterned top, and another person sports a red hat. The scene captures the lively interaction between the visitors and the iconic fountain.",
