    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with medium skin tone and dark hair pulled back, wearing a black top. Her expression is serious and focused.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, concise, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed instructions. It successfully creates a clear mental image of the subject in the video.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption provides specific, verifiable details about the subject (\"medium skin tone,\" \"dark hair pulled back,\" \"black top,\" \"centrally positioned\"). These are objective attributes that can be confirmed by viewing the video.\n*   **Completeness:** It offers a well-rounded description by including the subject's appearance, clothing, pose, and expression. For a concise description, it captures all the essential information without being overly verbose.\n\n**2. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and packed with useful information. It gets straight to the point.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the primary subject (the woman) and describes her key visual attributes in detail, as instructed.\n*   **Avoidance of Forbidden Terms:** The caption correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"background.\" It uses \"video\" once at the beginning, which is appropriate for context.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption excels at being objective. It describes her expression as \"serious and focused\" with a \"clear and direct gaze,\" which are observable descriptions of her facial muscles and eye contact, rather than subjective emotional interpretations like \"she is determined\" or \"she is unhappy.\"\n*   **Precise Language:** It uses the precise term \"woman\" and provides specific details (\"dark hair pulled back,\" \"black top\") instead of vague descriptions.\n*   **Structure and Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n*   **Handling of Nuance:** The final sentence, \"The lighting highlights her facial features, emphasizing her eyes and lips,\" is a good observation. While it describes a cinematographic choice, it's used effectively to enhance the description of the subject's own features, which is a sophisticated way to follow the spirit of the instructions. It describes a visible effect on the subject without getting lost in technical details about the lighting setup itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example that demonstrates a strong understanding of all the rules. It is well-written, descriptive, and follows the complex set of constraints perfectly. There are no significant areas for improvement.",
