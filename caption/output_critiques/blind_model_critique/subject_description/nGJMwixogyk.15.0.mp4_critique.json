    "pre_caption": "The video shows a group of people walking along a narrow street lined with shops. Among them, two women are walking side by side in the center; one wears a white dress and a wide-brimmed hat, while the other wears a black top with a white pattern and dark pants. A man with a backpack, light brown pants, and a light-colored shirt stands further ahead, facing away from the camera. Another woman, dressed in white and holding a bag, stands near a shop entrance on the left. Additional people, including a person pushing a stroller and a man in a short-sleeved patterned shirt, are visible further along the street. The group consists of adults and at least one child, with a variety of casual summer clothing and accessories.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a detailed, sequential log of pedestrians, but it lacks cohesion and reads more like a list of events than a unified description of the scene. By focusing so heavily on the entrance and exit of each individual or group, the description feels fragmented and fails to capture the overall atmosphere of a continuous, forward-moving shot through a bustling street. For instance, the constant repetition of \"exits the frame\" is clunky and violates the spirit of describing the scene holistically. A more effective approach would be to first establish the scene—a forward-moving perspective through a crowded pedestrian thoroughfare—and then describe the crowd collectively, highlighting the most visually distinct individuals as examples of the passersby. The mention of kimonos and numerous people with umbrellas strongly suggests a specific cultural context, perhaps a tourist district or festival in Japan, which is a crucial detail omitted from the caption that would give meaning to the subjects' attire. The description could be improved by grouping the subjects more fluidly, such as \"a diverse crowd of pedestrians fills the street, including a family pushing a stroller, a couple in casual wear, and two women in traditional kimonos,\" which is more concise and paints a clearer overall picture than the current play-by-play.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a lively scene on a bustling, narrow street lined with shops, likely in a vibrant tourist district or during a festival in Japan. A diverse crowd of pedestrians fills the street, moving forward in a continuous flow. Among them, two women stand out in traditional kimonos, adding a cultural touch to the scene. Nearby, a family pushes a stroller, while a couple in casual summer attire strolls leisurely. The atmosphere is lively and colorful, with people of all ages enjoying the day, some carrying umbrellas to shield from the sun. The scene conveys a sense of movement and cultural richness, offering a glimpse into the vibrant street life.",
