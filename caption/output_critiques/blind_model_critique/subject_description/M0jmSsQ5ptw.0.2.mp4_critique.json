    "pre_caption": "A person wearing a black and white jumpsuit and a white helmet lands on a large, circular grey platform with a red bullseye, their large white parachute featuring a red and yellow \"Red Bull\" logo billowing behind them. As the parachute deflates, the view pans to the right, revealing that the parachute's lines are attached to a complex wooden and metal contraption. Standing on a wooden ramp that is part of this structure is a man in a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, holding a large wooden board, with a skateboard at his feet.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"person\" (appropriately neutral given the helmet and gear), their clothing (\"black and white jumpsuit,\" \"white helmet\"), and the key objects associated with them (\"large white parachute\" with a \"Red Bull\" logo). It accurately describes the landing target as a \"large, circular grey platform with a red bullseye.\" The description of the second subject as a \"man in a yellow t-shirt and dark pants\" and the objects with him (\"large wooden board,\" \"skateboard\") is also precise. The description of the action—landing, parachute deflating, and the camera pan—is a correct representation of the video's events.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential elements of the video in a concise manner. It successfully describes:\n*   **Both key subjects:** The parachutist and the man on the ramp.\n*   **Key objects:** The parachute, the landing platform, the contraption, the wooden board, and the skateboard.\n*   **The relationship between elements:** It correctly notes that the parachute lines are attached to the \"complex wooden and metal contraption\" where the second man is standing.\n*   **The sequence of events:** It follows the video's narrative flow, starting with the landing and then describing the pan that reveals the second part of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption follows every rule outlined in the instructions flawlessly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that conveys a large amount of information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered on the subjects and their visual attributes. Background is only mentioned as part of the subjects' immediate environment (platform, ramp).\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The language is objective and descriptive (e.g., \"complex wooden and metal contraption\" instead of \"strange machine\").\n*   **Precise and Detailed:** It uses specific terms (\"jumpsuit,\" \"bullseye,\" \"skateboard\") and provides detailed attributes (colors, logos, materials).\n*   **Handles Multiple Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the \"person\" landing and the \"man\" on the ramp by describing their unique appearance and location.\n*   **Describes Transitions:** It perfectly describes the camera movement and the resulting reveal, stating \"the view pans to the right, revealing that...\" which is an exemplary way to handle in-shot transitions.\n*   **Logical Order:** The description follows the temporal order of the video, which is the most logical structure for this scene.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and meticulously crafted to meet all the specified requirements.",
