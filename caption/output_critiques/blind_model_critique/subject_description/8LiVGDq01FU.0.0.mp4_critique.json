    "pre_caption": "The video features a man wearing a white space suit with a helmet that has a clear visor. His face is visible through the visor, showing a light skin tone and short hair. The man appears to be speaking or reacting with an expressive face, as his mouth is open and his eyes are wide. The suit has visible details such as straps and connectors, typical of astronaut gear. The man is oriented towards the camera, and his facial expression suggests he is engaged in an intense or urgent situation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to almost all of the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and well-written. However, there is one minor area where it could be improved to align perfectly with the rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate. It provides a factual and objective description of the subject's appearance, including the \"white space suit,\" \"clear visor,\" \"light skin tone,\" \"short hair,\" and the specific details of his facial expression (\"mouth is open and his eyes are wide\").\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It successfully identifies the subject type (\"man\"), describes his clothing in detail (\"space suit,\" \"helmet,\" \"straps and connectors\"), notes his physical attributes (\"light skin tone,\" \"short hair\"), and describes his expression and orientation (\"expressive face,\" \"oriented towards the camera\"). It paints a clear and thorough picture of the subject.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the single, salient subject (the man) without mentioning the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Objective Attributes:** It excels at describing visual attributes with specific language (e.g., \"white space suit,\" \"clear visor,\" \"straps and connectors\").\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It clearly identifies the subject as \"a man.\"\n*   **Describes Pose/Orientation:** It notes that the man is \"oriented towards the camera.\"\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n*   **Avoids Speculation/Interpretation:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The final sentence, \"...his facial expression suggests he is engaged in an intense or urgent situation,\" is an interpretation of the context or narrative. While it's a logical inference based on his wide eyes and open mouth, it describes a *situation* that is not directly visible. A stricter adherence to the rules would be to describe only the physical expression and let the reader infer the situation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is very good and follows the instructions closely. Its only minor flaw is the final interpretive clause. By removing the speculation about the \"intense or urgent situation,\" the caption would be a perfect example of adhering to all the given constraints.",
