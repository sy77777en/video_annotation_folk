    "pre_caption": "Inside a car, three men are visible, each wearing a distinct clown mask. The man in the front passenger seat is in profile, facing right. His white mask features a large, bulbous red nose, blue makeup around the eyes—one with a star shape, the other a teardrop—and red lips painted in a wide, slightly downturned smile. A tuft of dark hair is visible at the top of his mask, and he wears a dark collared garment. The man in the driver's seat, also wearing a white clown mask with a large red nose, blue eye makeup, and a wide red smile, has a tuft of spiky, light-colored hair atop his mask. He is dressed in a dark suit jacket over a lighter-colored collared shirt and is looking forward, hands on the steering wheel. In the back seat, another man is partially visible, wearing a clown mask with less distinct features due to distance and focus, and a light-colored hooded garment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the three men in clown masks within the car, but it misses the dynamic interplay and some key visual details that define the video's tense atmosphere. For instance, while the driver is described as turning his head, the caption fails to mention that the man in the passenger seat is not static; he nervously adjusts a pair of black leather gloves he is wearing and occasionally glances back at the man in the rear. The description of the masks could be more specific: the passenger's mask has a single, painted-on blue teardrop under its right eye, and the driver's \"light-colored\" hair is a vibrant, messy shock of orange. Furthermore, the third man's mask in the back, though partially obscured, is clearly different—it's a sad clown mask with a downturned mouth and a prominent, round red nose that catches the light as he leans forward between the front seats. The caption also overlooks the crucial effect of the environment; the video is characterized by the rhythmic sweep of passing streetlights across the interior, which intermittently illuminates the grotesque, fixed smiles on the masks, creating a more unsettling visual than a static description implies. Finally, all three men are wearing identical, slightly rumpled dark blue suits, a detail that suggests they are a unified group and is more specific than \"dark collared garment\" or \"similar suit.\"",
