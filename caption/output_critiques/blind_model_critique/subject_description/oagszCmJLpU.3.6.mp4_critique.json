    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a vast, ominous sky filled with turbulent storm clouds. The clouds are a deep, moody teal and gray, with their upper edges catching a soft pink and white light, creating a stark contrast against the darkness. Below the heavy cloud cover, a curtain of rain falls in the distance, illuminated by a diffuse, greenish-white light that breaks through the gloom. The land is an expansive, flat prairie covered in yellowish-green grass, stretching out to a distant, unbroken horizon. There is no main subject in the composition; the focus is instead on the immense scale of the environment and the powerful, atmospheric mood created by the impending storm over the open plains.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the overall atmosphere and scale of the storm, but it could be enhanced by incorporating more specific dynamic and subtle details from the video. For instance, the description of the clouds as 'turbulent' could be substantiated by mentioning their slow, rolling movement across the sky from left to right. The 'curtain of rain' is not static; it visibly shifts and sways with the wind, and a brief, silent flicker of sheet lightning momentarily illuminates the cloud mass from within, a key visual event the caption omits. Furthermore, while the prairie is described as flat, a faint, unpaved road is visible, snaking from the lower right corner toward the distant storm, which adds a crucial sense of scale and a subtle narrative of a path leading into the weather. Finally, while the caption correctly identifies the environment as the focus, it could more accurately frame the illuminated rain shaft as the primary, albeit transient, focal point of the composition, rather than stating there is no main subject at all.",
