    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the majestic facade of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris at night. The grand Gothic structure, with its two iconic towers and large rose window, is brilliantly illuminated against a dark, moody sky. In the foreground, a large Christmas tree, densely wrapped in glowing blue and white lights, adds a vibrant, festive element to the scene. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, using the interplay of architectural grandeur and festive lighting to create a powerful sense of place and occasion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects as the Notre-Dame Cathedral and a Christmas tree, and accurately describes the camera movement, it relies too heavily on subjective and interpretive language, such as \"majestic,\" \"grand,\" \"brilliantly,\" and \"moody,\" which violates the instruction to avoid emotional or opinion-based adjectives. Instead of stating the cathedral is \"brilliantly illuminated,\" it would be more descriptive to specify the color and effect of the light, such as \"The cathedral's light-colored stone facade is lit from below by warm, golden light, casting deep shadows across its Gothic details.\" Furthermore, the caption includes analytical phrases like \"enhancing the dynamic composition\" and \"create a powerful sense of place,\" which interpret the scene's effect rather than describing its visual content. The description of the Christmas tree is good but could be more specific; for instance, if the lights were twinkling or arranged in a particular pattern, that detail would be valuable. Finally, the concluding sentence explaining the focus on atmosphere is overly analytical; the visual description of the two illuminated subjects and the camera's movement already conveys this, and a more concise statement would be more effective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a nighttime view of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, showcasing its light-colored stone facade illuminated from below by warm, golden light that highlights its Gothic architecture. The two iconic towers and large rose window stand out against the dark sky. In the foreground, a large Christmas tree is adorned with glowing blue and white lights, adding a festive touch. The lights on the tree twinkle, enhancing the visual appeal of the scene. The video emphasizes the illuminated cathedral and tree, creating a striking visual contrast against the night backdrop.",
