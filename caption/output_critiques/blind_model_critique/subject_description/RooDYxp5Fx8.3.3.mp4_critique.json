    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment characterized by modern buildings with clean lines and varied facades, a well-maintained sidewalk with tactile paving, and a busy street featuring vehicles such as a black van and a large white truck. The scene is bright and clear, with a blue sky and scattered clouds overhead, and signage in Japanese providing a sense of place. There is no main subject in the video; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the city, emphasizing the interplay between architecture, infrastructure, and daily urban life rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot.\" It correctly describes the key visual elements present: modern buildings, a sidewalk with tactile paving, a street with a black van and a white truck, a blue sky with clouds, and Japanese signage. All these details are verifiable in the video.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive for a scenery shot. It captures the essential components of the urban environment—architecture, infrastructure, and atmospheric details—to give a full picture of the scene without needing to focus on a single subject.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption perfectly follows the specific rule for scenery shots. It identifies the type (\"cityscape scenery shot\") and provides a clear, concise explanation for the lack of a main subject in the final sentence, as instructed.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is well-structured, concise, and uses simple, natural English. It effectively communicates the scene's characteristics.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives. Terms like \"modern buildings with clean lines\" and \"well-maintained sidewalk\" are descriptive of the visual state rather than conveying emotion.\n    *   **Formatting and Forbidden Terms:** It is a single paragraph with no markdown or introductory text and correctly avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Detail and Specificity:** It provides specific, useful details (e.g., \"black van,\" \"large white truck,\" \"tactile paving,\" \"signage in Japanese\") that enrich the description without being excessive.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions to a scenery video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all formatting and content guidelines.",
