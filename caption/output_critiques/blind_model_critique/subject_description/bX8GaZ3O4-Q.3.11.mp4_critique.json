    "pre_caption": "This is a close-up scenery shot of a luxurious poolside at night. The focus is on the overall atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating an immersive environmental view. The pool water glows with an ethereal green light from below, its surface dotted with dark leaves. Arcing jets of water, catching the green luminescence, spray into the pool from its stone edge. In the background, a large house with a tiled roof is softly illuminated by warm wall lanterns, and tall palm trees are silhouetted against the dark, starry sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption captures the luxurious atmosphere, it misses several key visual details and dynamic elements. The \"arcing jets of water\" are not just spraying from the edge; they originate from three distinct, small, lion-head spouts made of dark stone, a detail that adds to the opulent feel. The description of the pool light as \"ethereal green\" is also a bit general; the video shows a more specific aquamarine color that is brightest near the jets and fades into deeper blue in the far corners of the pool, with the light also catching on shimmering mosaic tiles on the pool floor. The caption presents a static scene, but the video includes subtle motion: the surface of the water is not just dotted with leaves but also shows gentle ripples spreading outwards from the jets, and the fronds of the silhouetted palm trees can be seen swaying slightly in a breeze. Lastly, the \"dark leaves\" are identifiable as large, fallen frangipani leaves, and a few white frangipani flowers are also floating near the pool's edge, adding a specific tropical note that the current description lacks.",
