    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm over a vast canyon at night. Under a partially starry sky, massive, dark storm clouds gather, periodically erupting in brilliant flashes of lightning that illuminate the deep, layered rock formations of the canyon below. A distinct column of rain is visible within the storm, and a single, sharp bolt of lightning strikes down, while a mysterious, steady orange glow persists on the distant horizon. The video lacks a main subject, as its purpose is to convey the immense scale and awe-inspiring power of the natural environment and the atmospheric drama of the storm itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the general atmosphere of the storm, it could be more precise about the visual specifics. The description of \"a single, sharp bolt of lightning\" feels understated, as the video actually shows multiple distinct, forked bolts striking the canyon floor, in addition to the more frequent, diffuse sheet lightning that illuminates the clouds from within. The \"partially starry sky\" is only visible for a brief moment at the start before being completely obscured by the advancing storm front, a progression the caption omits. The \"mysterious, steady orange glow\" is not entirely mysterious; its position and consistency suggest it is the light pollution from a distant town, a detail that would provide a more objective description. Furthermore, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the colors revealed by the lightning flashes; the brief, intense light reveals the canyon walls to be a deep, stratified red and ochre. Finally, while mentioning the \"distinct column of rain\" is good, the caption could have noted how the lightning backlights this rain shaft, making it appear as a shimmering, almost solid curtain of water against the dark sky.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dramatic thunderstorm over a vast canyon at night, showcasing the immense scale and power of nature. As the storm advances, the initially visible starry sky is quickly obscured by massive, dark clouds. Multiple distinct, forked bolts of lightning strike the canyon floor, accompanied by frequent, diffuse sheet lightning that illuminates the clouds from within. These flashes reveal the canyon's deep, stratified red and ochre walls. A distinct column of rain is backlit by the lightning, appearing as a shimmering, almost solid curtain of water against the dark sky. On the distant horizon, a steady orange glow, likely light pollution from a distant town, adds to the atmospheric drama.",
