    "pre_caption": "A man with curly, dark brown hair and a beard sits in profile at a desk, focused on his work. He is wearing a black turtleneck sweater and is actively typing on a vintage black typewriter. He is seated in a wooden director's chair with a white canvas back. In the background, a dark-colored purse with a metallic clasp hangs on the wall, which is striped with shadows from window blinds. Papers are scattered on the floor around his desk. In the foreground, the top of a vintage rotary phone is partially visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is extremely accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"man\" and precisely describes his key visual attributes: \"curly, dark brown hair,\" a \"beard,\" and his clothing as a \"black turtleneck sweater.\" The objects in the scene are also identified and described with high accuracy, including the \"vintage black typewriter,\" the \"wooden director's chair with a white canvas back,\" the \"dark-colored purse with a metallic clasp,\" and the \"vintage rotary phone.\" The man's action, \"actively typing,\" is also a correct description of what is happening.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete and provides a comprehensive overview of the video's content. It successfully captures the main subject in detail while also including important secondary subjects and environmental elements that define the scene's character and composition. Mentioning the \"papers scattered on the floor,\" the \"shadows from window blinds,\" and the partially visible phone in the foreground adds valuable context and depth, painting a full picture for the reader.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is rich with detail without being overly long.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The primary focus is on the man and the objects directly related to his activity, as instructed.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives. The phrase \"focused on his work\" is an acceptable inference based on his posture and action (typing at a desk) and describes his state of activity rather than an unverifiable emotion.\n*   **Specific and Detailed:** The language is very specific (e.g., \"wooden director's chair with a white canvas back\" instead of just \"chair\").\n*   **Subject Prioritization:** It correctly starts with the main subject (the man) and then describes other objects based on their relevance and location (foreground, background), which is an excellent way to structure the description.\n*   **Handling of Background:** The inclusion of background and foreground details (shadows, purse, phone) is justified as they are significant features that help establish the setting and atmosphere of the scene, which is consistent with the instruction to only include them when necessary.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example of what was requested. It is a clear, detailed, and objective description that effectively synthesizes the visual information from the video into a coherent paragraph.",
