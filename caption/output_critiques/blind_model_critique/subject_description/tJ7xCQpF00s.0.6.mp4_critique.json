    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a dark, narrow, and wet urban alleyway. The scene is framed by the towering, shadowy walls of adjacent buildings, creating a strong sense of confinement that leads the eye toward a brightly lit opening in the far distance. The ground is slick with rainwater, forming puddles that reflect the dim, cool-toned light, while numerous large dumpsters and trash bins line the path, adding to the gritty, neglected atmosphere. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the environment itself, emphasizing the moody, cinematic quality and the stark contrast between the dark foreground and the distant light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the general scene as a dark, wet urban alleyway, it misses several key visual details and relies too heavily on subjective interpretation, which the instructions advise against. For instance, it describes the light as 'dim, cool-toned,' but the video clearly shows the primary light source is a single, flickering, warm-red neon sign from a bar visible in the brightly lit opening, and this red hue is what reflects in the puddles on the asphalt ground. The claim that there is 'no main subject' is also inaccurate; while the focus is on the environment, the brightly lit opening itself serves as a distinct focal point, and the description completely overlooks a black cat that briefly walks from right to left across the mid-ground. Furthermore, the description could be more specific about the visual attributes of the environment. Instead of just 'towering, shadowy walls,' it should mention that the buildings are made of dark red brick, with visible water stains and faded white graffiti on the left wall. The 'large dumpsters' are specifically dark green, metallic containers with open lids, from which black trash bags are spilling onto the ground. Replacing subjective phrases like 'gritty, neglected atmosphere' and 'moody, cinematic quality' with these objective details would provide a more factual and precise description of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dark, narrow, and wet urban alleyway framed by towering walls of dark red brick buildings, marked with water stains and faded white graffiti on the left side. The primary light source is a flickering, warm-red neon sign from a bar visible in the brightly lit opening at the far end, casting a red hue that reflects in the puddles on the asphalt ground. Numerous dark green, metallic dumpsters with open lids line the path, with black trash bags spilling onto the ground. A black cat briefly walks from right to left across the mid-ground, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The brightly lit opening serves as a distinct focal point, drawing the viewer's eye through the alleyway.",
