    "pre_caption": "This video features a surreal architectural scenery shot, capturing a forward-moving perspective through a long, narrow corridor. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all uniformly covered in small, pale green square tiles, creating a sterile and disorienting grid that extends into the distance. The sequence begins at the base of a short flight of tiled stairs partially submerged in dark, murky water, which quickly recedes to reveal the full length of the brightly lit, hazy tunnel. Further down the corridor, a series of glowing, oval-shaped lights line the walls, leading the eye toward a dark, rectangular doorway at the very end. The video lacks a main subject because its focus is on conveying the strange, dreamlike atmosphere of the environment itself. The camera's movement serves to emphasize the scale, repetitive patterns, and unsettling nature of this liminal space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is good in some respects but fails on a critical instruction, making it unsuitable.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the long corridor, the uniform pale green square tiles on all surfaces, the short stairs, the dark water that recedes, the glowing oval lights, and the dark rectangular doorway at the end. The description of the camera's forward movement and the water receding is also a correct representation of the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It captures not only the static elements of the scene but also the primary action (the water receding to reveal the tunnel). It successfully builds a comprehensive mental picture of the environment from start to finish.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has significant flaws.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly follows the instruction for a scenery shot by identifying it as such and explaining why there is no main subject.\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph and does not use forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It uses precise terms for the subjects (e.g., \"corridor,\" \"tiles,\" \"stairs,\" \"lights\").\n    *   The descriptions of visual attributes are specific and objective (e.g., \"pale green square tiles,\" \"glowing, oval-shaped lights,\" \"dark, rectangular doorway\").\n    *   It correctly describes a key transition (the water receding to \"reveal the full length of the... tunnel\").\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Major Violations):**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The most critical failure is the violation of the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption is filled with interpretive and emotional language. Words like **\"surreal,\" \"sterile,\" \"disorienting,\" \"strange,\" \"dreamlike,\"** and **\"unsettling\"** describe the *feeling* or *interpretation* of the scene, not its objective visual properties.\n    *   **Use of Interpretive Concepts:** The phrase **\"liminal space\"** is a conceptual interpretation, not a direct visual description, which also goes against the spirit of objective reporting.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**No, the caption is not good.**\n\nWhile it is accurate, complete, and follows several structural rules, it fundamentally fails the core instruction to be objective and avoid subjective, emotional, or interpretive language. The repeated use of words like \"surreal,\" \"unsettling,\" and \"dreamlike\" is a direct and significant violation of the guidelines, making the caption unacceptable. A good caption would describe the exact same visual elements (green tiled hall, receding water, lights) but would omit all the words that tell the reader how to feel about the scene.",
