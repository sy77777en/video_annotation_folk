    "pre_caption": "The video displays two central figures with atypical appearances. A small, insect-like character with a white, horned head or mask, a black body, and a red cloak is perched atop a significantly larger creature, holding a thin, nail-like weapon. This mount is a large, pale, segmented arthropod-like being with a rounded front section featuring two simple black eyes. Numerous smaller, indistinct dark figures, some resembling bells or shells, crowd the space below and above these central subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully identifies the two central subjects and provides a decent overview of their appearance, it could be improved by removing subjective phrasing and adding more specific visual and action-based details that would be present in a video. The opening phrase \"atypical appearances\" is an unnecessary subjective judgment and should be omitted. The description of the mount as a \"segmented arthropod-like being\" is a bit clinical and potentially inaccurate; if the video shows a creature with a large, smooth carapace, describing it as a \"large, pale beetle-like creature\" would be more precise than \"segmented.\" The caption portrays a static moment by stating the character \"is perched atop\" the creature, which feels more like a description of a still image. A video would likely show motion, so describing the action, such as \"rides on the back of a large creature that is walking forward,\" would be more accurate. Furthermore, while the \"smaller, indistinct dark figures\" are mentioned, their behavior is not. If these figures are writhing or reaching up from below, this is a critical detail that establishes a relationship with the main subjects and defines the scene's atmosphere, and it should be included. Finally, the description of the main character's cloak could be more detailed; beyond its red color, mentioning if it is tattered at the edges or flowing behind the character as they move would add valuable texture to the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features two central figures with distinctive appearances. A small, insect-like character with a white, horned head or mask, a black body, and a red cloak that flows behind them rides on the back of a large, pale beetle-like creature with a smooth carapace and two simple black eyes. The character wields a thin, nail-like weapon. The creature moves forward, creating a dynamic scene. Numerous smaller, dark figures, some resembling bells or shells, writhe and reach up from below, adding to the atmosphere and interaction with the main subjects.",
