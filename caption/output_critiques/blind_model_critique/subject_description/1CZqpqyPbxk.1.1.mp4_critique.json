    "pre_caption": "The video features a person with short hair, viewed in profile, holding a camera close to their face. The scene is captured in a green night vision effect, giving it a monochromatic appearance. The person appears to be concentrating on taking a photograph, with their head slightly tilted forward. The camera is held with both hands, and the person's facial features are partially visible due to the lighting. The overall focus is on the act of photography in a low-light setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **good** but could be improved for stricter adherence to the instructions. It successfully captures the main subject and action but includes some minor interpretation and thematic summary that could be refined.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is accurate based on the content it describes. It correctly identifies a person with a camera, the profile view, and the distinct green night vision effect. The use of \"person\" is an appropriate and accurate choice when gender is not discernible.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is fairly complete, describing the main subject (\"person\"), their key attributes (\"short hair,\" \"profile view\"), their action (\"holding a camera close to their face\"), and the primary object (\"camera\"). It provides enough detail for a viewer to understand the scene's core components.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is concise and written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"person,\" \"camera\") and provides good descriptive attributes (e.g., \"short hair,\" \"green night vision effect,\" \"held with both hands\").\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the most salient subject.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Avoidance of Interpretation:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\" and \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n    *   The phrase \"**appears to be concentrating**\" is an interpretation of the person's internal state based on their posture. A more objective description, sticking purely to visual facts, would be: \"The person's head is tilted forward as they look through the camera.\"\n*   **Describing the Subject vs. the Theme:** The instruction asks for a \"description of the subjects in this video.\"\n    *   The final sentence, \"**The overall focus is on the act of photography in a low-light setting**,\" is a thematic summary or a meta-commentary about the video's intent. It describes the *concept* of the video rather than the visual attributes of the subjects within it. This sentence should be removed to adhere more strictly to describing only what is visually present. The preceding sentences already convey this theme through objective description.\n\n### Revised Caption Example:\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that more closely follows all instructions:\n\n\"A person with short hair is shown in profile, holding a camera with both hands close to their face. The entire scene has a monochromatic green night vision effect. The person's head is tilted slightly forward, and their facial features are partially visible.\"",
