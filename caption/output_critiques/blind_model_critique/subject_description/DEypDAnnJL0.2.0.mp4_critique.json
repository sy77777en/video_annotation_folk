    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with light skin and long, curly blonde hair. She is wearing a loose, cream-colored knit sweater.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively follows the provided instructions by creating a clear, concise, and accurate description of the video's subject.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is successful:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the subject as a woman with light skin, long curly blonde hair, and a cream-colored knit sweater. It correctly notes her different positions (sitting on the floor, standing by a door) and her general orientation and expression (neutral, focused, facing the door).\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive for a single subject. It covers her physical appearance, clothing, actions, and general demeanor without adding extraneous details about the background. It successfully synthesizes information from different moments in the video into one coherent paragraph.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that is easy to understand.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the salient subject (the woman) and her key visual attributes, as instructed.\n    *   **Avoidance of Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and frame-specific references (e.g., \"in the first part\"). Instead, it uses the phrase \"At different points,\" which is an excellent way to describe changes over time.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional language. \"Neutral and focused\" is a good, objective description of her facial expression and gaze, rather than speculating on her feelings.\n    *   **Descriptive Detail:** It provides specific details about the subject's hair (\"long, curly blonde\"), clothing (\"loose, cream-colored knit sweater\"), and actions (\"sitting on the floor and looking upward,\" \"standing close to a door and facing it\"), which aligns perfectly with the instructions.",
