    "pre_caption": "The main subject of this video is an elderly man with long white hair in a topknot and a long, full white beard, who stands in the center of the scene. He wears a long, dark gray, open-front robe over white undergarments, with a black sash at his waist. He stands with a stern expression, his hands held behind his back. To his left stands a younger man with black hair, a mustache, and a goatee, wearing a dark blue robe with light gray sleeves and a white yin-yang symbol on the chest. In the foreground, viewed from over the right shoulder, is a person with dark hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing a dark blue top and facing the two men.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the three main subjects and their relative positions, it could be improved by adding more specific visual details that appear to be present. For instance, the elderly man's \"dark gray, open-front robe\" could be described more precisely as a \"heavy, charcoal-colored wool robe with wide sleeves,\" and his \"white undergarments\" as a \"white, high-collared tunic visible at the neck and wrists.\" His stance is not just standing; he appears to be in a formal, authoritative posture, with his feet set apart and his back perfectly straight. The younger man's \"dark blue robe\" seems to be made of a lighter, silk-like material, and the \"white yin-yang symbol\" is a distinct, embroidered emblem positioned over his left breast. His posture is more deferential, with a slight inclination of his head. The description of the foreground subject as \"a person\" is too vague; based on the slender frame and the way the ponytail is styled with a decorative tie, it could be identified as a \"young woman.\" Her \"dark blue top\" appears to be a sleeveless, form-fitting training garment, and her visible left hand is clenched into a fist at her side, suggesting tension. Adding these specifics would provide a much richer and more accurate depiction of the scene's characters and their silent interaction.",
