    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a laundry room with two people at the center. One person, a man, is seated on a bench, wearing a white shirt, light-colored pants, and a cap, with a relaxed posture. The other person, standing nearby, is holding a laundry basket and wearing a dark outfit. The room has a checkered floor and several washing machines along the walls. Pink text reading \"KODAK ONHA\" appears prominently in the foreground, partially obscuring the people, and seems to be added in post-production.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a wide shot of a laundry room with two people in the center, the pink text title \"KODAK ONHA\" shows up and covers part of two people, which was added in post-production.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is very good, but there are a few minor areas where it could be improved to align more perfectly with the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as a laundry room, the two people, their postures and clothing, the checkered floor, the washing machines, and the prominent pink text in the foreground. All details mentioned are factually correct based on the video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive. It successfully captures all the salient subjects and elements of the scene: the two main people, the key foreground text, and the defining features of the environment. It provides enough detail to form a clear mental picture of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption effectively balances brevity with descriptive detail.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It correctly prioritizes the people and the prominent text as the main subjects.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, neutral language (e.g., \"relaxed posture\") and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Clear Subject Distinction:** It clearly distinguishes between the two people by describing their posture, actions (\"seated,\" \"standing,\" \"holding a laundry basket\"), and clothing.\n    *   **Avoids Speculation:** It correctly refrains from describing details that are not visible, such as facial expressions or specific features obscured by the cap or distance.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video features a wide shot of...\". The instruction asks for a direct description of the scene without referring to the medium itself. A more compliant opening would be to describe the scene directly, such as: \"In a laundry room with a checkered floor, two people are at the center.\"\n    *   **Interpretation vs. Description:** The phrase \"seems to be added in post-production\" is an interpretation of how the video was made, not a direct visual description. A stricter adherence to the rules would be to describe its appearance without inferring its origin, for example: \"Pink text reading 'KODAK ONHA' is overlaid in the foreground, partially obscuring the people.\"\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is excellent and follows the vast majority of the instructions very well. The points for improvement are minor and relate to a very strict interpretation of the rules. The core of the caption—its accuracy, clarity, and descriptive quality—is strong.",
