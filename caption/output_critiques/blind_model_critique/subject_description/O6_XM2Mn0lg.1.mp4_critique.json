    "pre_caption": "The video features a man dressed in dark, heavy clothing and armor, with a helmet that obscures his face and metallic elements on his arms, giving him a menacing and battle-ready appearance. He is positioned in a crouched stance, suggesting alertness or preparation for action. Near him, a sword with a long, straight blade and a crossguard is embedded upright in the ground, its hilt and blade reflecting light. The man’s attire and the sword’s placement create a striking visual contrast, emphasizing the sense of tension and readiness. Additionally, a bright, concentrated burst of blue-white light appears in the scene, casting a dramatic glow and highlighting the metallic surfaces of the man’s armor and the sword.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily the rule against using subjective and interpretive language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is flawed:\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness (Strengths):**\n\n*   **Subject Identification:** The caption accurately identifies the main subjects: a man in armor and a sword. It also correctly notes the appearance of a burst of light.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It does a good job of describing the key visual attributes of the subjects, such as the man's \"dark, heavy clothing and armor,\" \"helmet that obscures his face,\" and \"crouched stance.\" The description of the sword as having a \"long, straight blade\" and being \"embedded upright in the ground\" is also accurate and detailed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions (Weaknesses):**\n\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** This is the most significant failure. The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words and phrases like:\n    *   \"**menacing** and **battle-ready** appearance\": These are interpretations of the subject's mood and state, not objective visual facts.\n    *   \"**suggesting** alertness or preparation for action\": This is an inference about the subject's intent rather than a direct description of his pose.\n    *   \"**striking** visual contrast\": \"Striking\" is a subjective judgment.\n    *   \"emphasizing the sense of **tension** and **readiness**\": This is an analysis of the scene's atmosphere, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   \"**dramatic** glow\": \"Dramatic\" is a subjective adjective.\n\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** The caption includes an entire sentence dedicated to interpretation: \"The man’s attire and the sword’s placement create a striking visual contrast, emphasizing the sense of tension and readiness.\" This sentence adds no new descriptive information and should be removed to comply with the instructions for conciseness and objectivity.\n\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\" While not explicitly forbidden, the instructions favor a more direct description that avoids such introductory phrases.\n\nIn conclusion, while the caption correctly identifies the subjects and some of their visual details, its heavy reliance on subjective, interpretive, and emotional language makes it a poor fit for the given instructions. A good caption would describe the man's armor, his crouched pose, the sword in the ground, and the burst of light using only neutral, objective language.",
