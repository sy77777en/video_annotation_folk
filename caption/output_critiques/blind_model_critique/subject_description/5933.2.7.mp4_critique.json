Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few minor flaws in its adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and precisely describes the visual elements present: an open field, patches of water, dry golden grass, a sky with scattered clouds, and bare trees on the horizon. The description is factually correct based on the visual information.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully covers all the key aspects of the scenery, from the ground to the sky, providing a comprehensive overview of the environment. It leaves no significant visual element undescribed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption correctly follows the specific rule for scenery shots by identifying the type (\"landscape scenery shot\"), describing the environment, and explaining the lack of a main subject (\"The focus is on the overall mood and scale...\").\n    *   It successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" and \"frame.\"\n    *   It uses precise, clear terms for the subjects (\"field,\" \"water,\" \"grass,\" \"trees\").\n    *   It provides good descriptive attributes (\"dry, golden grass,\" \"bare trees,\" \"scattered clouds\").\n    *   It is formatted correctly as a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The primary weakness is the violation of the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several subjective and interpretive words:\n        *   \"expansive\"\n        *   \"vastness\"\n        *   \"serene\"\n        *   Phrases like \"adding depth and atmosphere\" and \"emphasizing the natural environment\" are also interpretive rather than purely descriptive.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption could be more concise. The final sentence, while following the instruction to explain the focus, is a bit wordy. The instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative description,\" and removing the interpretive language would also make it more direct.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is good because it accurately identifies the scene type and its components. However, it fails to fully adhere to the instructions by including subjective, emotional, and interpretive language, which was explicitly forbidden. A better caption would be more objective and stick strictly to describing the visual facts.",
