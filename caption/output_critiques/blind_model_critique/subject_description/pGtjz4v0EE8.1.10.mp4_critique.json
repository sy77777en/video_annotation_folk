    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide-angle, time-lapse cityscape scenery shot centered on a magnificent cathedral square. The primary structure is an immense Gothic cathedral with an incredibly ornate facade made of white and dark-striped marble, featuring three large arched portals, numerous sculptures, and spires reaching toward the sky. A large, circular stained-glass rose window sits prominently above the central entrance, and a tall, striped bell tower becomes visible as the camera pulls back. The sky is a brilliant blue, filled with fluffy white clouds that drift rapidly across the frame, while people move as blurs across the expansive stone plaza. There is no single main subject, as the fisheye perspective and time-lapse technique are used to capture the overwhelming scale and dynamic atmosphere of the entire architectural ensemble. The focus is on the grandeur of the environment and the passage of time within it, rather than on any specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a wide-angle, time-lapse of a cathedral square, it contains several inaccuracies and missed opportunities for detail. The use of subjective adjectives like \"magnificent\" and \"incredibly ornate\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional language. The term \"mirrored window\" is likely incorrect for a Gothic cathedral; a more precise description would be a \"large rose window\" or \"circular stained-glass window,\" which might appear dark and reflective from a distance. The description of the time-lapse effect is incomplete; a key visual element in such a video would be the long, sweeping shadows cast by the cathedral and surrounding structures, which would be seen moving rapidly across the plaza, a detail that is entirely omitted. Furthermore, the assertion that there is \"no single main subject\" is questionable. The immense, centrally-framed cathedral is unequivocally the primary subject of the shot; the time-lapse and fisheye lens are techniques used to emphasize its scale and relationship with its environment, not to diminish its role as the focal point. The caption should be restructured to describe the cathedral as the main subject. Lastly, describing the sky as just \"brilliant blue\" is an oversimplification for a time-lapse, which would likely show a dynamic shift in light and color as the day progresses, such as the sky warming in tone or the light softening.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases a wide-angle, time-lapse view of a cathedral square, with the immense Gothic cathedral as the central focus. The cathedral's facade is crafted from white and dark-striped marble, featuring three large arched portals, numerous sculptures, and spires reaching skyward. A prominent circular stained-glass rose window sits above the central entrance, and a tall, striped bell tower becomes visible as the camera pulls back. The time-lapse captures the dynamic movement of long, sweeping shadows cast by the cathedral and surrounding structures across the expansive stone plaza. The sky transitions through a spectrum of colors and light as the day progresses, with fluffy white clouds drifting rapidly across the frame. People move as blurs, emphasizing the passage of time and the grandeur of the architectural ensemble. The video highlights the cathedral's scale and its relationship with the environment, using the time-lapse and fisheye lens to enhance its prominence as the main subject.",
