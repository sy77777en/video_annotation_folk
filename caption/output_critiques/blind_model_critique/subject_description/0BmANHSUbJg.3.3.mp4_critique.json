    "pre_caption": "The video features a large aircraft, specifically a cargo plane, positioned prominently within an indoor setting. The plane is metallic with visible rivets and a distinct nose section. It bears the text \"NORSK FREIGHT\" on its side, indicating its purpose. The aircraft is surrounded by a cloud of smoke or mist, suggesting activity or a process occurring around it. In the foreground, there are several white cargo containers with red and black markings, labeled with \"MUST BE\" and \"N\" symbols, indicating their contents or handling instructions. The scene is illuminated by overhead industrial lights, casting a warm glow over the entire area. The setting appears to be a hangar or a similar facility, emphasizing the industrial and logistical nature of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent and detailed evaluation of the caption. Here is a breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows most of the complex instructions closely. It successfully creates a clear mental image of the video's content. However, there are a few minor areas where it deviates from a strict interpretation of the rules, primarily by including interpretation rather than pure description.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"large aircraft, specifically a cargo plane\" and the secondary subjects as \"white cargo containers.\"\n*   **Excellent:** It accurately transcribes the visible text (\"NORSK FREIGHT,\" \"MUST BE,\" \"N\") and describes key visual attributes like the plane's \"metallic\" surface with \"visible rivets\" and the \"red and black markings\" on the containers.\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the \"cloud of smoke or mist\" and the \"overhead industrial lights\" casting a \"warm glow\" is also a precise reflection of the visual information.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is very complete. It covers all the salient subjects and their most important features without getting bogged down in excessive detail. It successfully prioritizes the main subject (the plane) while still providing sufficient information about the secondary subjects (the containers) and the immediate environment (smoke, lighting).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths (What the caption did well):**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of information in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"cargo plane\" and \"cargo containers\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It details key visual attributes (metallic, rivets, colors, text) as instructed.\n*   **Structure and Prioritization:** It correctly starts with the most prominent subject (the plane) and then moves to the secondary subjects in the foreground.\n*   **Forbidden Words:** It successfully avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Background Description:** It mentions the \"hangar\" and \"industrial lights,\" which is a justified use of the exception provided in the instructions (\"unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships\"). The indoor hangar setting is crucial for contextualizing why a large plane is surrounded by containers and smoke in this manner.\n\n**Areas for Minor Improvement (Where it deviates from the instructions):**\n*   **Avoids Interpretation/Speculation:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption includes several phrases that are interpretive rather than purely descriptive:\n    *   \"...**indicating its purpose.**\" (Referring to the \"NORSK FREIGHT\" text). A stricter caption would just state the text is present.\n    *   \"...**suggesting activity or a process occurring around it.**\" (Referring to the smoke). A more compliant description would simply state, \"The aircraft is surrounded by a cloud of smoke or mist.\"\n    *   \"...**indicating their contents or handling instructions.**\" (Referring to the container labels). This is a logical assumption but still an interpretation of the symbols' function.\n    *   \"...**emphasizing the industrial and logistical nature of the subjects.**\" This final clause is an analytical summary of the scene's theme, not a direct visual description. It explains the *meaning* of the scene rather than just what is visible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is of high quality and largely successful. Its primary strength is its accurate and well-structured description. The minor flaw is its tendency to add logical interpretations (e.g., the purpose of text, the meaning of smoke) which, while helpful for a human reader, technically violate the strict instruction to describe only what is visible. To be perfectly compliant, the interpretive phrases should be removed, leaving only the direct visual facts.",
