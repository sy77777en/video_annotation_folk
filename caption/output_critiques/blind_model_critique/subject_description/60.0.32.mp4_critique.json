    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman in a dynamic action pose, wearing a blue soccer jersey with the number 9, white shorts, and red socks. She is captured mid-air in a stadium setting, suggesting she is playing soccer. Her hair is tied back, and she appears to be leaping or kicking. The scene transitions to a cozy bedroom where a framed photo of the same woman in action is placed on a wooden bedside table next to a white lamp. The room is softly lit, with string lights visible in the background, creating a warm and personal atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the two main scenes and the central subject, but it could be more precise and objective. In the first scene, describing the action as simply \"leaping or kicking\" is vague; the video shows the woman with dark skin executing a specific and powerful mid-air bicycle kick, with her body parallel to the ground and her face showing intense concentration. The caption also omits the white team crest visible on the left side of her blue jersey. The description of the transition is missing; the video uses a slow dissolve, where the arc of the soccer ball blends into the curved shade of the lamp, creating a smooth visual link between the two contrasting environments. For the second scene, the caption uses subjective and emotional language like \"cozy,\" \"warm,\" and \"personal atmosphere,\" which violates the instructions. Instead, it should focus on the tangible subjects. The main subject here is the framed photo itself, which is in a simple black wooden frame on the bedside table. The description could also be more specific about the \"white lamp,\" noting its modern, cylindrical base and fabric shade, and the \"string lights,\" which are small, golden fairy lights draped across a dark-colored headboard directly behind the table, making them a distinct visual element rather than just a background feature.",
