    "pre_caption": "In a pixel art video game scene, a character with brown hair, a red shirt, and brown pants stands on a green putting mat inside a wooden room. The setting is atypical for golf, as the room is lined with several cannons on carriages, each partially covered by a red cloth. An older, white-haired man with glasses, wearing a blue shirt, is also present, sitting in a chair in the upper part of the room. The game's user interface is visible, featuring an image of a golden \"Antique Putter\" in the lower-left, a yellow power bar at the bottom center, and an icon of a white golf ball with a red dot labeled \"MAT\" in the lower-right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It is accurate, highly detailed, and follows most of the complex instructions well. It successfully creates a clear mental image of the video game scene. However, there are two minor violations of the instructions that prevent it from being perfect.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **High:** The description is specific and internally consistent, painting a plausible picture of a scene from a pixel art game (potentially something like *Golf Story*). It accurately identifies the art style, the subjects (two characters), key objects (cannons, putting mat), and user interface (UI) elements. The details provided for each element are precise and factual.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is exceptionally complete. It doesn't just mention the main character but also describes the secondary character, the unusual environmental objects (cannons), and the crucial UI elements that provide context for the game. Describing the \"Antique Putter,\" the power bar, and the ball icon is a fantastic detail that fulfills the instruction to describe key visual attributes.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, coherent paragraph without feeling bloated.\n*   **Structure and Flow:** The description is logically structured. It starts with the main subject (the player character), expands to the setting, introduces the secondary subject (the older man), and finishes with the UI. This follows the principle of prioritizing subjects effectively.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"character,\" \"man,\" \"cannons on carriages,\" \"putting mat,\" and \"power bar,\" avoiding vague language.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent visual details for all subjects:\n    *   **Player Character:** \"brown hair, a red shirt, and brown pants stands...\"\n    *   **Older Man:** \"older, white-haired man with glasses, wearing a blue shirt... sitting in a chair...\"\n    *   **Objects:** \"cannons on carriages, each partially covered by a red cloth,\" \"golden 'Antique Putter',\" \"yellow power bar,\" \"white golf ball with a red dot.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It correctly returns a single paragraph with no Markdown or introductory text.\n\n**Areas for Improvement (Violations of Instructions):**\n\n*   **Use of a Forbidden Term:** The instruction explicitly states, \"**avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.**\" The caption violates this rule by saying, \"...featuring an **image** of a golden 'Antique Putter'...\"\n    *   **Correction:** This could be easily fixed by rephrasing it to: \"...featuring a depiction of a golden 'Antique Putter'...\" or more simply, \"...featuring a golden 'Antique Putter' icon...\"\n\n*   **Use of a Subjective Adjective:** The instruction states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" While \"atypical\" isn't an emotional adjective, it is a subjective judgment about the scene rather than a purely objective description. The instruction's goal is to describe *what is there* and let the reader draw their own conclusions.\n    *   **Correction:** The sentence \"The setting is atypical for golf, as the room is lined with several cannons...\" could be made more objective by simply stating the facts: \"The character stands on a green putting mat inside a wooden room that is also lined with several cannons on carriages...\" The reader will naturally conclude that cannons are atypical for a golf setting without being told.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is of high quality and demonstrates a strong understanding of the core requirements. Its detailed and structured description is its greatest strength. By correcting the two minor issues—removing the word \"image\" and the subjective adjective \"atypical\"—the caption would be a perfect execution of the instructions.",
