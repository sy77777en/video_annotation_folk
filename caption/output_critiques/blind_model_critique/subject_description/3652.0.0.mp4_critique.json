    "pre_caption": "The video features a stylized puppet character with exaggerated facial features, including large eyes and a prominent nose. The puppet has short, dark hair and is wearing a red plaid jacket over a dark shirt. It is seated at a table with two blue cups on a tray. The puppet's head is turned slightly, suggesting it is looking to the side. The setting appears to be a dining area, but the focus remains on the puppet character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nPlease note that the main subjects in this video exhibit **atypical appearance**, so the description should focus on them. Don't mention the background scene and detailed subject's motion.\n",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres almost perfectly to the given instructions. It is a high-quality description that is accurate, complete, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its descriptions. It identifies the subject as a \"stylized puppet character,\" which is a precise and appropriate term.\n*   The visual attributes are described with factual, objective language (e.g., \"red plaid jacket,\" \"dark shirt,\" \"two blue cups\").\n*   It correctly uses cautious phrasing like \"suggesting it is looking to the side\" and \"The setting appears to be,\" which aligns with the instruction to avoid describing what you are unsure about.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete. It covers the main subject's key features (exaggerated face, hair), clothing, and pose (\"seated at a table,\" \"head is turned slightly\").\n*   It successfully includes secondary subjects (\"two blue cups on a tray\") without letting them dominate the description.\n*   It provides just enough context about the setting (\"dining area\") while correctly stating that the focus remains on the puppet, as instructed.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, clear, and coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. **(Excellent)**\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The focus is squarely on the puppet character, its attributes, and its immediate surroundings, exactly as required. **(Excellent)**\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids \"image\" and \"frame.\" While it begins with \"The video features,\" this is a natural and acceptable way to introduce a video description and is not explicitly forbidden by the rules. **(Good)**\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. \"Stylized\" and \"exaggerated\" are objective descriptors in this context. **(Excellent)**\n*   **Subject Identification and Attributes:** It uses precise terms (\"puppet character,\" \"cups\") and describes their visual attributes in great detail, following the instructions perfectly. **(Excellent)**\n*   **Prioritization:** The caption correctly prioritizes the main subject (the puppet) by describing it in detail first, then briefly mentioning the secondary objects (cups). **(Excellent)**\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text. **(Excellent)**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is detailed yet concise, objective, and clearly structured. There are no significant errors or deviations from the rules. It successfully captures the essential visual information of the scene in a way that is easy for a reader to understand and visualize.",
