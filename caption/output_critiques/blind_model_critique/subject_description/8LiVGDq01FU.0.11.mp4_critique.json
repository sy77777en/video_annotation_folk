    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with light skin and reddish-brown hair styled in a loose bun. She is wearing a brown jacket over a blue shirt. Her expression appears focused as she looks to her left. The video captures her in a seated position initially, and then she begins to stand up, with the focus shifting to her jacket as she moves. The setting is dimly lit, emphasizing her profile and clothing details.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a very good caption. It is well-written, descriptive, and follows most of the instructions closely. However, there are a few minor areas where it could be improved for stricter adherence.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the caption accurately reflects the video's content, it is excellent. It provides specific, verifiable details about the subject's appearance (light skin, reddish-brown hair in a bun), clothing (brown jacket, blue shirt), and actions (seated, begins to stand, looks left). The use of \"appears focused\" is a good choice, as it describes the visual impression without making an unverifiable claim about the woman's internal state.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully creates a clear mental image of the subject and her actions throughout the video. It covers all the key attributes requested for a person: skin tone, hairstyle and color, clothing, pose, orientation, and expression. It also effectively describes the change in her state from sitting to standing.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres to the instructions very well, but with a few minor deviations:\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet packed with useful information.\n    *   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subject as a \"woman\" and describes her key attributes in detail.\n    *   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes the action (\"seated initially, and then she begins to stand up\") without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Describing Filmmaking Techniques:** The phrase \"...with the focus shifting to her jacket as she moves\" describes a camera technique (a focus pull) rather than an attribute of the subject. The instruction is to focus on the subjects themselves. A more compliant phrasing would describe the *result* of this action, such as, \"As she stands, the details of her jacket become the clearest part of the scene.\"\n    *   **Describing the Background and Interpreting Intent:** The caption mentions, \"The setting is dimly lit, emphasizing her profile and clothing details.\" The instruction states not to mention the background unless necessary. While the dim lighting is a visual fact, the second part of the phrase (\"emphasizing her profile...\") is an interpretation of the filmmaker's artistic intent, which borders on subjective analysis. A stricter adherence would be to simply state, \"She is in a dimly lit space,\" and let the description of the subject imply the visual effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent and highly effective. The feedback points are minor and relate to a very strict interpretation of the rules. For most purposes, this caption would be considered perfect. The deviations are subtle and do not significantly detract from its overall quality, but they are worth noting for perfect adherence to the provided instructions.",
