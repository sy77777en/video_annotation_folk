    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a fast-paced, low-altitude flight over a vibrant, sunlit rural countryside. The view skims just above rolling green fields, bordered on one side by a dense forest and on the other by scattered trees leading up to a small village nestled on a distant hill under a bright blue sky. The rapid forward motion creates a significant blur, particularly at the edges of the view, which emphasizes the exhilarating speed of the journey. This focus on the immersive experience of movement through the environment means there is no single main subject; instead, the atmosphere of a swift flight across the expansive, verdant landscape takes precedence.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw that prevents it from being perfect.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and precisely describes the visual elements: a low-altitude flight over a rural area with \"rolling green fields,\" a \"dense forest,\" a \"small village on a distant hill,\" and a \"bright blue sky.\" The description of the motion—\"fast-paced,\" \"skims just above,\" \"rapid forward motion,\" and \"significant blur\"—accurately captures the dynamic nature of the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by not only identifying the type of scene but also explaining *why* there is no main subject. The final sentence, \"This focus on the immersive experience of movement... means there is no single main subject,\" perfectly fulfills this requirement. It provides a comprehensive overview of the entire scene and its atmosphere.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions well, but it fails on one key point.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and provides an informative description of the scene.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the video as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Forbidden Words:** It correctly avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and explains the absence of a main subject, focusing instead on the environment and atmosphere.\n*   **Use of Motion:** It appropriately describes motion (\"fast-paced,\" \"blur\") because it is essential for characterizing the nature of the shot and explaining the lack of a static subject.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The primary flaw is the violation of the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several:\n    *   **\"vibrant\"**: This word implies a subjective quality of energy and life, not just color. A more neutral alternative would be \"bright green\" or \"brightly colored.\"\n    *   **\"exhilarating\"**: This is a direct violation, as it explicitly describes an emotion or feeling associated with the journey.\n    *   **\"immersive\"**: This describes a subjective quality of the experience rather than an objective visual attribute.\n\nIn summary, the caption is well-structured, accurate, and mostly compliant with the rules. However, its use of subjective and emotional adjectives (\"vibrant,\" \"exhilarating,\" \"immersive\") is a clear and significant deviation from the instructions. To be considered a \"good\" caption under the given rules, these words would need to be removed or replaced with objective, descriptive language.",
