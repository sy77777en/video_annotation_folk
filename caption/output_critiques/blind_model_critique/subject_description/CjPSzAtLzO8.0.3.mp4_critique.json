    "pre_caption": "Two motorcyclists are seen racing on a track. One rider is dressed in a red, white, and black racing suit with a matching helmet. The other rider wears a purple, black, and white racing suit, also with a matching helmet. Both are in a forward-leaning racing posture on their respective motorcycles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the number of subjects (two), their type (motorcyclists), their action (racing), and their specific visual attributes (suit colors, posture).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is good but incomplete. While it provides excellent detail about the riders' suits, helmets, and posture, it completely omits any description of the motorcycles themselves. The instructions state to describe objects by their \"color, material, shape, and distinguishing features.\" The motorcycles are central subjects, not just background elements, and their colors, numbers, or any other visible features should have been included to provide a more complete picture.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres well to most of the instructions, but with one key omission.\n\n*   **Strengths (What it does well):**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet effectively conveys the core scene.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It correctly uses the precise term \"motorcyclists.\"\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It does an excellent job of differentiating the two riders by the distinct colors of their racing suits (\"red, white, and black\" vs. \"purple, black, and white\").\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives and sticks to factual visual details.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame,\" and it doesn't speculate on things that aren't visible.\n    *   **Pose and Action:** It correctly describes the \"forward-leaning racing posture,\" which is a key visual attribute.\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Where it falls short):**\n    *   **Omission of Key Objects:** The primary failure is not describing the motorcycles. As central components of the scene, their visual attributes (e.g., \"a red and white motorcycle,\" \"a black motorcycle with the number 46\") are essential details that were missed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **good but not great**. It successfully follows most of the complex instructions regarding style, tone, and structure. Its strength lies in clearly and objectively describing the human subjects and differentiating between them. However, its failure to describe the motorcycles—which are equally important subjects in this context—makes the description incomplete and prevents it from fully meeting the requirements of the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two motorcyclists are seen racing on a track. One rider is dressed in a red, white, and black racing suit with a matching helmet, riding a sleek red and white motorcycle. The other rider wears a purple, black, and white racing suit, also with a matching helmet, and is on a black motorcycle featuring the number 46. Both are in a forward-leaning racing posture on their respective motorcycles, showcasing their speed and agility.",
