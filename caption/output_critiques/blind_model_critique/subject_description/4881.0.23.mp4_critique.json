    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a man with a light skin tone, dark curly hair, a mustache, and a short beard, who is seated in the center. He wears a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top and purple trousers. He has white nail polish on his fingernails and is looking directly forward while bringing a coupe glass containing a pinkish liquid to his lips. Surrounding him are several other people. To his left, another man in a colorful patterned shirt and orange pants is partially visible. Behind the main subject, a woman with dark hair and glasses holds a cigarette, and further back, another person wears a hooded garment and sunglasses. To the right, a woman in a green pleated top is partially in view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the four main individuals and their basic attributes, it could be improved by providing more specific details about their actions, their relationship to the camera, and their positions within the frame to create a more vivid and complete picture of the scene. For instance, stating the main subject is \"looking directly forward\" is ambiguous; it would be more precise to say he is \"looking directly into the camera,\" which changes the tone of the video. The description of his action could also be more definitive; instead of just \"bringing a coupe glass... to his lips,\" the video might show him taking a slow, deliberate sip. The secondary subjects are described as \"partially visible,\" but this could be clarified. The man on the right might be mostly out of frame with his back turned, and the woman in the green top could be in the soft-focus foreground, creating a sense of depth. Furthermore, the description of the woman with the cigarette could specify if the cigarette is lit or unlit, as an unlit cigarette suggests a different mood or moment in time. Finally, small but significant details might be missing, such as a lime wedge garnish on the coupe glass or the fact that the \"colorful patterned shirt\" on the man to the right is a vibrant, tropical floral print, which would add to the overall atmosphere of the gathering.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The main subject, a man with a light skin tone, dark curly hair, a mustache, and a short beard, is seated prominently in the center of the frame. He wears a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top and purple trousers, with white nail polish on his fingernails. He is looking directly into the camera, creating an engaging connection with the viewer, while taking a slow, deliberate sip from a coupe glass containing a pinkish liquid, garnished with a lime wedge. To his left, another man, mostly out of frame with his back turned, wears a vibrant, tropical floral print shirt and orange pants. Behind the main subject, a woman with dark hair and glasses holds a lit cigarette, adding a sense of casual relaxation to the scene. Further back, another person in a hooded garment and sunglasses adds an air of mystery.
