    "pre_caption": "The video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot, moving forward through a long, dark, and symmetrical hallway. The corridor is lined with numerous identical closed doors on either side, with thin slivers of light seeping from underneath them. The floor is dark and highly reflective, mirroring the stark contrast between the shadowy foreground and the intensely bright, white light emanating from an open doorway at the very end of the hall. The focus is entirely on the environment and the feeling it evokes, using the strong leading lines and dramatic lighting to create a sense of mystery, infinity, or passage. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to draw the viewer's eye through the space itself, making the atmosphere and the journey toward the light the central experience. The stark, monochromatic aesthetic emphasizes form and contrast over specific details, further centering the environmental mood.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an atmospheric scenery shot of a hallway, it misses several key visual details and oversimplifies the scene. The description of the movement as just \"moving forward\" is too generic; the video actually features a very slow, perfectly smooth dolly shot that enhances the eerie, cinematic quality. The caption mentions \"identical doors,\" but it fails to note the tarnished brass numbers visible on each one, a detail that adds a layer of specificity to the environment. Furthermore, while it notes \"some doors open,\" it completely omits that through one of the slightly ajar doors on the left, the back of an empty, dark wooden chair is visible, which constitutes a secondary subject and contradicts the claim that there is \"no main subject.\" The description of the light is also incomplete; it mentions \"slivers of light\" but misses the crucial detail that the light seeping from under one specific door flickers with a distinct red hue, contrasting sharply with the steady white light from the others and the bright light at the end of the hall. Finally, the caption's tone becomes overly analytical, explaining concepts like \"leading lines\" and \"monochromatic aesthetic\" instead of sticking to a direct, objective description of the visual content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a hauntingly atmospheric scene as the camera glides forward with a slow, smooth dolly shot through a long, dark, and symmetrical hallway. The corridor is lined with numerous closed doors, each marked with tarnished brass numbers, adding a layer of specificity to the environment. Thin slivers of light seep from underneath the doors, with one door emitting a distinct flickering red hue, contrasting with the steady white light from the others. On the left, a slightly ajar door reveals the back of an empty, dark wooden chair, introducing a secondary subject that adds to the mystery. The highly reflective floor mirrors the stark contrast between the shadowy foreground and the intensely bright, white light emanating from an open doorway at the end of the hall.
