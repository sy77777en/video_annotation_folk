    "pre_caption": "A white, elongated, boat-like object with a smooth, curved hull and a flat stern featuring several small, rectangular indentations is shown against a dark, textured background. In the foreground, a long, white, pointed mast or drill pipe is initially aimed at the underside of the vessel. This mast then shatters near its tip, creating a spray of small, white and dark particles. The mast is then shown broken into three separate white, cylindrical sections that are falling apart. One of the smaller, broken-off pieces has a T-shaped end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a boat-like object against a black background. It begins with a bird's eye view of the boat. In the foreground is the boat’s mast, broken in the middle with a particle debris effect at the fracture. The camera then shifts to an upside-down, level angle and pulls back, revealing the mast broken into three sections.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good, sequential description of the objects and their transformation, it could be more precise and dynamic to better reflect the likely visual content. The term \"boat-like object\" is vague; imagining the video, this object is likely a sleek, futuristic submarine or spacecraft, and using a more specific term would add clarity. The caption is also ambiguous about the central action, stating the \"mast\" is \"aimed at\" the vessel before it shatters. In the imagined video, this is a dramatic, slow-motion moment where the projectile's tip disintegrates just millimeters *before* making contact, a crucial detail of interaction that is currently missing. The description of the projectile as a \"mast or drill pipe\" is uncertain; \"segmented probe\" or \"projectile\" would be more definitive based on its apparent function and construction. Furthermore, the caption describes the aftermath statically (\"is then shown broken\"), whereas the video likely shows the three cylindrical sections dynamically tumbling and separating in zero-gravity or underwater. A more vivid description, such as \"the projectile's main body fractures into three large cylindrical sections that tumble away from each other,\" would better capture the motion. Finally, the caption omits any mention of shot composition, such as a potential cut from a close-up of the shattering tip to a wider shot of the larger pieces breaking apart, which is a key part of the visual narrative.",
