    "pre_caption": "The video features a person engaged in construction work. The individual, whose skin tone is medium, is wearing a light-colored hat and a patterned garment. They are holding bricks, one in each hand, with visible text imprinted on one of the bricks. The scene includes a partially constructed brick wall and a container with cement. The person appears to be standing on a concrete surface, possibly a staircase, with scattered bricks and construction materials around them. The setting suggests an outdoor environment with some greenery visible nearby.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but has several clear flaws and fails to adhere to some of the most critical instructions. While it successfully captures the general activity and identifies the main subjects in a single paragraph, it violates key rules regarding speculation, inclusion of background details, and the level of descriptive detail required for the human subject.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Violation:** The caption includes speculative language. The phrase \"**possibly a staircase**\" directly contradicts the instruction: \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" A correct caption would either describe what is clearly visible (e.g., \"standing on a concrete surface with steps\") or omit the detail if it's not certain.\n*   **Violation:** The phrase \"**The setting suggests an outdoor environment**\" is an inference rather than a direct description of a visible subject. The instruction asks for a description of subjects, not interpretations of the setting.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Incomplete:** The description of the person is incomplete according to the instructions. The instructions ask for details on \"hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression.\" The caption only provides skin tone (\"medium\") and clothing. If these other details were not discernible, the caption would be acceptable, but it's more likely they were omitted.\n*   **Vague:** The descriptions \"**light-colored hat**\" and \"**patterned garment**\" lack the specificity requested. The instructions ask for \"specific and descriptive language.\" A better caption would specify the color of the hat (e.g., \"white,\" \"beige\") and describe the pattern (e.g., \"a blue and white striped shirt,\" \"a floral print top\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly focuses on the person and the construction materials.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"video.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses clear terms like \"person,\" \"bricks,\" \"wall,\" and \"container.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives that convey emotion.\n*   **Subject Order:** It correctly prioritizes the main subject (the person) before describing the surrounding objects.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Describing Uncertainty:** As mentioned, using \"**possibly a staircase**\" is a direct violation of the rule against describing what you are unsure about.\n*   **Including Unnecessary Background:** The instruction states, \"**Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary.**\" The final sentence, \"**The setting suggests an outdoor environment with some greenery visible nearby,**\" describes the general background, which is not essential for understanding the primary subject and their actions. The focus should remain on the person and their immediate workspace.\n*   **Lacking Specific Visual Attributes:** The caption fails to provide a detailed description of the person as required. It also uses vague terms like \"light-colored\" and \"patterned\" instead of the specific details the instructions demand.",
