    "pre_caption": "The video features a man wearing a brown hat, sunglasses, and a brown jacket. He has a goatee and is holding a silver object close to his face, appearing to speak into it. The man is positioned prominently in the foreground, facing slightly to the side. In the latter part of the video, he is seen from behind, walking away down a tree-lined street. The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and greenery visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few minor areas for improvement to perfectly align with the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a man and accurately describes his key visual attributes (brown hat, sunglasses, brown jacket, goatee) and his actions (holding a silver object, appearing to speak, walking away). The description of the scene changing is also accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses a few details:\n*   It describes the change in the video's content (\"In the latter part of the video, he is seen from behind...\") but fails to mention the **type of shot transition** (e.g., hard cut, fade) as specifically requested by the instructions.\n*   While it describes the man's clothing and facial hair, it omits other potential details like his approximate age or skin tone, which are part of the detailed instructions for describing people.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most of the rules but deviates from a few.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear, brief summary of the video's content.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered on the man, the primary subject.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Natural Language:** The language is simple, clear, and easy to understand.\n*   **Single Paragraph:** It is formatted correctly as one coherent paragraph.\n*   **No Subjectivity:** It avoids adjectives that convey emotion or opinion.\n*   **Combines Scenes:** It effectively synthesizes the close-up shot and the walking shot into a single narrative without referring to specific frames.\n\n**Where the caption could be improved:**\n*   **Unnecessary Background Description:** The final sentence, \"The setting suggests an urban environment with buildings and greenery visible,\" describes the general background. The instructions state to avoid describing the background \"unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" In this case, it is not necessary and should be omitted.\n*   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\". A more direct approach, starting immediately with the subject (e.g., \"A man wearing a brown hat...\"), is more concise and in line with the goal of a direct description.\n*   **Missing Transition Type:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" it fails to specify the type of shot transition, which was a specific requirement in the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man wearing a brown hat, sunglasses, and a brown jacket, with a goatee, holds a silver object close to his face, appearing to speak into it. He is prominently positioned in the foreground, facing slightly to the side. The video transitions with a hard cut to show him from behind, walking away down a tree-lined street. He appears to be in his 30s with a light skin tone.",
