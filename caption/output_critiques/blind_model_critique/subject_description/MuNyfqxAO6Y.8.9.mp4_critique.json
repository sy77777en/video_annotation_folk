    "pre_caption": "A close-up view shows the interior of a car with a two-tone color scheme. The dashboard, door panel, and A-pillar are upholstered in a dark, forest-green material that has a soft, suede-like texture. A contrasting panel on the passenger side of the dashboard, encompassing the glove compartment, is covered in a salmon-pink or terracotta-colored suede. A small, rectangular \"AIRBAG\" label is embossed on this pink section. The passenger-side wing mirror, visible in the background, is also colored dark green.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and follows the specified formatting and stylistic rules with a high degree of precision.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the subject as the \"interior of a car\" and precisely names its components: \"dashboard,\" \"door panel,\" \"A-pillar,\" \"glove compartment,\" and \"wing mirror.\"\n*   The descriptions of visual attributes are specific and believable. \"Dark, forest-green,\" \"salmon-pink or terracotta-colored,\" and \"suede-like texture\" are descriptive and demonstrate careful observation. The inclusion of the embossed \"AIRBAG\" label is a specific, verifiable detail that adds to the accuracy.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete, capturing all the salient features of the scene. It establishes the overall \"two-tone color scheme\" and then details which parts correspond to which color.\n*   It successfully synthesizes information into a cohesive whole, describing the car's interior as a single subject rather than a collection of disparate parts. Mentioning the wing mirror's color is a great touch, as it reinforces the color scheme and provides a more comprehensive view.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption strikes a perfect balance. It is a single, dense paragraph packed with specific details without being overly long.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the car's interior components, as instructed.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, professional, and easy to understand.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The caption uses objective language. Phrases like \"suede-like\" and \"salmon-pink or terracotta-colored\" are excellent examples of describing appearance without making unverified claims about the exact material or hue. It avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   **Precise Terminology and Attributes:** It excels here, using precise terms (\"A-pillar,\" \"embossed\") and describing key attributes (color, texture, markings) in detail.\n*   **Clarity and Structure:** The description is logically structured. It starts with a general overview (\"two-tone color scheme\") and then describes the dominant color group before moving to the contrasting accent color. This makes the description easy to follow.\n*   **Handling of Background Elements:** The instruction states to avoid mentioning the background unless necessary. Here, mentioning the \"passenger-side wing mirror, visible in the background\" is justified because it is a key part of the car that reinforces the described color scheme. The phrasing is clear and adds value.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is descriptive, objective, and well-structured, providing a clear and comprehensive understanding of the video's subject matter. There are no significant areas for improvement.",
