    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a dimly lit attic bedroom, characterized by its rustic and cozy atmosphere. The video lacks a main subject, as the static, wide-angle view is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural character of the space. The room features a sloped white ceiling with exposed dark wooden beams and a large, central skylight that provides the main source of natural light, revealing a glimpse of green foliage outside. To the left, a bed with a black metal frame is softly illuminated by a warm bedside lamp. In the background, a wall of simple white closet doors stands opposite a small wooden desk and chair in the right foreground, creating a sense of a quiet, lived-in space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent and detailed feedback. Here is a breakdown of the caption's performance based on the provided instructions:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the setting as an \"interior scenery shot of a dimly lit attic bedroom\" and accurately describes the key architectural features and objects within it, such as the \"sloped white ceiling with exposed dark wooden beams,\" the \"large, central skylight,\" the \"bed with a black metal frame,\" and the \"small wooden desk and chair.\" The description of the lighting is also precise, noting it is \"dimly lit\" and mentioning both the \"natural light\" from the skylight and the \"warm bedside lamp.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by not only identifying it as such but also explaining *why* it lacks a main subject: \"the static, wide-angle view is intended to capture the overall environment and architectural character of the space.\" It covers all the major visual elements, providing enough detail to create a clear mental picture of the room.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions, but it fails on a few key points.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It describes the scene holistically without referring to specific moments in time.\n    *   It uses location-based descriptions (\"to the left,\" \"in the background,\" \"in the right foreground\") effectively to place objects.\n    *   It describes the visual attributes (color, material, shape) of the objects as instructed.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The primary violation is the use of subjective adjectives that interpret the scene's mood. The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses **\"cozy,\" \"quiet,\"** and **\"lived-in,\"** all of which describe a feeling or atmosphere rather than objective visual facts. While \"rustic\" can be a descriptor of a style, \"cozy\" in particular is an emotional interpretation that should have been avoided.\n    *   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"This is an interior scenery shot...\" The instruction asks to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A more direct and compliant caption would start immediately with the description, for example: \"An interior scenery shot of a dimly lit attic bedroom features a sloped white ceiling...\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows most of the structural and formatting rules. However, its use of subjective, atmospheric adjectives like \"cozy\" is a clear deviation from the instruction to describe only what is visible and avoid emotional language. Removing these subjective terms and the introductory phrase would make it fully compliant.",
