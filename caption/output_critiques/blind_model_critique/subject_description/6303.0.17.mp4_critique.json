    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with medium skin tone and an afro hairstyle, wearing a bright red, long-sleeved shirt. He is expressive, with his mouth open wide, possibly singing or shouting. In one instance, he raises his right arm with a clenched fist, while his left hand rests on his abdomen. The setting appears to be a room with a checkered floor and vibrant lighting, contributing to a dynamic atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the man and his primary action, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The use of subjective terms like \"expressive\" and \"dynamic atmosphere\" should be replaced with objective visual descriptions; for instance, instead of \"expressive,\" you could describe his raised eyebrows and the tension in his facial muscles. The speculation \"possibly singing or shouting\" is unnecessary, as the video clearly shows him holding a vintage-style silver microphone to his open mouth, confirming he is singing. The description of his clothing is a good start, but it misses that the red long-sleeved shirt is a sweatshirt with a small white graphic on the chest and that he is also wearing black pants and white sneakers. Furthermore, the mention of the \"checkered floor\" is a background detail that is largely out of focus and could be omitted, whereas the \"vibrant lighting\" could be more specifically described as flashing blue and purple spotlights that cast distinct shadows on the man, directly impacting his appearance rather than just contributing to an abstract \"atmosphere.\"",
