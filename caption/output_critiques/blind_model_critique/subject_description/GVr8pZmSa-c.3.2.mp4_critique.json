    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a mixed-quality caption. While it excels at describing the visual details of the subject, it fundamentally misunderstands and violates several key instructions, particularly regarding the classification of the shot and the use of subjective language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the visual elements is highly accurate and specific. Phrases like \"elongated, dark object with a textured, reddish-brown upper surface and cracked, greyish sides\" and \"partially buried in the sandy seabed\" paint a clear and precise picture of the subject. The mention of \"floating white particles resembling marine snow\" is also a very accurate and effective description.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is very complete. It describes the overall environment (deep blue water, sandy seabed), the primary subject (the large object), and secondary elements (the particles). It successfully synthesizes these details into a coherent paragraph that gives a full sense of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has significant flaws.\n\n*   **Contradictory Classification (Major Flaw):** The instructions provide two distinct paths: one for scenery shots without a salient subject, and another for shots that *do* have a salient subject. This caption incorrectly tries to follow both paths at once.\n    *   It begins by calling it an \"underwater scenery shot\" and claims the \"focus is on the dark, mysterious deep-sea environment.\" This follows the rule for scenery shots.\n    *   However, it then immediately provides a detailed, multi-line description of a very specific and salient subject (\"A large, elongated, dark object...\"). This follows the rule for shots *with* a main subject.\n    *   The final sentence, \"...emphasize the vastness and enigmatic nature of the underwater world rather than highlighting a specific, fully detailed subject,\" directly contradicts the detailed description that precedes it. The caption *did* just highlight a specific, fully detailed subject.\n    *   **Correction:** The caption should have identified the large object as the main subject and focused the entire description on it, omitting the claims that it's a scenery shot without a primary focus.\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives (Violation):** The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule by using the words **\"mysterious\"** and **\"enigmatic.\"** These words describe an interpretation or feeling about the scene, not a visual attribute.\n\n*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** While the language is clear, the contradictory structure makes the caption's purpose confusing. The first and last sentences are unnecessary and inaccurate framing for the excellent descriptive content in the middle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is not good.**\n\nWhile the core description of the object is excellent and adheres to the rules for detailing visual attributes, the caption's overall structure is fundamentally flawed. It misclassifies the video type according to the provided instructions, leading to a self-contradictory paragraph. Furthermore, it violates the explicit rule against using subjective, emotional language. A good caption would have simply described the salient object without the confusing and inaccurate \"scenery shot\" framing.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a large, elongated, dark object with a textured, reddish-brown upper surface and cracked, greyish sides, partially buried in the sandy seabed of a deep-sea environment. The scene is set against deep blue water, with floating white particles resembling marine snow, creating a sense of depth and scale. The dim lighting highlights the object's features, making it the focal point of the underwater setting.",
