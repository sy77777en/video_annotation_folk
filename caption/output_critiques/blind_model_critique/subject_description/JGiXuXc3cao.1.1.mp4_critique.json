    "pre_caption": "A digital interface on a black screen displays a white grid over a dark, marbled background. In the center, the words \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" are shown in glowing red text, next to a pulsating red circle that marks a location. White text boxes on the grid indicate the coordinates \"LONG: 50.14\" and \"LAT: 41.46\". In the bottom right corner, a timestamp progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME\". As time advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the initial red circle. A white, diamond-shaped compass symbol is visible in the bottom left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the primary textual and graphical elements of the digital interface, it may be under-describing the dynamic nature and potential narrative complexity of the video. The description of the red circle as \"pulsating\" and the text as \"glowing\" is a good start, but the video might feature more nuanced animations, such as a subtle flicker in the \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" text or a faint, sweeping scan line effect across the grid, reminiscent of a radar, which are not mentioned. The term \"marbled background\" feels slightly generic; if the video shows a more technical display, a description like \"a dark background with faint, topographical contour lines\" might be more accurate. Furthermore, the description of the dotted red line \"extend[ing] vertically upwards\" is very specific and could be incorrect; in the video, this line likely represents the ship's drift and might extend at a slight angle or even curve subtly as the time progresses. The most significant potential omission is the lack of other interacting subjects. A video depicting the Titanic's distress call would plausibly show another icon, perhaps a green triangle representing the Carpathia, appearing on the grid and moving towards the red circle as the timestamp advances, a crucial narrative detail that is currently missing. The appearance of small, white 'x' marks on the grid over time, indicating reported iceberg locations, would also be a key visual element that the caption fails to capture.",
