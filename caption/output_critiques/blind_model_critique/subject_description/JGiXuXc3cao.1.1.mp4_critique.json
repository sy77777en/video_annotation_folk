    "pre_caption": "A digital interface on a black screen displays a white grid over a dark, marbled background. In the center, the words \"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL\" are shown in glowing red text, next to a pulsating red circle that marks a location. White text boxes on the grid indicate the coordinates \"LONG: 50.14\" and \"LAT: 41.46\". In the bottom right corner, a timestamp progresses from \"10:35PM NYC TIME\" to \"12:35AM NYC TIME\". As time advances, a dotted red line extends vertically upwards from the initial red circle. A white, diamond-shaped compass symbol is visible in the bottom left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to all the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the visual elements of the digital interface, including the background, grid, text content (\"TITANIC DISTRESS CALL,\" coordinates, timestamp), colors (black, white, red), shapes (grid, circle, line, diamond), and visual effects (glowing, pulsating).\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It captures not only the static elements but also the key dynamic actions in the video—the progression of the timestamp and the extension of the dotted red line. It successfully synthesizes the entire sequence into one coherent summary.\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is direct and packed with specific details without being wordy.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"digital interface\" and then describes its components in detail.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Appropriate Use of Motion:** It describes motion (\"progresses,\" \"extends,\" \"pulsating\") because it is essential to understanding the video's content.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The caption uses descriptive, objective words (\"glowing,\" \"pulsating,\" \"dotted\") rather than subjective or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Clarity and Structure:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, natural English. The description follows a logical order, starting with the overall scene, moving to the central focus, and then detailing the peripheral and dynamic elements.\n    *   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"digital interface,\" \"white grid,\" \"text boxes,\" and \"compass symbol.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is factual, detailed, and structured perfectly to give a clear and complete understanding of the video's content.",
