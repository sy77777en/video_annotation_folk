    "pre_caption": "The video shows a close-up of a wooden cutting board with a person slicing a cucumber into thin, half-moon pieces using a large knife. The person's hands are visible, focusing on the cutting action. In the foreground, there are fresh vegetables, including a red tomato, a bunch of green lettuce, and a purple-tipped onion, arranged neatly. The scene emphasizes the preparation of fresh ingredients, with the cucumber slices accumulating on the board as the cutting progresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent and detailed feedback. Here is a breakdown of the caption's performance based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good, but it has a few minor issues that prevent it from perfectly adhering to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the primary and secondary subjects: the person's hands, the wooden cutting board, the large knife, the cucumber being sliced, and the other vegetables in the foreground (red tomato, green lettuce, purple-tipped onion). The description of the action (\"slicing a cucumber into thin, half-moon pieces\") and the result (\"cucumber slices accumulating\") is precise and true to the likely visual content.\n\n**Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe description is comprehensive. It not only focuses on the main action but also includes the surrounding context, which is crucial for a full understanding of the scene. By mentioning the other vegetables, it paints a complete picture of food preparation. It successfully synthesizes the entire action of the video into a coherent summary without needing to reference specific moments.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Good**\n\nThe caption follows most of the rules well, but it violates a few key constraints.\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a lot of detail in a short paragraph.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"wooden cutting board,\" \"large knife,\" \"red tomato\") and avoids vague language.\n    *   **Attribute Description:** It gives specific visual attributes like material (\"wooden\"), color (\"red,\" \"green,\" \"purple-tipped\"), and shape (\"half-moon pieces\").\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Single Paragraph:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n*   **Where it could be improved:**\n    *   **Violation:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\" This is introductory text, which the instructions explicitly forbid. The description should start directly with the subjects in the scene.\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"The scene emphasizes the preparation of fresh ingredients...\" is interpretive. The instructions ask for a description of visual facts, not an analysis of the scene's intent or emphasis. The description should let the visual details speak for themselves.\n    *   **Minor Issue:** The word \"fresh\" is slightly subjective, but it is a common and acceptable descriptor for produce in this context. \"Neatly\" is also subjective but serves to describe the physical arrangement of the objects. These are minor points compared to the other violations.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of how the caption could be revised to perfectly match all instructions:\n\nOn a wooden cutting board, a person's hands use a large knife to slice a cucumber into thin, half-moon pieces. The accumulating slices of cucumber are visible on the board. In the foreground, a red tomato, a bunch of green lettuce, and a purple-tipped onion are arranged together.",
