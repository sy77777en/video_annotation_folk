    "pre_caption": "The video features an elderly woman wearing a patterned headscarf and a gray cardigan over a dark dress with a floral design. She is holding an umbrella with a decorative pattern. In one part of the video, she is bending down, possibly interacting with the ground, as she holds a small brown object in her hand. Her posture suggests she is focused on something at her feet. The setting appears to be outdoors, with grass visible around her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them. Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully follows several key instructions but fails on one critical point and has minor issues with another.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption appears to be accurate. It describes an elderly woman, her specific clothing, an umbrella she is holding, and her actions. Without viewing the video, it's impossible to verify these details, but the description itself is plausible and specific.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a good level of detail about the main subject. It covers her apparent age, gender, clothing (cardigan, dress, headscarf), and the objects she holds (umbrella, small brown object). It also describes a key action (bending down). It correctly focuses on the most salient subject as instructed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that gives a clear picture of the subject and her actions.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the \"elderly woman\" and her attributes, avoiding unnecessary details about the background.\n*   **Formatting and Language:** It adheres to the one-paragraph format, uses simple and natural English, and avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses a precise term (\"elderly woman\") and describes her attributes in detail.\n*   **Temporal Change:** It effectively describes a change in the subject's action over time (\"In one part of the video, she is bending down...\") without referring to specific frames.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** This is the most significant flaw. The instruction states, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" The caption violates this rule twice:\n    1.  \"...**possibly** interacting with the ground...\" — The word \"possibly\" is speculative. The caption should only describe the observable action, which is \"bending down toward the ground.\"\n    2.  \"Her posture **suggests** she is focused...\" — Describing what a posture \"suggests\" is an interpretation of the subject's mental state, not a visual description. The instruction is to describe the pose itself (e.g., \"She is bent at the waist, looking down at her feet\").\n*   **Unnecessary Background/Hedging:** The final sentence, \"The setting **appears to be** outdoors, with grass visible around her,\" is problematic.\n    1.  The phrase \"appears to be\" is a form of hedging that indicates uncertainty, which should be avoided.\n    2.  While mentioning the background can be acceptable if it's necessary for context, this sentence feels slightly tacked on. A better way to incorporate this detail would be to integrate it with the action, for example: \"she is bending down over a patch of grass.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is well-structured, detailed, and follows most of the formatting and content guidelines. However, its use of speculative language (\"possibly,\" \"suggests\") is a direct violation of a core instruction. To be considered a great caption according to the rules, it must be revised to state only what is visually verifiable.",
