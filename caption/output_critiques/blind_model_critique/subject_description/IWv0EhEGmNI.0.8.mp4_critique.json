    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with light skin, a full beard, and a mustache, wearing a dark cap. He appears to be middle-aged and is shown in profile, facing to the right. His expression is neutral and focused, and his head is slightly tilted downward. The lighting highlights the contours of his face, emphasizing his facial hair and the brim of his cap. The man remains the central subject throughout the video, with no other human subjects visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It adheres to all the instructions provided and creates a clear, accurate, and detailed mental image of the video's content.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"middle-aged man\" and precisely describes his key visual features: \"light skin,\" \"a full beard, and a mustache,\" and a \"dark cap.\" The description of his pose (\"in profile, facing to the right\") and expression (\"neutral and focused\") is also spot-on. The observation about the lighting highlighting his features is an accurate detail that adds to the description's quality.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It covers all the necessary details about the main subject as outlined in the instructions, including gender, estimated age, skin tone, facial hair, clothing (headwear), pose, orientation, and expression. It also correctly notes that he is the sole subject, which provides important context about the video's focus.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is rich with detail without being wordy.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The description is entirely focused on the man, who is the only salient subject.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the man's consistent appearance throughout the video (\"remains the central subject\") rather than focusing on a single moment.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject identification (\"man\").\n*   **No Speculation:** It uses cautious and appropriate language like \"appears to be middle-aged\" and avoids making assumptions about things that are not visible.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective, emotional adjectives. \"Neutral and focused\" describes a visual state rather than an internal feeling.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Handling of a Single Subject:** The caption correctly identifies that there is one central subject and dedicates the entire description to him, which is the proper approach according to the instructions.",
