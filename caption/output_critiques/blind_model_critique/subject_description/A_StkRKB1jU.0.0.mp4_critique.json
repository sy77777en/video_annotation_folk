    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the essence of an urban environment. It features a collection of towering skyscrapers with varied architectural designs, including sleek glass facades and more traditional concrete structures. The focus is on the scale and atmosphere of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the grandeur and complexity of the urban landscape, drawing attention to the environment as a whole rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and the key event, it relies too heavily on subjective and interpretive language, such as \"dramatic,\" \"striking,\" \"surprising,\" and \"grandeur,\" which violates the instruction to avoid emotional adjectives. The description of the building is vague; it fails to mention specific visual attributes I saw, such as its sleek, rectangular shape and its dark blue, highly reflective glass that mirrors the orange and purple clouds of the sunset. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the shattering event with more detail. In the video, the panel on an upper floor doesn't just shatter, it first develops a large spiderweb crack that spreads rapidly before the glass implodes inward, followed by a shower of tiny fragments falling down the building's face. Furthermore, the final sentence is redundant and overly analytical, describing the \"essence of the city\" and \"complexity of the urban landscape\" instead of sticking to concrete, observable details from the video, such as the other visible skyscrapers, which are a mix of older, stone-faced buildings and modern glass towers, or the traffic lights changing on the street far below. A better caption would focus on these specific, objective visual facts to create a clearer picture.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a cityscape featuring a collection of skyscrapers with varied architectural designs. One prominent building stands out with its sleek, rectangular shape and dark blue, highly reflective glass that mirrors the orange and purple clouds of the sunset. A dramatic event unfolds as a panel on an upper floor develops a large spiderweb crack, rapidly spreading before the glass implodes inward, followed by a shower of tiny fragments cascading down the building's face. The scene also includes a mix of older, stone-faced buildings and modern glass towers, with traffic lights changing on the street far below, adding to the dynamic urban environment.",
