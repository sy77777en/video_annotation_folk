    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the essence of an urban environment. It features a collection of towering skyscrapers with varied architectural designs, including sleek glass facades and more traditional concrete structures. The focus is on the scale and atmosphere of the city, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the buildings. The absence of a main subject emphasizes the grandeur and complexity of the urban landscape, drawing attention to the environment as a whole rather than any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It masterfully follows the specific and complex set of instructions, particularly the rule for describing a scenery shot.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the scene as a \"cityscape scenery shot.\"\n*   The description of \"towering skyscrapers with varied architectural designs, including sleek glass facades and more traditional concrete structures\" is precise and paints a clear picture of a modern city.\n*   Mentioning the \"interplay of light and shadow\" is a valid and objective visual detail that adds to the description's quality.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete for a video that fits its description (a scenery shot with no main subject). It provides a holistic overview of the urban environment, which is the focus of such a video. It successfully describes the \"subjects\" (the buildings) as a collective whole.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** The caption follows this rule perfectly. It identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and then uses the final two sentences to \"explain why there is no main subject... by noting that the focus is on the environment, atmosphere, or scale,\" as explicitly requested by the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is concise, clear, and written in a single, coherent paragraph using simple, natural English.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids forbidden words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"video\" (except in the initial, slightly redundant classification). It also avoids mentioning \"background\" or \"motion.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective emotional adjectives. Words like \"towering,\" \"sleek,\" and \"varied\" are used as objective descriptors of physical or stylistic attributes. \"Grandeur\" and \"complexity\" are used appropriately within the context of explaining the *purpose* of the shot, as permitted by the instructions.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subjects as \"skyscrapers\" and describes their key visual attributes (material, design) without getting lost in unnecessary detail, which is appropriate for a wide scenery shot.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the provided instructions. It correctly identifies the video type and executes the specific rule for that type with precision and clarity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures the essence of an urban cityscape, showcasing a diverse array of towering skyscrapers with sleek glass facades and traditional concrete designs. The focus is on the city's scale and atmosphere, highlighting the dynamic interplay of light and shadow across the buildings.
