    "pre_caption": "The video presents a landscape scenery shot of a stylized wilderness. The perspective emerges from a dark, rocky cave to reveal a tranquil valley. A gentle river, shrouded in a low-lying mist, flows between grassy banks and reddish-brown rock formations. The scene is bordered by a forest of tall, green pine trees under a soft, cloudy sky, all rendered in a warm, painterly art style. There is no main subject, as the focus is on immersing the viewer in the serene atmosphere and the beauty of the natural environment itself, creating a sense of discovery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw that prevents it from being perfect.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It paints a clear and vivid picture of a stylized landscape, detailing specific elements like a cave, a misty river, rock formations, and pine trees. The mention of a \"painterly art style\" and an \"emerging\" perspective accurately captures the visual and dynamic nature of the scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully:\n*   Identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot,\" which is the correct classification according to the instructions for a video without a salient subject.\n*   Describes the key environmental elements (cave, river, mist, banks, rocks, trees, sky).\n*   Notes the \"reveal\" transition as the perspective \"emerges from a dark, rocky cave.\"\n*   Follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by explaining *why* there is no main subject: \"the focus is on immersing the viewer in the... atmosphere and the... natural environment.\"\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but it fails on one critical point.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is clear and provides a strong sense of the scene without being overly long.\n*   **Vocabulary:** It correctly avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It uses motion (\"emerges,\" \"flows\") only where necessary to describe the scene's dynamic nature.\n*   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole, not as a sequence of frames.\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and provides the required explanation for the lack of a main subject.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption violates this rule by using several such words:\n    *   \"**tranquil** valley\"\n    *   \"**gentle** river\"\n    *   \"**serene** atmosphere\"\n    *   \"the **beauty** of the natural environment\"\n\nWhile these words effectively describe the mood of the scene, they are subjective and emotional, which is explicitly forbidden. A better caption would describe the visual facts that *create* this feeling, rather than naming the feeling itself. For example, instead of a \"gentle river,\" it could describe the river as \"slow-moving\" or having a \"smooth surface.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good** because it is well-structured, comprehensive, and follows most of the complex instructions. However, it is **not perfect** due to its repeated use of subjective, emotional adjectives, which is a direct violation of a key negative constraint in the instructions. To be fully compliant, it would need to remove words like \"tranquil,\" \"gentle,\" \"serene,\" and \"beauty.\"",
