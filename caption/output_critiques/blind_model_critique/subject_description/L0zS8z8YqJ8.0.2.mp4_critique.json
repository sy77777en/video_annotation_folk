    "pre_caption": "A row of at least five identical, human-like soldier figures are shown from the waist up. The figures appear to be made of a shiny, silver-colored metal, giving them a statuesque quality. Each soldier wears a military helmet and a uniform with a high collar and straps crossing the chest. They are all positioned standing at attention in a straight line, facing forward and slightly to their left. The view pulls back to reveal that the soldiers are seen through a white-framed window, as if they are passengers inside a train car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows five human-like soldiers appearing to be made of metal, with only their upper torsos visible. The camera then zooms out, revealing a small portion of an object resembling a train and showing human-like subjects visible through the train window.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"human-like soldier figures\" rather than assuming they are robots or people in costumes. It accurately describes their material (\"shiny, silver-colored metal\"), their uniform (\"military helmet,\" \"high collar,\" \"straps\"), their pose (\"standing at attention\"), and their collective arrangement (\"in a straight line\"). The description of the camera movement (\"The view pulls back\") and the resulting reveal (\"seen through a white-framed window\") is also precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the subjects' appearance, posture, and the key dynamic element of the video—the reveal. By mentioning they are seen \"from the waist up,\" it provides a clear sense of the initial framing. The phrase \"at least five\" is a good choice, as it is descriptive without making an unverified claim about the total number.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is easy to read and understand.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their immediate context, as instructed.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n    *   **Handling of Motion/Reveals:** It correctly follows the instruction to describe motion when it's essential for context. The \"pull back\" is a crucial part of the video's narrative, revealing the window and changing the viewer's understanding of the scene. This is handled perfectly.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective emotional adjectives. \"Statuesque quality\" is an effective descriptive term that refers to their stillness and form, not an emotion.\n    *   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific visual details (color, material, clothing style, pose) for the figures.\n    *   **Handling of Multiple Subjects:** It correctly treats the identical figures as a collective group (\"A row of... figures\"), which is the most efficient and logical way to describe them.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The phrase \"as if they are passengers inside a train car\" is a reasonable and helpful comparison based on the visual evidence (a row of figures seen through a window). It is phrased as a simile (\"as if\") rather than a statement of fact, which keeps it from being speculative.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is descriptive, accurate, and structured precisely as requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A row of at least five identical, human-like soldier figures is shown from the waist up, crafted from shiny, silver-colored metal, giving them a statuesque appearance. Each soldier is equipped with a military helmet and a uniform featuring a high collar and chest-crossing straps. They stand at attention in a straight line, facing forward and slightly to their left. As the view pulls back, it reveals the soldiers are seen through a white-framed window, suggesting they are passengers inside a train car.",
