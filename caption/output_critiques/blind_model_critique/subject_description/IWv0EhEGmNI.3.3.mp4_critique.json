    "pre_caption": "The video features a first-person perspective. It begins with a wide shot showing a glowing rope being thrown into a valley, with distant buildings and trees visible. The scene transitions to a medium close-up of a hand holding a gun, with the hand appearing to be wearing a glove. The gun is pointed downward, and the camera angle is high, providing a wide view of the valley and capturing a rooftop below. The setting is dark, with a greenish tint, suggesting night vision or a similar effect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a first-person perspective throughout. It begins with a wide shot of a glowing rope being thrown down into a valley, showing distant buildings and trees. The camera then tilts downward, and transitions to a medium close-up of a hand holding a gun. The shot continues with a high-angle wide view of the valley, capturing a rooftop below.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the night vision effect, but it lacks crucial subject detail and misinterprets some instructions. The description of \"a gun\" is too generic; in the video, it's clearly a black assault rifle with a visible scope and suppressor, which are key visual attributes that should be included. Furthermore, by stating it's a first-person perspective, the caption should describe the visible parts of the person, such as their hands in black tactical gloves throwing the rope and later holding the rifle. The phrase \"The scene transitions to\" is vague; the video actually shows a smooth, continuous camera movement where the view tilts downward from the thrown rope to the rifle, which is a more accurate description of the action. The caption also mentions \"distant buildings and trees\" as background, but the \"rooftop below\" is the clear objective, featuring details like several large air conditioning units and a skylight, making it a secondary subject rather than simple background. Finally, the opening \"The video features...\" is unnecessary introductory text; the description should begin directly with the visual information, such as \"From a first-person viewpoint rendered in monochrome green...\" to create a more immediate and descriptive account.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a first-person viewpoint rendered in monochrome green, a pair of hands in black tactical gloves throw a glowing rope into a valley. The camera smoothly tilts downward, revealing a black assault rifle with a visible scope and suppressor. The rifle is held by the gloved hands, pointed downward. The high camera angle provides a wide view of the valley, focusing on a rooftop below, which features several large air conditioning units and a skylight. The setting is dark, enhanced by a night vision effect, with the rooftop as the clear objective amidst distant buildings and trees.",
