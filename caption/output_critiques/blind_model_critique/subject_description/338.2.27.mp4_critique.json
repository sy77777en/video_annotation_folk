    "pre_caption": "The video features a restaurant setting with several people seated at tables. The main subject is a person standing on a green hoverboard, wearing black pants and a dark shirt, positioned centrally in the scene. This person appears to be a server, as they are interacting with the tables. Around them, various patrons are seated, including a man in a striped shirt and jeans, and a woman with long blonde hair in a patterned top. The patrons are engaged in conversation and dining. On the floor, a small, round, turquoise robotic vacuum is visible, moving between the tables. The overall scene captures a busy dining environment with a focus on the server's unique mode of transportation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few minor issues that prevent it from being perfect. It successfully captures the main subjects and the overall scene, but it violates some specific negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy & Completeness:**\n\n*   **Good:** The caption is very accurate and complete in its description of the subjects. It correctly identifies a main subject (person on a hoverboard), secondary subjects (patrons), and another notable object (robotic vacuum).\n*   **Good:** It provides specific, useful details for each subject, such as the hoverboard's color (\"green\"), the person's clothing (\"black pants and a dark shirt\"), the patrons' appearance (\"man in a striped shirt,\" \"woman with long blonde hair\"), and the vacuum's attributes (\"small, round, turquoise\"). This level of detail is excellent.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Good:**\n    *   **Concise & Informative:** The description effectively combines details into a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on describing the subjects rather than the background.\n    *   **Precise Terminology:** It uses clear and precise terms like \"person,\" \"man,\" \"woman,\" and \"robotic vacuum.\"\n    *   **Prioritization:** It correctly identifies the \"person standing on a green hoverboard\" as the main subject and describes them first.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It does a great job of distinguishing between the patrons by describing their clothing and hair.\n\n*   **Needs Improvement:**\n    *   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\" The instructions state to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" A more direct start, such as \"A person stands on a green hoverboard in a restaurant...\" would be better.\n    *   **Inference vs. Observation:** The phrase \"appears to be a server\" is an inference, not a direct visual fact. The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" While the inference is logical, it's better to stick to the observable action: \"This person is interacting with the tables.\"\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The final sentence uses the words \"busy\" and \"unique.\" The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" \"Unique\" is a subjective judgment, and \"busy\" is an interpretation of the atmosphere rather than a direct visual description.\n    *   **Concluding Summary:** The last sentence, \"The overall scene captures a busy dining environment with a focus on the server's unique mode of transportation,\" acts as a summary or interpretation of the video's theme. The instructions require a direct description of visual elements, not a thematic summary.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is **good** because it is descriptive, well-structured, and mostly follows the rules. However, it is not **perfect** because it includes an unnecessary introductory phrase, makes a minor inference, and uses subjective adjectives in a concluding summary sentence, all of which are contrary to the specific instructions.",
