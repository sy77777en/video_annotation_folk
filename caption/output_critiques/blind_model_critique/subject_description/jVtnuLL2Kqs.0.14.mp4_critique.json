    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a public park or square on a bright day. A wide, paved walkway leads through the center of the frame towards a tall, light-colored monument, with a large, multi-story residential building visible in the background. The scene is framed by lush, green trees and dotted with wooden benches along the path and on the surrounding lawns, where various people appear, enjoying the park—some sit, others stroll, and a child runs. There is no single main subject; the focus is on establishing the environment and capturing the tranquil, everyday atmosphere of the urban green space. The shot emphasizes the scale and collective life of the location rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the setting as a public park on a bright day and accurately describes the main structural elements like the paved walkway, monument, and residential building, it lacks the specific detail required for the human subjects. You mention \"various people,\" including some sitting, some strolling, and a child running, but you fail to provide any of their key visual attributes. For instance, the couple sitting on the bench on the right could have been described more concretely, such as \"a man with dark hair in a blue t-shirt and a woman with blonde hair in a white sundress.\" Similarly, specifying that the child running on the lawn is wearing a bright red shirt would make the description more vivid and grounded in the visual information. The caption also includes subjective analysis, such as describing the atmosphere as \"tranquil\" and explaining that the shot's focus is on the \"collective life of the location.\" These are interpretations of the scene's mood and intent, rather than objective descriptions of what is visible, and should be omitted in favor of more detailed, factual observations that allow the reader to infer the atmosphere independently.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This cityscape scenery shot captures a public park or square on a bright day. A wide, paved walkway leads through the center of the frame towards a tall, light-colored monument, with a large, multi-story residential building visible in the background. The scene is framed by lush, green trees and dotted with wooden benches along the path and on the surrounding lawns. On the right, a man with dark hair in a blue t-shirt sits on a bench next to a woman with blonde hair in a white sundress. Various people are enjoying the park; some are strolling, and a child in a bright red shirt is running on the lawn. The focus is on establishing the environment and capturing the everyday activities within this urban green space.",
