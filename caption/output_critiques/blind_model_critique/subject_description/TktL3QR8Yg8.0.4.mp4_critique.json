    "pre_caption": "The video features a furry bear toy sitting on a carpeted floor, surrounded by miniature toys and scattered papers. A person wearing striped clothes enters the scene, visible from the waist down, moving on their knees. They pull a covered rack draped in white fabric into view and lift the fabric, revealing the lower base of a steel Ferris wheel structure. The Ferris wheel is illuminated by a warm, glowing light in the background. The person then exits the frame, leaving the bear toy facing the now fully visible Ferris wheel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens with a ground-level shot of a furry bear toy sitting on a carpeted floor, surrounded by miniature toys and scattered papers. A person wearing striped clothes enters the frame, their lower body visible as they move on their knees, pulling a covered rack draped in white fabric into view. They lift the fabric, revealing the lower base of a steel Ferris wheel structure, illuminated by a warm, glowing light in the background, before exiting the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the instructions. It is accurate, clear, and effectively describes the sequence of events and the subjects involved.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **High Accuracy:** The caption correctly identifies all the main subjects: a \"furry bear toy,\" a \"person wearing striped clothes,\" and a \"steel Ferris wheel structure.\"\n*   **Action Description:** The description of the action is precise and chronologically correct. It accurately captures the person entering, moving on their knees, pulling the covered rack, revealing the Ferris wheel, and then exiting.\n*   **Detail Accuracy:** It correctly notes that the person is only \"visible from the waist down\" and that the Ferris wheel is initially concealed by a \"white fabric.\" The detail about the \"warm, glowing light\" is also accurate.\n*   **Minor Inconsistency:** There is a slight inconsistency. The caption first states the person reveals \"the lower base of a steel Ferris wheel structure,\" but concludes with the bear \"facing the now fully visible Ferris wheel.\" This could be clarified. If only the base is revealed, \"fully visible\" is inaccurate. If the entire wheel becomes visible, the initial description could be more expansive.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Very Complete Narrative:** The caption successfully tells the short story of the video from beginning to end, covering the initial setup, the central action of the reveal, and the final scene.\n*   **Good Detail on Subjects:** It provides good key attributes for each subject (furry toy, striped clothes, steel wheel).\n*   **Areas for Minor Improvement:** To be even more complete, it could include the color of the bear toy (e.g., \"a brown furry bear toy\") and the colors of the striped clothing, if discernible. However, what is provided is sufficient for a concise description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption strikes a great balance. It's concise enough to be read quickly but informative enough to give a clear picture of the video's content.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the subjects and their attributes, using the background and motion only to provide essential context for the action.\n*   **Proper Language:** It uses simple, natural English and successfully avoids subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"interesting\"). \"Furry\" and \"warm\" are descriptive, not emotional.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or references like \"in the first scene.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption excels at not describing what isn't visible. It doesn't guess the person's gender, age, or identity, correctly stating they are \"visible from the waist down.\"\n*   **Clarity and Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph. It clearly distinguishes between subjects (\"the bear toy,\" \"a person\") and describes them in the logical order of their appearance and interaction.\n*   **Describing Transitions:** It perfectly handles the instruction to describe subjects revealing or disappearing, detailing how the person enters, reveals the Ferris wheel, and exits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is very good.** It is a high-quality description that follows the vast majority of the complex instructions with precision. Its primary strength is its clear, chronological description of the action and the reveal. The only minor point of improvement would be to resolve the slight inconsistency between revealing the \"lower base\" and the wheel being \"fully visible.\" Otherwise, it is an exemplary execution of the prompt.",
