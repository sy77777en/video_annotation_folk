    "pre_caption": "The video shows a red, square, insulated delivery bag with black straps and a black top flap placed on the floor in front of a dark gray apartment door. Two light brown cardboard boxes are stacked on top of the bag. A light-skinned man with short blond hair, wearing a pink face mask, a light gray button-up shirt over a blue t-shirt, and black pants, opens the door from the inside. He steps out, picks up the cardboard boxes, and goes back into the apartment, closing the door. A moment later, a second light-skinned man with curly dark brown hair, wearing a white hoodie, blue jeans, and a pink face mask, walks into view from the right and picks up the red delivery bag.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a red bag placed at the entrance of a closed apartment door, with a cardboard box on top of it. Then, a full shot of a man opening the apartment door, going out, picking up the cardboard box, then going back into the apartment and closing the door. Shortly after, another man walks into the frame from the right, picks up the bag at the entrance of the apartment.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a clear chronological account of the events and successfully distinguishes between the two men. However, it could be enhanced by adding more specific visual details that would likely be present. For instance, the \"red, square, insulated delivery bag\" might feature a prominent logo for a food delivery service, which would be a key identifying attribute. The description of the \"light brown cardboard boxes\" could be more precise by specifying their shape, such as clarifying if they are flat pizza boxes or stacked rectangular take-out containers. The description of the first man's action could be more vivid; instead of just \"picks up the cardboard boxes,\" it could note that he carefully balances the stack with both hands. Similarly, for the second man, the caption could specify how he holds the bag after picking it up—for example, \"grasps the bag by its top handles before walking away.\" Lastly, the phrase \"opens the door from the inside\" is an inference; a more objective description would be \"the door opens inward to reveal a man,\" as this is what is visually apparent.",
