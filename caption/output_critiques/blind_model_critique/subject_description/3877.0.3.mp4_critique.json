    "pre_caption": "The video features a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a short beard. He is wearing a light-colored cap and a dark, loose-fitting shirt over a yellow long-sleeve shirt. The man is raising one arm, and his expression appears focused and engaged. His head is slightly tilted, and he is looking in a direction that suggests he is interacting with something or someone off-screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central subject and his basic attire, it lacks the specificity and dynamic detail present in the video. The description of the man \"raising his right arm\" is an oversimplification; in the video, his arm is held aloft with his palm open and facing upward in a deliberate, performance-like gesture, as if he is pulling an invisible rope from the sky. The caption also completely omits the involvement of his left hand, which is held near his waist to counterbalance the action. The description of his clothing could be more precise; the \"light-colored cap\" is a tan baseball cap worn backward, and the \"dark, loose-fitting shirt\" is a faded black t-shirt with a barely visible graphic on the chest. Furthermore, the caption describes a static pose, but the video shows subtle movement: the man sways slightly, and his \"focused and engaged\" expression, characterized by a furrowed brow, briefly softens into a knowing smile directed toward his unseen audience. Using a more objective description like \"with a furrowed brow\" instead of the subjective \"engaged\" would better align with the instructions.",
