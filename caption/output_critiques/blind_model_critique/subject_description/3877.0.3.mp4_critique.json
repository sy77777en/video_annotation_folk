    "pre_caption": "The video features a middle-aged man with a light skin tone and a short beard. He is wearing a light-colored cap and a dark, loose-fitting shirt over a yellow long-sleeve shirt. The man is raising one arm, and his expression appears focused and engaged. His head is slightly tilted, and he is looking in a direction that suggests he is interacting with something or someone off-screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully follows many of the key instructions but fails on a few important points.\n\n### **Evaluation Breakdown:**\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the man's physical attributes (middle-aged, light skin tone, short beard) and clothing (light-colored cap, dark loose-fitting shirt over a yellow long-sleeve shirt) is accurate and detailed.\n*   The description of his pose (raising one arm, head slightly tilted) is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete in its description of the single subject. It covers his type, age, appearance, clothing, and pose, which are the most essential details as per the instructions. It correctly identifies that there is one main subject and focuses entirely on him.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a lot of detail in a short, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the man, describing his type and visual attributes in detail.\n*   **Clarity and Language:** It uses simple, natural English and is structured as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing the man's clothing with specific colors and styles.\n\n**Where the caption needs improvement:**\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** The caption violates the rule: \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The phrase \"...suggests he is interacting with something or someone off-screen\" is an inference about something not visible in the video. A better, more objective description would be: \"He is looking away from the camera.\"\n*   **Avoids Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The words \"focused and engaged\" are interpretations of the man's mental state based on his expression. A more compliant description would stick to physical facts, such as: \"His eyebrows are slightly lowered and his mouth is parted.\"\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is strong in its detailed and objective description of the man's appearance and clothing. However, it falters by including subjective interpretations of his expression (\"focused and engaged\") and speculating about off-screen actions. To be fully compliant with the instructions, these subjective and speculative elements should be removed and replaced with purely factual observations.",
