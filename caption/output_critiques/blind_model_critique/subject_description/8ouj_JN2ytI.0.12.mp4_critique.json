    "pre_caption": "A group of sports fans, predominantly light-skinned men, are clapping. Many in the crowd wear yellow beanies. A man in the foreground with a goatee wears a black collared jacket over a yellow shirt and a yellow beanie. To his right, a man with a darker skin tone wears a black jacket, a yellow scarf, and a black and yellow cap. Further to the right, a man with long dark hair and glasses wears a yellow beanie, and next to him, another man wears a purple baseball cap and a yellow t-shirt. A woman with blonde hair and a yellow headband is also in the crowd, clapping and smiling. Reflections of other people are visible in the large glass windows behind the group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects as a group of sports fans and correctly notes the recurring yellow and black team colors. However, it understates the action and misses key emotional details. The video shows the fans not just \"clapping\" but cheering with vigorous, synchronized energy, many with their arms raised. The description of the man in the foreground is good, but it omits his intense, focused expression as he watches the event. Similarly, while the woman is noted as \"smiling,\" the man with the darker skin tone has a wide, joyful grin, and the man with long hair is shouting with excitement, details that are central to the scene's atmosphere. The description of \"another blonde-haired person\" is too vague; this individual is clearly a young woman with her hair tied back in a ponytail, also wearing a yellow team scarf. Furthermore, mentioning the reflections in the windows is distracting, as the camera uses a shallow depth of field that renders the background as a soft blur, emphasizing that the focus is entirely on the passionate expressions and unified action of the fans in the foreground. A more effective description would integrate the action and emotion from the start, capturing the collective fervor of the group rather than listing individuals in a somewhat disconnected manner.",
