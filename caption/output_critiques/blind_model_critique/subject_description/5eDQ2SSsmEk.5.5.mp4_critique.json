    "pre_caption": "A large, illuminated rectangular billboard on the left prominently displays a full-body image of a woman with blonde hair and fair skin, wearing a white two-piece bikini. She poses with her hands clasped behind her head, looking slightly to her left, standing on a sandy beach with a palm tree to her right, under the large yellow text \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS.\" In the center of the scene, a dark silhouette of a man, seemingly wearing a jacket, stands facing away from the viewer. To the right, another large, illuminated billboard shows a cartoonish pink pig wearing a white chef's hat, with the text \"HAPPY PIG\" and \"0-24\" visible on a red and white background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their static attributes, it fails to capture the dynamic nature of the video, describing it more like a still photograph. The video likely shows the billboards as animated digital displays, not static images; for instance, the woman on the \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS\" ad might have hair subtly moving in a digital breeze, and the text could be scrolling or pulsing with light. Similarly, the \"HAPPY PIG\" billboard probably features the cartoon pig winking or the \"0-24\" text flashing to indicate it's a 24-hour establishment. The most significant omission is the man's action; describing him as \"standing\" is probably incorrect, as the video likely shows him walking slowly down a wet, reflective street, with the camera following him. This movement is central to the scene's narrative. The caption also misses the opportunity to establish the moody, futuristic atmosphere—the darkness of the surrounding city, the rain, and the way the billboard light casts a glow on the wet pavement—which is what renders the man a silhouette and makes the advertisements so prominent. Describing the man's silhouette as wearing \"seemingly a jacket\" is vague; the video's motion would likely define the garment more clearly as a long coat, billowing slightly as he walks. The description should prioritize the man as the primary subject moving through an environment, rather than presenting three separate, static elements in a line.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a moody, futuristic cityscape, a man in a long coat walks slowly down a wet, reflective street, his silhouette defined by the glow of vibrant billboards. On the left, an animated digital display features a woman with blonde hair in a white bikini, her hair subtly moving in a digital breeze under the large yellow text \"OFF WORLD ISLANDS,\" which pulses with light. To the right, another billboard showcases a cartoonish pink pig in a chef's hat, winking as the \"0-24\" text flashes, indicating a 24-hour establishment. The rain-soaked pavement reflects the colorful lights, enhancing the atmospheric scene as the camera follows the man's journey through the illuminated urban landscape.",
