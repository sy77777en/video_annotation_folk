    "pre_caption": "The video features two men standing side by side. The man on the left has a dark skin tone and is wearing a dark jacket over a striped shirt. He appears to be looking slightly upward. The man on the right has a medium skin tone, short hair, and a goatee. He is wearing glasses, a dark jacket, and a brown sweater. His expression is neutral, and he is facing forward. Both men are positioned closely together, suggesting they are engaged in a shared experience or conversation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two men and their general positioning, it lacks the specific detail needed to fully capture the scene. The description of their clothing is too generic; the man on the left's \"dark jacket\" is a black nylon bomber jacket with a silver zipper, and his \"striped shirt\" has thin, vertical, grey and white stripes. The man on the right's \"dark jacket\" is a charcoal grey wool blazer worn over his brown V-neck sweater. The caption also misinterprets their expressions and actions. The man on the left is not just looking \"slightly upward\" but is smiling faintly while looking up and to his right, reacting to something on a screen just out of the main view. The man on the right's expression is not neutral; he is actively speaking, with his mouth slightly open and his right hand raised in a subtle gesture, indicating he is in the middle of explaining something. Finally, the caption omits the crucial detail that both men have small, black lavalier microphones clipped to their collars, which clearly defines the context as an interview, panel, or recording session, making the final sentence about a \"shared experience\" an unnecessary and vague inference.",
