    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot focused on the side of a grey brick building in an urban alley. There is no single main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish the environment and showcase the transformation of the space. The scene is initially a plain brick wall featuring a boarded-up, arched window with a security grate, a \"NO PARKING\" sign, and a doorway on the right. Colorful, flat-style animated graphics then appear on the wall, creating a vibrant mural. This includes a large orange hand holding a pink horn that emits musical notes, a stylized fire hydrant, a blue robot-like character sitting next to a lamppost, and a large green tree held by a pink figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot focused on transformation but could be improved by providing more dynamic and specific details. The description of the graphics \"appearing\" is too passive; a more accurate description might detail how they animate onto the wall, for example, if they are \"painted\" on by invisible brushstrokes or \"grow\" into place from different points. Furthermore, key visual attributes for the animated subjects are missing. The caption should specify the color of the stylized fire hydrant (e.g., red and silver) and provide more detail on the \"blue character,\" such as its shape (e.g., a round, blob-like figure with two simple eyes) and its specific pose (e.g., leaning against the lamppost with its legs crossed). Finally, the description of the mural's components could be organized spatially to create a clearer mental image, such as describing elements from left to right or from the ground up, which would better reflect how a viewer experiences the composition unfolding.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dynamic cityscape transformation, focusing on the side of a grey brick building in an urban alley. Initially, the scene features a plain brick wall with a boarded-up, arched window secured by a grate, a \"NO PARKING\" sign, and a doorway on the right. As the video progresses, vibrant, flat-style animated graphics dynamically animate onto the wall, as if painted by invisible brushstrokes. Starting from the left, a large orange hand holding a pink horn emerges, emitting musical notes. Next, a stylized red and silver fire hydrant appears, followed by a blue, round, blob-like character with two simple eyes, leaning against a lamppost with its legs crossed. Finally, on the right, a large green tree is held by a pink figure. This spatial arrangement of elements creates a vivid mural, transforming the once plain wall into a lively and colorful scene.",
