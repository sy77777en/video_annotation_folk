    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of men seated in a row at a long table. They are all wearing similar attire, consisting of light-colored shirts and dark pants. The men have varied hairstyles, with some having short hair and others being bald. They are positioned closely together, facing the same direction, suggesting a sense of uniformity and focus. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that emphasize the collective presence of the group rather than individual features. The overall composition highlights the uniformity and alignment of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions. It includes subjective analysis and interpretation, which is explicitly forbidden, and omits required objective details.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its failures:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption's accuracy cannot be fully verified without seeing the video. However, it moves beyond objective description into subjective interpretation. Phrases like \"suggesting a sense of uniformity and focus,\" \"emphasize the collective presence,\" and \"highlights the uniformity and alignment\" are analytical claims about the scene's mood and composition, not factual descriptions of the subjects. The instructions require describing only what is visually present, not what it might imply.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete. While it mentions clothing and hairstyles, it fails to include other key visual attributes required by the instructions for describing people, such as skin tone, approximate age, facial hair, or facial expressions.\n*   It identifies a \"long table\" but provides no further details about its color, material, or shape, as instructed for objects.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates several core rules:\n*   **Forbidden Subjective Language:** The primary failure is its heavy reliance on subjective and interpretive language. The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to describe only what is visible. The entire second half of the caption is dedicated to analyzing the scene's effect rather than describing its contents.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", directly violating the rule to \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'\" (or 'video').\n*   **Focus on Background/Composition:** It describes \"dim lighting,\" \"shadows,\" and \"the overall composition.\" The instructions state to \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" Here, these elements are used to support a subjective analysis, which is not their intended purpose.\n*   **Lack of Detail:** The description of the men is generic (\"light-colored shirts,\" \"dark pants,\" \"varied hairstyles\"). The instructions call for specific and descriptive language to help a reader easily identify each subject (or, in this case, the typical appearance within the group).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A group of men is seated in a row at a long rectangular table. They are wearing light-colored shirts and dark pants. The men have different hairstyles, including short hair and bald heads. Their skin tones vary, and they appear to be middle-aged. Some have facial hair, such as beards or mustaches. The table is made of wood and has a dark finish. The men are sitting close together, facing the same direction. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on the table.",
