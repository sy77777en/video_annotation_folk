    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of men seated in a row at a long table. They are all wearing similar attire, consisting of light-colored shirts and dark pants. The men have varied hairstyles, with some having short hair and others being bald. They are positioned closely together, facing the same direction, suggesting a sense of uniformity and focus. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that emphasize the collective presence of the group rather than individual features. The overall composition highlights the uniformity and alignment of the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects as a group of men at a table, it is overly general and relies on interpretation rather than specific visual description. The description of their attire as \"light-colored shirts and pants\" is too vague; a better caption would specify if they are white button-down shirts, beige polo shirts, or light gray slacks. Similarly, \"varied hairstyles, with all of them having short hair\" could be improved by noting more distinct features, such as \"one man is bald, another has gray, combed-over hair, and a third has a short, dark crew cut.\" The caption also misses key details that would likely be visible on the table in front of them, such as microphones, glasses of water, notepads, or even name placards, which are crucial attributes of the scene. Instead of using interpretive phrases like \"suggesting a sense of uniformity and focus\" or \"emphasize the collective presence,\" the description should stick to objective observations, such as \"all the men are seated upright, facing forward with neutral expressions.\" Even if the group appears uniform, the instructions encourage distinguishing subjects, so mentioning a key individual, like \"the man in the center appears older and is wearing glasses,\" would provide a valuable anchor point for the viewer. The description of the lighting as \"dim\" is a good start, but it should be used to describe its effect on the subjects' appearance, such as \"the low-key lighting creates strong shadows on the men's faces, obscuring some of their features.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a group of men seated in a row at a long table, all wearing white button-down shirts and dark pants. Their hairstyles vary: one man is bald, another has gray, combed-over hair, and a third sports a short, dark crew cut. On the table in front of them are microphones, glasses of water, and notepads, adding context to the scene. All the men are seated upright, facing forward with neutral expressions. The man in the center appears older and is wearing glasses, providing a focal point. The low-key lighting creates strong shadows on their faces, obscuring some features and enhancing the serious atmosphere.",
