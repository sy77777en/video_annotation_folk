    "pre_caption": "The video features a silhouetted man standing to the right, facing a white pickup truck equipped with rooftop tents. The man is wearing a hat and appears to be observing the scene. In front of the truck, there is a camping table with various items on it, including a lantern and some containers. The truck is parked on uneven terrain, and the setup suggests a camping scenario. The overall lighting is low, emphasizing the silhouettes and creating a distinct contrast between the subjects and the dimly lit environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas where it fails to fully adhere to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the main subjects: a silhouetted man, a white pickup truck with rooftop tents, and a camping table with a lantern and containers. The description of their attributes (silhouetted, wearing a hat, parked on uneven terrain) is also correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete, capturing the most salient subjects and their key features. It successfully provides a holistic overview of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some significant flaws.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or an introductory title.\n*   **Conciseness:** The language is mostly concise and clear.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"man,\" \"pickup truck,\" and \"camping table\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It correctly describes key visual attributes like the man being \"silhouetted\" and \"wearing a hat,\" and the truck being \"white\" and \"equipped with rooftop tents.\"\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Inference vs. Factual Description:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n    *   The phrase \"appears to be observing the scene\" is an inference about the man's mental state or action. A more compliant description would stick to his physical pose, such as \"The man stands facing the truck.\"\n    *   The phrase \"the setup suggests a camping scenario\" is an interpretation of the scene's context. The presence of the rooftop tents and camping table already implies this, so stating that it \"suggests\" it is redundant and violates the rule against describing what is not directly visible.\n*   **Redundant Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video features...,\" which is unnecessary introductory text. The instructions require the description to start directly with the subjects.\n*   **Analytical Language:** The final sentence, \"The overall lighting is low, emphasizing the silhouettes and creating a distinct contrast between the subjects and the dimly lit environment,\" is more of a cinematic analysis than a simple description. While mentioning the low light is relevant, explaining its *effect* (\"emphasizing,\" \"creating a contrast\") goes beyond describing visual attributes and into the realm of interpretation, which the instructions discourage. The fact that the man is a \"silhouetted man\" already conveys the necessary information about the lighting.\n\n### Summary\nThe caption successfully identifies the subjects and their basic attributes but violates key instructions by including inferences, interpretations, and analytical language. A better caption would be more direct and purely descriptive, focusing only on what is visually present.",
