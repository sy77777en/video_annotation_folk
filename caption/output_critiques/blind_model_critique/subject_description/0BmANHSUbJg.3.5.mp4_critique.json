    "pre_caption": "The video features a large passenger airplane with a distinctive tail design, which has collided with a building. The aircraft is light-colored with a prominent dark emblem on the tail. The building, which appears to be a hangar, is partially collapsed, with debris scattered around the impact site. Smoke is rising from the damaged area, and the structure is illuminated by bright lights, highlighting the extent of the destruction. The scene is set on a wet tarmac, reflecting the lights and adding to the dramatic visual impact.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central event—an airplane collision with a building—it omits what would likely be the most active and salient subjects in such a video: the emergency response. The description of a static scene with rising smoke and bright lights feels incomplete; a video of this nature would almost certainly feature numerous emergency vehicles, such as fire trucks with flashing red and white lights and ambulances, as well as personnel. The caption should include a description of the firefighters, likely clad in heavy yellow or black protective gear, actively using hoses to spray water or foam onto the smoldering wreckage. The source of the \"bright lights\" is also a critical missing detail; they are probably portable floodlights set up by the response team or the headlights and roof-mounted lights of the emergency vehicles themselves, which would be casting moving beams across the scene. Furthermore, the caption uses the subjective phrase \"dramatic visual impact,\" which should be replaced with a more objective description of the visual elements creating that effect, such as the stark contrast between the intense lights and the surrounding darkness, or the shimmering reflections of the flashing lights on the wet tarmac. Finally, a more specific description of the aircraft, such as noting it is a wide-body, four-engine jet, would add valuable detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a dramatic scene where a large, wide-body, four-engine passenger airplane with a distinctive tail design has collided with a building, likely a hangar, which is partially collapsed with debris scattered around the impact site. Smoke rises from the wreckage, while numerous emergency vehicles, including fire trucks with flashing red and white lights and ambulances, are present. Firefighters, clad in heavy yellow or black protective gear, are actively using hoses to spray water or foam onto the smoldering wreckage. The bright lights illuminating the scene are from portable floodlights set up by the response team and the headlights and roof-mounted lights of the emergency vehicles, casting moving beams across the area. The wet tarmac reflects these lights, creating a stark contrast between the intense illumination and the surrounding darkness, enhancing the visual impact of the scene.",
