    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective in a video game, a person in dark clothing lies motionless on the ground in a dark, foggy street at night. To the right, a white sedan is parked near a low wall. The scene is illuminated by a single, tall, glowing streetlight. The view is framed by the dark silhouettes of two-story buildings. Several on-screen user interface elements are visible: a compass at the top of the screen indicates a heading of 111 degrees southeast; an objective in white text reads \"Find Hadir.\" and later updates to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir.\"; a white waypoint marker on the right is labeled \"Search Church\" with a distance of 93 meters; and subtitles at the bottom of the screen display dialogue in red and green text. A white crosshair appears in the center of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but misses key dynamic elements and specific details that are central to the video's content. The description of the \"person in dark clothing\" is too generic; the individual is clearly a fallen soldier wearing a dark tactical vest over fatigues, a helmet, and has an assault rifle lying on the pavement near their outstretched hand. Crucially, the caption fails to describe the player's own movement. The view is not static; the player character slowly pans their gaze from left to right across the body and then takes a few steps backward, which is why the waypoint distance to the \"Search Church\" objective increases from 93 to 95 meters. The caption also disconnects the UI changes from in-game events; the objective updates to \"Search the clocktower for Hadir\" at the exact moment the player's crosshair moves off the body, implying the body is not Hadir and triggering the new objective. Finally, while the streetlight is mentioned, its effect—casting long, distorted shadows that move as the player moves—is a significant visual element that is omitted.",
