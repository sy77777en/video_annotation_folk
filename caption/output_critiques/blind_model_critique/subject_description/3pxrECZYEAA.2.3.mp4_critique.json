    "pre_caption": "The video features a stylized, animated bird with exaggerated features. The bird has a long, curved beak and large, round eyes with prominent pupils, giving it a cartoonish appearance. Its body is primarily red with orange accents, including its wings and tail feathers. The bird is depicted lying on a surface covered in orange, dripping shapes that resemble a liquid or goo, contrasting with the purple ground. The bird's pose changes from upright to lying flat, suggesting a transition from alertness to a more relaxed or subdued state. The overall scene is vibrant and surreal, with bold colors and abstract forms.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It excels in accuracy and descriptive detail but falters slightly by including subjective interpretations, which violates a key instruction.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"stylized, animated bird\" and precisely describes its visual attributes: \"long, curved beak,\" \"large, round eyes,\" \"primarily red with orange accents,\" and its interaction with the \"orange, dripping shapes\" and \"purple ground.\" The description of the pose change is also an accurate summary of the video's action.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It provides a holistic description of the video's content without referring to specific frames. It successfully captures the main subject, its key features, its environment, and the central action (changing from an upright to a lying position), giving a comprehensive overview of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Format and Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text, as instructed.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is clear, and the description is focused and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subject as a \"bird\" and uses descriptive language (\"stylized, animated\") to specify its type.\n*   **Attribute Detail:** It provides excellent detail on the bird's visual attributes (color, shape, features) and its pose.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The main weakness is the use of subjective and interpretive language, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\").\n    *   The phrase \"...suggesting a transition from alertness to a more relaxed or subdued state\" is an interpretation of the bird's internal state or emotion, which is not directly visible. A more compliant description would stick to the observable action, such as: \"The bird's pose changes from an upright position to lying flat.\"\n    *   The final sentence states the scene is \"vibrant and surreal.\" While \"vibrant\" can be a descriptor for color intensity, \"surreal\" is a subjective judgment of the artistic style. The instruction is to describe what is visually present, not to classify the art style with subjective terms. A more objective phrasing would be: \"The scene is composed of bold colors and abstract forms.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption does an excellent job of describing the visual facts of the video but needs revision to remove subjective interpretations and fully align with the instructions.",
