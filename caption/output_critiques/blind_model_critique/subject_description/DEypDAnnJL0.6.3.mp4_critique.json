    "pre_caption": "The video features two women on a video call. The main subject is a woman with curly hair, wearing a yellow shirt with floral designs. She occupies the entire screen and appears to be in a neutral or slightly concerned expression. In the bottom-right corner, a smaller video overlay shows another woman with straight hair and bangs, wearing a gray sweater over a white shirt. Her expression seems attentive or engaged. This overlay covers about 25% of the screen, partially blocking the view of the woman in yellow. The setting suggests a digital communication context.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The frame shows two separate video feeds, each displaying a medium close-up of a woman, suggesting they are on a video call. The woman in yellow occupies the entire screen, while the woman in gray appears in a smaller video overlay in the bottom-right corner, covering about 25% of the screen and partially blocking a small part of the woman in yellow.**",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a good overview, but it misses several key dynamic and specific visual details from the video, making it feel more like a description of a static screenshot. The caption states the main woman has a \"neutral or slightly concerned expression,\" but in the video, she is actively speaking, with her eyebrows slightly furrowed in concentration and her mouth moving. She also gestures with her right hand to emphasize a point, an important action that is completely omitted. The description of the second woman as \"attentive or engaged\" is vague; the video clearly shows her nodding along and offering small, encouraging smiles, which are more specific and observable actions. Furthermore, the description of the main woman's hair as just \"curly\" is incomplete, as her dark brown hair is visibly tied up in a high ponytail. The caption also fails to mention that the woman in the overlay is wearing thin, black-framed glasses, a significant facial attribute. Finally, the phrase \"occupies the entire screen\" is contradicted by the mention of the overlay; it would be more accurate to describe her as the full-screen participant in a video call interface.",
