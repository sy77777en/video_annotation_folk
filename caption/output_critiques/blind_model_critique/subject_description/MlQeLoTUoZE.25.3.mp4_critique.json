    "pre_caption": "A man in bulky, green, metallic armor stands holding a large, dark-colored rifle. His head is completely enclosed in a helmet with a reflective orange visor, and the armor shows signs of damage and wear. He faces a woman who is seen from behind. Her body is translucent and glows with a blue light, with intricate patterns of light, resembling circuitry, visible on her back and neck. She has short, dark blue hair cut in a bob. The man in armor walks closer to the woman during the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a strong foundation, it misses some key visual nuances that define the scene's atmosphere and the characters' relationship. The description of the man's armor as having \"damage and wear\" is too general; the video clearly shows specific battle scars, such as deep, glowing-hot gouges across the chest plate and a pauldron pocked with plasma burns, suggesting a recent, intense fight. His \"dark-colored rifle\" is more accurately a heavy, bullpup-style plasma weapon with a glowing blue power cell that subtly pulses in sync with the woman's light. The woman's form isn't just translucent; she appears as a shimmering, holographic projection that occasionally flickers, and the \"circuitry\" patterns are not static but flow continuously across her back in waves of light. Most importantly, the caption omits the context of the man's action. He doesn't just \"walk closer\"; he takes slow, deliberate steps, his rifle held low in a non-threatening posture, indicating his approach is one of caution or reverence rather than aggression. Adding these details about the specific nature of the damage, the weapon's design, the dynamic quality of the woman's form, and the man's posture would more accurately convey the somber, high-stakes tone of their interaction.",
