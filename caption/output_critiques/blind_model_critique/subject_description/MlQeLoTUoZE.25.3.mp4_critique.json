    "pre_caption": "A man in bulky, green, metallic armor stands holding a large, dark-colored rifle. His head is completely enclosed in a helmet with a reflective orange visor, and the armor shows signs of damage and wear. He faces a woman who is seen from behind. Her body is translucent and glows with a blue light, with intricate patterns of light, resembling circuitry, visible on her back and neck. She has short, dark blue hair cut in a bob. The man in armor walks closer to the woman during the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the provided instructions, here is a detailed feedback on the caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a near-perfect execution of the instructions, providing a description that is accurate, complete, and meticulously follows the specified rules.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   **Man in Armor:** The description of the man is spot-on. The armor is indeed \"bulky, green, metallic,\" and he holds a \"large, dark-colored rifle.\" The \"helmet with a reflective orange visor\" and the \"signs of damage and wear\" are all clearly visible details that the caption correctly identifies.\n*   **Woman:** The description of the woman is also precise. She is seen from behind, her body is \"translucent and glows with a blue light,\" and she has \"intricate patterns of light, resembling circuitry\" on her back and neck. Her \"short, dark blue hair cut in a bob\" is also correctly noted.\n*   **Action:** The caption accurately captures the primary action in the video: \"The man in armor walks closer to the woman during the scene.\"\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information needed to understand the scene.\n*   It identifies the two primary subjects and describes their most salient and unique features in detail.\n*   It establishes the spatial relationship and interaction between them (\"He faces a woman,\" \"walks closer to the woman\").\n*   It does not omit any key visual elements. The level of detail is appropriate, focusing on what makes each subject distinct without getting lost in minor, irrelevant details.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all the given constraints.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is succinct yet packed with specific visual data.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the two subjects, their attributes, and their relationship, avoiding unnecessary descriptions of the dark, non-descript background.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes the entire video into a coherent paragraph, correctly noting the man's movement over time (\"walks closer... during the scene\") without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The language is neutral and descriptive. Adjectives like \"bulky,\" \"metallic,\" and \"translucent\" describe physical properties rather than conveying emotion.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"man,\" \"woman,\" \"armor,\" \"rifle,\" and \"helmet.\" The inference that the armored figure is a \"man\" is a reasonable judgment call as per the instructions.\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between \"the man in... armor\" and \"the woman\" using their defining visual characteristics.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as requested.",
