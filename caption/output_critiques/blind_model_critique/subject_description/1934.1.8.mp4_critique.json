    "pre_caption": "A large, white, camera-like machine with a rectangular body is positioned centrally. It features a large, dark, circular lens recessed in the center, a smaller secondary lens on a cylindrical mount to the top left, and a small, square viewfinder to the top right. To the right of this machine stands a man in a full-body, tight-fitting white suit with three black dots on the chest and matching white gloves. He wears a white skullcap with white goggles pushed up on his forehead, revealing a face with orange makeup, pronounced dark eyebrows, and an open mouth. He is holding a silver-colored crank with both hands, appearing to operate the machine.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong foundation by identifying the two primary subjects and their core visual characteristics. However, it could be improved by providing more specific details about the action and the subjects' interaction. The description of the man \"raising his hand to move the white goggles\" is ambiguous; the video likely shows the complete action of him lowering the goggles and fitting them over his eyes, and the caption should reflect this entire motion for better accuracy. Furthermore, the man's orientation and gaze are missing. It is important to state whether he is looking at the machine, directly at the viewer, or off-screen, as this defines his relationship with the other elements in the scene. The description of his \"open mouth\" could also be more specific—is he speaking, shouting, or is it a neutral expression? While the machine is described well, additional details such as its texture (e.g., matte, glossy, metallic) or any visible glowing indicator lights would enhance the description. Finally, the description of the man's makeup as just \"orange\" is vague; the video might show a specific pattern or design to the makeup that would be a key identifying feature of the character.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large, white, camera-like machine with a rectangular body is positioned centrally, featuring a matte finish. It has a large, dark, circular lens recessed in the center, a smaller secondary lens on a cylindrical mount to the top left, and a small, square viewfinder to the top right. To the right of this machine stands a man in a full-body, tight-fitting white suit with three black dots on the chest and matching white gloves. He wears a white skullcap with white goggles, which he is lowering over his eyes with both hands, revealing a face with intricate orange makeup in a geometric pattern and pronounced dark eyebrows. His mouth is open as if he is speaking. The man is oriented towards the machine, focusing intently on it as he operates a silver-colored crank. The machine has small, glowing indicator lights that add to its futuristic appearance.",
