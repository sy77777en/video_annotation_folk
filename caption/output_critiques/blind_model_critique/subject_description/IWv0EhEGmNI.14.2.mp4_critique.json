    "pre_caption": "The video shows a first-person perspective of an individual holding a black assault rifle with a visible ammunition counter, moving through an indoor environment. The person’s hands, covered by tactical gloves, grip the weapon. A large, framed portrait of a man in a military uniform with a mustache and medals is prominently displayed on a wall. In another area, a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring is visible, and an on-screen objective text instructs to \"Escape through the north-side tunnel.\" No other people or animals are clearly visible, and the focus remains on the weapon, the portrait, and the interior spaces navigated by the armed individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it violates several key instructions, despite being generally accurate and informative. The primary issues are the inclusion of introductory text, describing what is not visible, and adding meta-commentary about the video's focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy\n\n*   **High:** The caption is very accurate in its description of the visible elements. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the type of weapon (\"black assault rifle\"), the \"visible ammunition counter,\" the \"tactical gloves,\" the \"framed portrait of a man in a military uniform,\" and the \"on-screen objective text.\" The details provided for each subject are correct.\n\n#### Completeness\n\n*   **Good:** The caption is largely complete. It successfully identifies and describes all the salient subjects in the video: the armed individual (from a first-person view), the weapon, the portrait, and the on-screen text. It provides enough detail to give a clear understanding of the video's content.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **FAIL: No Introductory Text:**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n    *   **Caption:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\". This is forbidden introductory text. The description should start directly with the subjects.\n\n*   **FAIL: Avoid Describing What Is Not Visible:**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n    *   **Caption:** The caption includes the phrase, \"No other people or animals are clearly visible...\". This is a direct violation of the instruction, as it describes the absence of subjects.\n\n*   **FAIL: Avoid Subjective or Meta-Commentary:**\n    *   **Instruction:** The goal is to provide a clear, concise description of subjects, not an analysis of the video's composition.\n    *   **Caption:** The final clause, \"...and the focus remains on the weapon, the portrait, and the interior spaces navigated by the armed individual,\" is meta-commentary. It describes the director's or editor's choice of focus rather than describing the subjects themselves.\n\n*   **PARTIAL FAIL: Focus on Subjects, Not Background:**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects...\"\n    *   **Caption:** The description of \"a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring\" is a description of the background. While it helps set the scene, it is not a subject itself and isn't strictly necessary to describe the on-screen text. It's a minor violation but deviates from the primary focus on subjects.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Version\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the given instructions:\n\nFrom a first-person perspective, an individual's hands in black tactical gloves hold a black assault rifle that has a visible ammunition counter. A large, framed portrait on a wall depicts a man with a mustache wearing a military uniform with medals. In a corridor with checkered flooring, an on-screen text objective reads, \"Escape through the north-side tunnel.\"",
