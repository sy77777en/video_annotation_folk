    "pre_caption": "The video shows a first-person perspective of an individual holding a black assault rifle with a visible ammunition counter, moving through an indoor environment. The person’s hands, covered by tactical gloves, grip the weapon. A large, framed portrait of a man in a military uniform with a mustache and medals is prominently displayed on a wall. In another area, a dimly lit corridor with checkered flooring is visible, and an on-screen objective text instructs to \"Escape through the north-side tunnel.\" No other people or animals are clearly visible, and the focus remains on the weapon, the portrait, and the interior spaces navigated by the armed individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the core subjects and the first-person shooter perspective, but it misses opportunities to convey the video's specific aesthetic and atmosphere. For instance, the \"black assault rifle\" could be described with more detail to reflect its likely futuristic design, such as mentioning if the \"ammunition counter\" is a glowing red digital display integrated into the weapon's body or if there are other attachments like a holographic sight. The \"tactical gloves\" could be more vividly described as black, fingerless gloves with reinforced carbon-fiber knuckles, which would add to the characterization. While the portrait is well-described, adding details like the uniform's dark green color or the ornate, gilded frame it sits in would better explain why it is so \"prominently displayed.\" The caption also merges two distinct environments; it would be more effective to describe the transition from the wood-paneled, well-lit room containing the portrait to the starkly contrasting, grimy service corridor with the checkered floor, as this shift is a key part of the visual narrative. Finally, specifying that the on-screen objective text appears as a semi-transparent overlay in the corner of the screen would clarify that this is a user interface element from a video game, a crucial piece of context the current description only implies.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video offers a first-person shooter perspective, showcasing an individual wielding a sleek, futuristic black assault rifle. The weapon features a glowing red digital ammunition counter seamlessly integrated into its body, along with a holographic sight attachment. The person's hands are clad in black, fingerless tactical gloves with reinforced carbon-fiber knuckles, gripping the weapon firmly. The scene begins in a wood-paneled, well-lit room where a large, framed portrait of a man in a dark green military uniform, adorned with medals and a mustache, is prominently displayed in an ornate, gilded frame. The environment transitions to a starkly contrasting, dimly lit service corridor with grimy checkered flooring. An on-screen objective text, appearing as a semi-transparent overlay in the corner, instructs the player to \"Escape through the north-side tunnel.\" The focus remains on the weapon, the portrait, and the distinct interior spaces navigated by the armed individual, with no other people or animals clearly visible.",
