    "pre_caption": "This video shows a first-person perspective of a Minecraft gameplay session. The player is building a large, complex structure made of smooth, white blocks high up in the sky. The player's hand, holding a white block, is visible in the bottom-right corner. The player places the block onto the structure and then immediately breaks it, causing it to shatter into a cloud of smaller white particles. The game's user interface is present, with a hotbar at the bottom showing various blocks, including white, glowing blue, diamond, and red types. In the top-left corner, a small avatar of the character Alex, who has orange hair and wears a green shirt, stands on a small platform.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions perfectly.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies:\n*   **The Context:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"first-person perspective of a Minecraft gameplay session.\"\n*   **The Main Action:** It accurately describes the player's action of placing a white block and then immediately breaking it, including the visual effect of it shattering into particles.\n*   **The Subjects:** It correctly identifies all key on-screen subjects: the player's hand, the structure being built, the specific blocks, the user interface (hotbar), and the character avatar (Alex).\n*   **The Details:** The description of the avatar as \"Alex, who has orange hair and wears a green shirt\" is precise. The identification of block types in the hotbar (\"white, glowing blue, diamond, and red\") is also correct and detailed.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete without being verbose.\n*   It captures the most salient action (placing and breaking the block), which is the central event of the video.\n*   It describes all relevant static elements (the UI hotbar, the character avatar in the corner) that provide context.\n*   It provides enough visual detail for each subject (the structure is \"large, complex... made of smooth, white blocks,\" the avatar \"stands on a small platform\") for a viewer to form a clear mental picture.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule in the instructions with precision:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is dense with information but remains easy to read and understand.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the subjects (player's hand, structure, UI) and their attributes, as instructed.\n*   **No Frame/Image References:** It successfully describes the video's content as a continuous whole without using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Proper Use of Background/Motion:** It mentions the structure is \"high up in the sky,\" which is necessary context. It describes the motion of placing and breaking the block because that is the primary action and subject of the video. This is a perfect application of the rule.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective language (\"smooth, white blocks,\" \"shatter into a cloud of smaller white particles\") and avoids subjective emotional adjectives. \"Complex\" is the only borderline term, but in this context, it serves as a factual description of the structure's geometry.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses precise terms like \"player's hand,\" \"structure,\" \"blocks,\" and \"character Alex\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at providing key visual attributes, such as the color and style of Alex's clothing and hair, and the different types of blocks in the hotbar.\n*   **Logical Order:** The description flows logically, starting with the overall context (gameplay), moving to the main action (building), and finishing with the static UI elements.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
