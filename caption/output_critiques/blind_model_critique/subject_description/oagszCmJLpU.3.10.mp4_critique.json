    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot of a powerful weather phenomenon at night. The video lacks a traditional main subject as the focus is entirely on the immense scale and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the storm, which functions as the environment itself. A colossal, rotating supercell cloud with a distinct, layered, saucer-like structure dominates the dark sky. The upper portions of the cloud are brilliantly and intermittently illuminated from within by flashes of purple and white lightning, starkly contrasting with its dark, shadowy underside from which a visible column of rain falls toward the silhouetted horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the supercell as the primary focus and accurately describes its general saucer-like shape and internal lightning, it could be improved by adhering more strictly to the instructions. The description uses subjective, emotional adjectives such as \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" and \"awe-inspiring,\" which should be replaced with objective, dimensional language; for instance, instead of \"colossal,\" state that the cloud formation occupies the entire upper half of the view. The description of motion is also somewhat general; specifying the direction and speed of the cloud's rotation (e.g., \"a slow, counter-clockwise rotation\") and the frequency of the lightning (e.g., \"near-constant flashes\") would provide a more dynamic and precise picture. Furthermore, the \"silhouetted horizon\" is too vague; the video likely shows specific features like a flat plain or the faint outline of a distant treeline, and mentioning this would give a much-needed sense of scale without detracting from the storm. Finally, the term \"column of rain\" might be inaccurate; a \"dense rain shaft\" or a \"wide curtain of precipitation\" would likely be a more fitting description for the precipitation I see falling from such a large storm system.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a landscape dominated by a supercell cloud formation at night, occupying the entire upper half of the view. The cloud exhibits a distinct, layered, saucer-like structure with a slow, counter-clockwise rotation. The upper portions are intermittently illuminated by near-constant flashes of purple and white lightning, contrasting with the dark underside. A wide curtain of precipitation descends from the cloud toward a flat plain, providing a sense of scale against the vast storm system.",
