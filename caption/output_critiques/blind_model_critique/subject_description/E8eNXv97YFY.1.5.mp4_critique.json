    "pre_caption": "The video presents a time-lapse landscape scenery shot of a dramatic sunset over a vast, verdant field. The sky is a canvas of swirling clouds, ranging from dark and brooding to light and ethereal, all set against the warm, golden-yellow light of the sun sinking below the horizon. A still body of water in the foreground acts as a perfect mirror, reflecting the entire celestial display with stunning clarity. As the time-lapse progresses, the ambient light fades, casting the lush landscape and distant trees into dark silhouettes against the colorful sky. The shot intentionally lacks a main subject, instead emphasizing the immersive atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural scene, allowing the viewer to be captivated by the dynamic beauty of the changing light and the cloud-filled sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully identifies the content as a time-lapse landscape and captures the general sequence of events, it deviates significantly from the instructions by using numerous subjective and emotive adjectives. Words like \"dramatic,\" \"brooding,\" \"ethereal,\" \"stunning,\" \"lush,\" and \"captivated\" interpret the scene's mood rather than describing its visual facts, which is explicitly forbidden. A better approach would be to describe the colors and light more objectively, for instance, by detailing the sky's transition from \"golden-yellow to deep orange and purple.\" The description of the water's reflection as having \"stunning clarity\" could be replaced with a more neutral observation, such as \"the water provides a clear, mirror-like reflection of the sky.\" Additionally, the description lacks some specificity that would likely be visible; for example, \"a vast, verdant field\" could be improved by noting the texture, such as \"a field of tall, green grass,\" and \"distant trees\" could be more precisely described as \"a line of pointed fir trees.\" The final sentence explaining the lack of a main subject is appropriate but could be more concise and objective, avoiding phrases like \"dynamic beauty.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a time-lapse landscape shot of a sunset over a field of tall, green grass. The sky transitions from golden-yellow to deep orange and purple, with swirling clouds of varying shades. A still body of water in the foreground provides a clear, mirror-like reflection of the sky. As the time-lapse progresses, the ambient light fades, casting the landscape and a line of pointed fir trees into silhouettes against the colorful sky. The shot emphasizes the atmosphere and scale of the natural scene, allowing the viewer to observe the changing light and cloud-filled sky.",
