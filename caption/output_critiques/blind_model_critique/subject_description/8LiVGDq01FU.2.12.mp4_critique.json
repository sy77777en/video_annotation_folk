    "pre_caption": "The video features a person wearing a space suit, characterized by a helmet and a dark, padded jacket with light-colored stripes. The suit includes gloves and pants that match the jacket's color scheme. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with arms extended, suggesting movement or interaction with something out of view. The setting appears to be a dimly lit, enclosed space with reflective surfaces, enhancing the futuristic and technical appearance of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially good** but fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it accurately describes the main subject, it includes forbidden elements like speculation, background details, and subjective language.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description of the subject is accurate. It correctly identifies a \"person wearing a space suit\" and provides precise visual details such as the \"helmet,\" \"dark, padded jacket with light-colored stripes,\" and matching \"gloves and pants.\" The description of the person's pose and orientation—\"back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with arms extended\"—is also correct and specific.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete description of the primary subject's key visual attributes. It successfully captures the most important details of the person's attire and posture, fulfilling the requirement to focus on the subject.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\":** The caption speculates on the person's actions by stating their pose is \"...suggesting movement or interaction with something out of view.\" This is an interpretation of intent and involves something explicitly \"out of view,\" which is forbidden.\n2.  **Violation of \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary\":** The final sentence, \"The setting appears to be a dimly lit, enclosed space with reflective surfaces...\" is a detailed description of the background. This information is not necessary to identify or distinguish the main subject, and therefore should have been omitted.\n3.  **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The caption uses subjective terms to describe the scene's \"futuristic and technical appearance.\" These are interpretive judgments, not objective visual facts, and are contrary to the instruction to avoid such language.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption succeeds in its primary goal of describing the subject's appearance and pose accurately and in detail. However, it is not a good caption because it fails to follow critical negative constraints. To be compliant, it should have omitted the speculative phrase about the person's actions, the entire sentence describing the background, and the subjective adjectives.",
