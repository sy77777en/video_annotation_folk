    "pre_caption": "The video initially focuses on a wine cabinet in the background, filled with various bottles arranged on shelves. As the focus shifts to the foreground, it reveals half of a wine glass containing light blue wine on the left side. Next to the glass, there is a white-grey colored food item, likely cheese, placed in the middle. The scene transitions from the detailed view of the wine cabinet to highlighting the wine glass and cheese, emphasizing the change in focus from background to foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with the wine cabinet in focus in the background. A rack focus then shifts the attention to the foreground, revealing half of a wine glass with light blue wine on the left and a white-grey colored food item, possibly cheese, in the middle.**",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subjects: a wine cabinet with bottles, a wine glass with light blue liquid, and a food item. It also accurately describes the primary action of the video, which is a rack focus shifting from the background cabinet to the foreground glass and food.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is mostly complete, capturing the essential narrative of the video. It describes the initial state, the transition, and the final state. It could be slightly more complete by adding more visual attributes, such as the material of the wine cabinet (e.g., dark wood) or the texture of the food item, but it successfully prioritizes the most salient details for a concise description.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption provides a clear and easy-to-understand summary of the video's content in a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** It correctly identifies subject types (\"wine cabinet,\" \"bottles,\" \"wine glass,\" \"food item\") and describes their key visual attributes (color, contents, placement).\n    *   **Holistic Description:** It successfully describes the video as a whole by detailing the focus shift, rather than describing static frames.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses objective, simple English.\n    *   **Handling Transitions:** The description of the focus shift (\"As the focus shifts...\", \"The scene transitions from...\") is a perfect execution of the instruction to describe how subjects change or are revealed.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Speculation:** The phrase \"**likely cheese**\" violates the rule: \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" A better approach would be to describe only its visible properties, such as \"a white-grey, crumbly food item.\"\n    *   **Redundancy:** The final sentence (\"The scene transitions from the detailed view of the wine cabinet to highlighting the wine glass and cheese, emphasizing the change in focus from background to foreground\") is redundant. It repeats the information already conveyed in the second sentence (\"As the focus shifts to the foreground, it reveals...\"). Removing this last sentence would make the caption more concise without losing any critical information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good** but not perfect. It demonstrates a strong understanding of most instructions, particularly in structuring the narrative around the video's primary action (the focus pull). Its main weaknesses are a minor instance of speculation and a final sentence that adds redundancy, slightly undermining the goal of maximum conciseness.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a focus on a dark wood wine cabinet in the background, filled with various bottles arranged on shelves. As the focus shifts to the foreground, it reveals half of a wine glass containing light blue wine on the left side. Next to the glass, there is a white-grey, crumbly food item placed in the middle. The scene transitions smoothly, emphasizing the change in focus from the background to the foreground.",
