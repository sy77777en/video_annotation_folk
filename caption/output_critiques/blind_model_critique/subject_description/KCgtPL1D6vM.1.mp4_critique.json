    "pre_caption": "This video captures a cityscape scenery shot of a bustling, narrow street in a historic European city. The view looks up a sloping road, defined by tram tracks and flanked on both sides by tall, traditional buildings with storefronts on the ground floor and balconies above. A vintage red tram is visible in the middle distance, while a white and yellow tram, decorated with small monkey illustrations and the number 574, moves across the foreground. Pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks, and a person on a scooter drives up the street. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, static perspective is focused on capturing the overall environment and atmosphere of the location. The various elements—the iconic trams, the distinct architecture, and the flow of people—work together to create a comprehensive portrait of daily life on this specific street.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main elements, it overlooks several key visual details that define the scene's character. The description of the foreground tram is missing its direction of travel; it moves from left to right, and the \"monkey illustrations\" are not small but part of a full, colorful vinyl wrap advertisement that covers most of the tram's lower half. The \"pedestrians\" are described too generically; for instance, a prominent figure is a man on the left sidewalk, wearing a blue jacket and carrying a tripod, who appears to be a photographer setting up a shot. The \"traditional buildings\" could be more vividly described by mentioning their pastel-colored facades in shades of pink and ochre, adorned with characteristic decorative tilework and black wrought-iron railings on the balconies, from which a few potted plants are visible. Furthermore, the \"person on a scooter\" is specifically a food delivery driver on an electric scooter, identifiable by the large, square, orange thermal bag on their back. Lastly, while the shot is wide, calling the foreground tram anything other than the primary subject is slightly misleading, as its movement and detailed branding make it the undeniable focal point of the action, contrasting with the more static red tram in the background.",
