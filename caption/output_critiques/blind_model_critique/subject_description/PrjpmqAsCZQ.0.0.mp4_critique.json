    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with a medium build, wearing a long-sleeved shirt and headphones. He is seated at a desk with electronic equipment, including a keyboard and various controls. The scene is illuminated by a greenish light, suggesting a night vision effect. The man is engaged in manipulating the equipment, with a focus on his hands interacting with a glowing object, possibly a small device or control. His posture is slightly leaned forward, indicating concentration on the task at hand.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video has a **main subject with dynamic size**, so the description should focus on them. Don't mention the background scene and other motion.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few key areas where it fails to follow the instructions perfectly.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies a man at a desk with electronic equipment, wearing a shirt and headphones. The description of his posture and actions (leaning forward, manipulating equipment) is also accurate.\n*   **Inaccurate Speculation:** The caption violates the rule \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n    *   \"...**suggesting** a night vision effect.\" This is an interpretation of the green light, not a direct description of it. It should simply state that the scene is illuminated by a green light.\n    *   \"...**possibly** a small device or control.\" The word \"possibly\" explicitly states uncertainty, which is forbidden. The caption should describe the object's visible attributes (e.g., \"a small, glowing, rectangular object\") without guessing its function.\n    *   \"...**indicating concentration** on the task at hand.\" This is a subjective interpretation of the man's mental state based on his posture. The instruction is to describe the posture itself (\"leaned forward\") but to avoid subjective conclusions about emotion or focus.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Good Subject Identification:** The caption correctly identifies the main subject as a \"man\" and notes key objects like the \"desk,\" \"keyboard,\" and \"headphones.\"\n*   **Lacks Specificity:** The description of the objects is too general. The instruction asks for specific details like color, shape, and material.\n    *   \"electronic equipment\" and \"various controls\" are vague. If specific items like monitors, a mixing board, or a joystick are visible, they should be named.\n    *   The description of the man is missing key visual attributes requested by the instructions, such as skin tone, hairstyle, or the specific color and style of the long-sleeved shirt, assuming they are visible.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly avoids using the words \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It focuses on the primary subject and describes his actions as required.\n    *   The language is simple and natural.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Primary Violation:** The most significant failure is the inclusion of speculation and subjective interpretation (\"suggesting,\" \"possibly,\" \"indicating concentration\"), which directly contradicts the core instructions.\n    *   **Lack of Detail:** The caption does not provide the level of detail for visual attributes (for both the person and objects) that the instructions demand.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a man with a medium build, wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt and black headphones. He is seated at a desk with electronic equipment, including a black keyboard and several visible controls, such as a monitor and a mixing board. The scene is illuminated by a green light. The man is engaged in manipulating the equipment, with a focus on his hands interacting with a small, glowing, rectangular object. His posture is slightly leaned forward.
