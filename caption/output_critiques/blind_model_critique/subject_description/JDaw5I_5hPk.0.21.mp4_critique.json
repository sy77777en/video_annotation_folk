    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. The caption is very good, but it has one specific flaw regarding the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is **good** and largely successful. It accurately captures the essence of the video, correctly identifies it as a scenery shot, and follows most of the complex instructions. However, it fails on one key negative constraint.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a \"shallow, rocky creek flowing through a... green forest.\" The details about the perspective (\"from above, looking down\"), the composition (\"out-of-focus foliage in the foreground creating a natural frame\"), and the water (\"dark, rippling\") are all precise and true to the visual information.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. For a scenery shot without a main subject, it provides a comprehensive overview of the environment, which is exactly what the instructions require. It successfully explains *why* there is no main subject by noting the focus is on the overall environment and composition.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** It perfectly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots. It identifies the video as a \"nature scenery shot,\" explicitly states \"There is no main subject,\" and explains that the focus is on the environment and atmosphere.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is concise, clear, and written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific moments or frames.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"video.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses specific and descriptive language for the visual elements (e.g., \"shallow, rocky creek,\" \"out-of-focus foliage,\" \"dark, rippling water\").\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** This is the main flaw. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption violates this rule by using:\n    *   **\"lush\"**: This is borderline, but generally acceptable as it describes a visual quality of dense growth.\n    *   **\"tranquil\" and \"secluded\"**: These are clear violations. They describe an atmosphere and a feeling, which are subjective interpretations rather than objective visual facts.\n    *   **\"hidden\"**: This is also an interpretation. While the framing might suggest a hidden space, the word itself describes a state that isn't directly visible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very well-written and demonstrates a strong understanding of almost all the instructions. Its only significant error is the inclusion of subjective, emotional, and interpretive adjectives (\"tranquil,\" \"secluded,\" \"hidden\"), which is explicitly forbidden. To be perfect, it should have described the scene using only objective visual details, allowing the reader to infer the atmosphere for themselves.",
