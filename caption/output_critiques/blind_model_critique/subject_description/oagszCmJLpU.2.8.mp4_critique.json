    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful supercell thunderstorm moving across a vast, flat plain. The sky is filled with a massive, swirling formation of dark grey and white storm clouds, with a lower, menacing shelf cloud from which curtains of heavy rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a wide expanse of green and yellow grassland stretches uninterrupted to the horizon, emphasizing the immense scale of the weather system. There is no main subject because the composition's focus is on capturing the raw power and atmospheric drama of the storm itself, dwarfing the landscape below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the content as a landscape scenery shot and accurately describes the general elements, it relies heavily on subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" and \"menacing,\" which the instructions advise against. Instead of stating the storm is \"powerful,\" the description could be improved by providing more specific, objective details about its structure that imply its power, such as mentioning a \"distinctly rotating updraft\" or a \"large, flattened anvil top characteristic of a supercell.\" The description of the clouds as a \"swirling formation\" is good, but it could be more precise by detailing the contrast in lighting, such as \"brightly lit upper sections against a dark, shadowed base.\" Furthermore, the caption misses an opportunity to enhance the sense of scale by omitting small, grounding elements that might be present, such as a lone dirt road winding through the grassland or a distant, tiny farmhouse, which would serve to emphasize the storm's size without becoming main subjects. Finally, the introductory phrase \"This is a...\" should be removed, and the concluding explanation for the lack of a main subject could be more concisely integrated into the main description rather than being a separate, explanatory clause.",
