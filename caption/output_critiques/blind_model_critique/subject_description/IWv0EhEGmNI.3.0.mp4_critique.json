    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective through a green-tinted night-vision display, a person wearing white gloves holds a dark-colored firearm. The weapon is equipped with a large, boxy holographic sight on its top rail. A digital heads-up display is superimposed on the view, indicating an ammunition count of 13 in the magazine and 90 in reserve. The person is positioned near a large, cylindrical hay bale in a dark, outdoor setting. In the background, additional hay bales and the silhouettes of several pine trees are visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key subjects: a person, a firearm, a holographic sight, a digital heads-up display (HUD), hay bales, and pine trees. The descriptions of these subjects, such as the \"white gloves,\" \"dark-colored firearm,\" \"large, boxy holographic sight,\" and the specific ammunition count on the HUD, are precise and factually correct based on the visual information.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It captures the most important elements of the scene, starting with the main subject in the first-person view (the person and their weapon) and extending to the secondary environmental details. It successfully conveys the context of the scene (a night-time, outdoor setting) without getting lost in minor details.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions exceptionally well:\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that packs a lot of specific information without being wordy.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on describing the subjects and their visual attributes.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types like \"person\" and \"firearm.\"\n    *   **Objective Language:** The description uses descriptive but non-subjective adjectives (e.g., \"green-tinted,\" \"cylindrical,\" \"boxy\") and avoids emotional or speculative language.\n    *   **No Speculation:** It correctly identifies the subject as a \"person,\" as other details like gender or age are not discernible, and only describes what is clearly visible.\n    *   **Logical Structure:** It correctly prioritizes the subjects, starting with the most prominent foreground elements (the first-person view, weapon, and HUD) before moving to the background, which is a logical and effective way to structure the description.",
