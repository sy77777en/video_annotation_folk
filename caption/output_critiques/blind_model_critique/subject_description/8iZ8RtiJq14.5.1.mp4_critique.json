    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot reveals several items pinned to a brown corkboard. The initial focus is on a light blue, square sticky note with the word \"BUTCHER\" handwritten in black capital letters. Next to it is a tilted, rectangular, silver game piece for \"PARK PLACE,\" which has a code \"676XDHQ1P6\" printed on it. A red and white twisted string is attached to a red, round-headed pushpin that holds the game piece. The view then follows the red string and pushpin down to another light blue sticky note. This second note, now in focus, has the words \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND\" handwritten on it in black capital letters. A portion of a yellow sticky note with \"$10k\" written on it is also visible in the lower-left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the subjects (corkboard, sticky notes, game piece, pushpin, string) and precisely describes their visual attributes. Details like the color of the notes (\"light blue,\" \"yellow\"), the text on them (\"BUTCHER,\" \"BUTCHER'S FRIEND,\" \"$10k\"), the specific game piece (\"PARK PLACE\"), the code on it (\"676XDHQ1P6\"), and the appearance of the string (\"red and white twisted\") are all captured correctly.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It doesn't miss any salient details. It starts with the broader context (corkboard), moves to the initial point of focus (the first note and game piece), describes the connecting elements (string and pushpin), and follows the visual path to the second point of focus (the second note). It even includes the partially visible yellow sticky note, demonstrating thorough observation.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule in the instructions flawlessly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of detail into a single, coherent paragraph without being wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is entirely focused on the subjects and their attributes. The background (corkboard) is mentioned only to provide necessary context.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" \"first frame,\" etc. Instead, it uses natural language like \"The initial focus is on...\" and \"The view then follows...\" to describe the video's progression.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"light blue,\" \"square,\" \"tilted\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for each object, including color, shape, material (\"silver game piece\"), text, and orientation (\"tilted, rectangular... game piece\").\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It clearly distinguishes between the multiple sticky notes by describing their content and order of appearance.\n*   **Logical Flow:** The caption describes the subjects in the logical order that the video presents them, effectively narrating the camera's movement and shift in focus.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, well-written paragraph with no markdown or introductory text, as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and structured perfectly to create a clear mental picture of the video's content and flow.",
