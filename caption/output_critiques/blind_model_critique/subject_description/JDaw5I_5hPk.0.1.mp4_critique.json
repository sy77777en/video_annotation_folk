    "pre_caption": "This video presents a natural scenery shot of the open sea. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the vast, textured surface of the water, emphasizing the environment and atmosphere. The deep blue water is covered in a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves that gently rise and fall. A soft, purplish-pink light, likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame, reflects off the crests of the waves, creating a subtle contrast with the darker troughs and lending a serene quality to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good, but with a few minor areas for improvement.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as the open sea and precisely describes its visual characteristics: the \"deep blue water,\" the \"small, choppy waves,\" and the \"soft, purplish-pink light\" reflecting on the surface. The description of the light creating contrast between the wave crests and troughs is also a precise and accurate observation.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It correctly follows the specific instructions for a scenery shot by stating that there is no main subject and explaining that the focus is on the environment and atmosphere. It successfully captures all the essential visual information—the water's state, color, and the quality of the light—without needing to invent or add superfluous details.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to the vast majority of the instructions very well, but there are a few minor points where it deviates slightly.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly follows the rule for scenery shots by identifying the type (\"natural scenery shot of the open sea\") and explaining the absence of a main subject in a single, clear sentence.\n*   **Format and Conciseness:** It is a single, coherent paragraph, avoids Markdown, and does not use forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses specific and descriptive language (e.g., \"deep blue,\" \"choppy waves,\" \"purplish-pink light\") to describe visual attributes.\n*   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific moments or frames.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the phrase \"lending a serene quality to the scene.\" The word \"serene\" describes a feeling or atmosphere, which is subjective. A more objective description would focus purely on the visual elements, such as the slow movement of the waves or the softness of the light.\n*   **Making Inferences:** The instruction is to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption includes the phrase \"likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame.\" While qualifying the statement with \"likely\" shows an awareness of the uncertainty, a stricter adherence to the rule would be to describe only the visible light itself (\"A soft, purplish-pink light illuminates the scene...\") without speculating on its source.\n*   **Introductory Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"This video presents...\" which is slightly meta-descriptive. A more direct and immersive opening, such as \"A natural scenery shot captures the open sea,\" would align better with the goal of providing a pure description of the content.\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. The suggested improvements are minor refinements to achieve perfect adherence to the provided rules.",
