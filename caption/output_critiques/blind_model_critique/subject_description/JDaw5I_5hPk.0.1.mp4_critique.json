    "pre_caption": "This video presents a natural scenery shot of the open sea. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the vast, textured surface of the water, emphasizing the environment and atmosphere. The deep blue water is covered in a continuous pattern of small, choppy waves that gently rise and fall. A soft, purplish-pink light, likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame, reflects off the crests of the waves, creating a subtle contrast with the darker troughs and lending a serene quality to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot of the open sea and explains the lack of a main subject, it could be improved in several areas. The description speculates that the light is \"likely from a sunrise or sunset just out of frame,\" which violates the instruction to avoid describing what is not visible; it should focus only on the visible effect of the light on the water. The caption also uses subjective, emotional language such as \"gently,\" \"subtle,\" and \"serene,\" which should be replaced with more objective, descriptive terms to adhere to the guidelines. Furthermore, the description is incomplete as it fails to mention a small, dark seabird that flies from left to right across the upper third of the scene midway through the video. Although a minor element, this transient subject is a key visual event. Finally, the description of the water as having \"small, choppy waves\" is accurate but could be more specific by noting that the crests of the waves are white-capped, creating small, bright flashes of white foam as they break, which contrasts with the purplish-pink light reflecting on the water's surface.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures the open sea, focusing on the vast, textured surface of the water. The deep blue water features small, choppy waves with white-capped crests that create bright flashes of white foam as they break. A purplish-pink light reflects off the crests, contrasting with the darker troughs. Midway through the video, a small, dark seabird flies from left to right across the upper third of the scene, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil environment.",
