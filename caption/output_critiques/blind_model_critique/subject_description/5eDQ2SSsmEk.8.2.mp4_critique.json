    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a man's face, focusing on his mouth and beard. The man has a thick, wet beard with visible droplets of water, suggesting dampness or rain. His lips are slightly parted, and the texture of his facial hair is emphasized by the lighting. In another part of the video, a hand, possibly the man's own, is seen interacting with the beard, pulling or adjusting it, which highlights the strands and wetness. The lighting casts a dramatic effect, with a mix of red and blue tones, creating a striking visual contrast.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw regarding adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate. It provides a specific and believable description of a close-up shot, focusing on a man's wet beard, the presence of a hand, and distinct red and blue lighting. The details, such as \"visible droplets of water\" and \"lips are slightly parted,\" create a clear and precise mental image that aligns with a plausible video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the primary subject (the man's face/beard) and a secondary subject (the hand). It describes key visual attributes (wetness, texture, parted lips), the interaction between subjects (hand pulling the beard), and the overall visual style (lighting). It effectively summarizes different parts of the video (\"In another part of the video...\") into a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but fails on one key point.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the subjects (man, hand) and their visual attributes, avoiding unnecessary background details.\n*   **Clear Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"man,\" \"hand\") and clearly describes their relationship and actions.\n*   **Temporal Change:** It effectively describes a change over time (\"In another part of the video...\") without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Handles Uncertainty:** It correctly uses \"possibly the man's own\" to avoid making an unverified assumption, which follows the instruction to not describe what you are unsure about.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The main violation is the use of subjective, evaluative language. The instruction states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The phrases \"**dramatic effect**\" and \"**striking visual contrast**\" are subjective judgments about the quality and impact of the lighting. A more objective and compliant description would state the facts of the lighting without interpreting its effect.\n\n**How to fix the flaw:**\nTo be fully compliant, the last sentence should be rephrased to be purely descriptive.\n\n*   **Original:** \"The lighting casts a dramatic effect, with a mix of red and blue tones, creating a striking visual contrast.\"\n*   **Corrected Version:** \"The scene is lit with a mix of red and blue tones, which creates high contrast on the subject.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent in its structure, detail, and clarity, but its use of \"dramatic\" and \"striking\" violates a key negative constraint in the instructions.",
