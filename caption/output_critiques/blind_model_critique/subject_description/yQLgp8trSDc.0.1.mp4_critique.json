    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with a medium build and a mustache, who appears to be the main subject. He has a focused expression and is wearing a dark blue traditional outfit. His hair is neatly combed back. In the background, there are two other men, one in a light gray robe and the other in a yellow robe with black trim. These secondary subjects are less prominent and appear to be observing the main subject, adding context to the scene. The main subject's posture and attire suggest a setting of significance or formality.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully identifies the main subject and the secondary figures, it lacks specificity and includes speculative language that should be avoided. The description of the main subject's \"dark outfit\" is too vague; it could be improved by specifying that he is wearing a high-collared, long-sleeved tunic made of a heavy, charcoal-gray fabric with subtle silver embroidery on the cuffs. Similarly, his \"long black hair\" is not just \"combed back\" but is actually tied neatly in a low ponytail. A significant detail is omitted entirely: a sheathed sword with an ornate hilt is visible at his left hip, which is crucial for characterizing the subject. The caption uses subjective phrases like \"appears to be,\" \"might be perceived as,\" and \"suggest a setting of significance,\" which violate the instruction to describe only what is visible. Instead of interpreting the scene's formality, the description should stick to concrete details. Finally, the secondary subjects are described as \"observing,\" but a more precise description would note their static, solemn postures, with their hands clasped in front of them, which provides a clearer picture of the scene's atmosphere without resorting to subjective interpretation.",
