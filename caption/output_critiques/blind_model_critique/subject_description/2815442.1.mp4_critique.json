Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is partially good as it follows several key instructions, but it fails on one critical point.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### What the Caption Does Well:\n\n*   **Correctly Identifies Shot Type:** The caption accurately follows the instruction for scenery shots by starting with \"The video is a landscape scenery shot.\"\n*   **Explains Lack of Main Subject:** It correctly explains *why* there is no main subject, adhering to the rule: \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot... Briefly explain why there is no main subject.\" The caption does this by stating, \"The emphasis is on the expansive environment\" and \"The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall...\"\n*   **Format and Structure:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple English, and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" as instructed.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole (\"vast... body of water surrounded by... greenery and distant hills\") without referring to specific moments in time.\n\n### What the Caption Does Poorly:\n\n*   **Major Violation - Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The most significant failure is the repeated use of subjective and emotional adjectives, which the instructions explicitly forbid: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\"\n    *   The caption uses words like \"**serene**,\" \"**lush**,\" \"**tranquil**,\" \"**natural beauty**,\" \"**harmony**,\" and \"**peacefulness**.\"\n    *   These words describe feelings and interpretations rather than objective visual facts. For example, instead of \"serene body of water,\" a more objective description would be \"a still body of water.\" Instead of \"natural beauty,\" it should simply describe the visual elements present.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the video type and follows the structural guidelines for describing a scenery shot. However, its heavy reliance on subjective and emotional language is a direct and repeated violation of a core instruction. To be considered a good caption according to the rules, all subjective terms must be removed and replaced with objective, visual descriptions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is a landscape scenery shot, focusing on a vast, still body of water surrounded by dense greenery and distant hills. The emphasis is on the expansive environment, capturing the calm atmosphere and visual elements of the area. The wide view showcases the scale of the landscape, with the water reflecting the sky and the greenery providing a rich contrast. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall balance and quietness of the scene.",
