    "pre_caption": "This video features a cityscape scenery shot of a grand, octagonal plaza at night, with the camera slowly zooming in. A very tall, ornate column, illuminated in a striking greenish-blue light and topped with a statue, stands as the central monument, surrounded by elegant, uniformly designed classical buildings whose windows glow with warm light. Ornate street lamps are scattered throughout the square, their bright lights creating a prominent starburst effect against the dark sky. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the majestic atmosphere and architectural grandeur of the entire environment, using the column as a centerpiece to showcase the scale and beauty of the location as a whole.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a cityscape of a plaza at night and notes the central column and surrounding architecture, it misses several key visual elements and violates some core instructions. The description omits the dynamic human and vehicular activity present; for instance, it fails to mention the few scattered pedestrians walking across the plaza or the continuous flow of cars, whose headlights and taillights create long, vibrant streaks of red and white light around the octagonal perimeter. The caption also neglects to describe the surface of the plaza itself, which appears to be made of dark, wet cobblestones that create shimmering, distorted reflections of the greenish-blue column and the golden light from the street lamps. Furthermore, the description uses subjective adjectives like \"grand,\" \"elegant,\" and \"majestic,\" which the instructions explicitly forbid. A more effective caption would replace these with objective details, such as describing the buildings as \"multi-story neoclassical structures with illuminated arched windows on each floor.\" Finally, while it mentions the camera's slow zoom, it doesn't describe what this motion reveals, such as the intricate relief carvings depicting historical scenes that become visible on the column's base or the specific form of the statue at its apex, which appears to be a winged figure holding a laurel wreath.",
