    "pre_caption": "The video features an interior scenery shot of a minimalist, tiled room with water. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, highlighting the serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance created by the lighting and reflections on the water. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene by providing context and mood, or as an FPV shot, creating an immersive experience by drawing the viewer into the tranquil setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Good:** The caption accurately identifies the scene as an \"interior scenery shot\" of a \"minimalist, tiled room with water.\" This correctly categorizes the video type and its primary visual elements, aligning with the special instruction for scenery shots.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Partial Adherence:** The caption correctly follows the instruction for scenery shots by explaining *why* there is no main subject: \"The focus is on the environment and atmosphere... the emphasis is on the architectural space and its interaction with light and water.\" This part is well-executed.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates several explicit negative constraints, which are the primary reasons for its failure.\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses the words \"**serene**\" and \"**mysterious**\" to describe the ambiance. These are subjective interpretations of mood and emotion, not objective visual descriptions.\n*   **Violation 2: Speculation and Interpretation:** The instruction states, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" The final sentence is entirely speculative: \"This type of shot **could serve as** an establishing shot... or as an FPV shot...\" This analyzes the potential cinematic *purpose* of the shot, which is an interpretation, not a description of the visible content.\n*   **Violation 3: Use of Introductory Text:** The instruction states, \"**Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.**\" The caption begins with \"The video features...,\" which is a form of introductory text. The description should start directly.\n*   **Violation 4: Lack of Conciseness:** The instruction asks for a \"concise\" description. The third sentence (\"There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the architectural space...\") is redundant, as the second sentence already established this. The entire fourth sentence is speculative and should be removed. The caption could be much shorter and more direct.\n\n### Corrected Example\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the given instructions for this type of video:\n\nThis is an interior scenery shot of a minimalist, tiled room partially filled with still water. There are no salient subjects, as the focus is on the architectural space, the grid-like pattern of the tiles, and the reflections of light on the water's surface.",
