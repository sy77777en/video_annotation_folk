    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a woman in a maroon vest and white shirt, wearing glasses, seated at a table. She is holding an ice cream cone and appears to be enjoying it. Next to her is another woman with blonde hair, wearing a denim jacket, who is looking at her with a slight smile. The scene transitions to a man in a yellow shirt sitting at a different table, which is set with various dishes. He is facing the camera and smiling. The setting is a restaurant with ornate decor, featuring intricate patterns and a circular opening in the background. The transition between subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the women to the man, highlighting the change in interaction and setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas where it fails to adhere strictly to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (two women, one man), their primary clothing (maroon vest, denim jacket, yellow shirt), their actions (one woman holding an ice cream cone, the man sitting at a table with dishes), and the sequence of events, including the transition between the two scenes.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is reasonably complete but could be more detailed.\n\n*   **Strengths:** It provides key details like clothing color, the presence of glasses, and the objects the subjects are interacting with (ice cream cone, dishes).\n*   **Weaknesses:** It misses some visual attributes mentioned in the instructions. For example, it doesn't describe the first woman's hair color/style or the skin tone of any of the subjects. The description of the food in front of the man is vague (\"various dishes\").\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It uses precise subject types (\"woman,\" \"man\").\n    *   It describes the subjects in the order they appear and correctly identifies the transition between scenes.\n\n*   **Where it deviates from the instructions:**\n    1.  **Describing Subjective Emotions:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The phrase \"appears to be enjoying it\" is a subjective interpretation of the woman's internal state, not a direct visual observation. A more compliant description would be \"bringing the ice cream cone to her mouth.\" Similarly, while \"smile\" is a physical description, pairing it with \"slight\" and describing the man as \"smiling\" can lean toward interpreting emotion.\n    2.  **Including Unnecessary Background Details:** The instruction says, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The description of the setting as \"a restaurant with ornate decor, featuring intricate patterns and a circular opening in the background\" is a clear violation of this rule, as these details are not necessary to identify or distinguish the main subjects.\n    3.  **Redundant and Analytical Language:** The final sentence, \"The transition between subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the women to the man, highlighting the change in interaction and setting,\" is partly redundant, as the transition was already described. The phrase \"highlighting the change in interaction and setting\" is analytical rather than descriptive, explaining the *effect* of the transition instead of just describing the visual change.",
