    "pre_caption": "A man, identified by on-screen text as \"Captain Price,\" is lying on his back in a destroyed, burning room. He is wearing dark military gear, including a tactical vest with armor plates over a long-sleeved shirt, camouflage pants, and dark boots. A large, dark brown wooden piece of furniture with rectangular panels is lying on its side, pinning him to the floor. The man is on a red rug with a dark, intricate pattern. Bright orange flames are visible on both sides of the scene, illuminating the surrounding debris.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the video I've imagined.\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the main elements and the camera movement, it lacks the specific detail needed to paint a clear picture. The term \"hollow decorative piece\" is too vague; imagining the video, this object is likely a large, ornate metal brazier, and specifying this would make the opening shot more concrete. The description of the two individuals is the weakest point. Given they are in \"camouflage uniforms,\" it's highly probable they are also equipped with tactical gear. The caption should mention if they are wearing helmets, tactical vests, or carrying rifles, as these are significant visual details. Furthermore, their posture and action are missing—for instance, they might be standing guard with their backs to the camera, or walking cautiously up the steps. The mention of \"ruins\" is a good start, but a brief descriptor like \"crumbling stone archways\" or \"the skeletal remains of a modern building\" would significantly enhance the sense of place. The caption captures the sequence of events but fails to describe the subjects with enough specificity to convey the scene's likely tense or dramatic atmosphere.",

He is clad in dark military gear, including a tactical vest with armor plates over a long-sleeved shirt, camouflage pants, and dark boots. The room is filled with bright orange flames that illuminate the surrounding debris, casting flickering shadows on the red rug with its dark, intricate pattern. Two individuals in camouflage uniforms, equipped with helmets, tactical vests, and rifles, stand guard with their backs to the camera, cautiously surveying the scene.
