    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a scene along a path covered with yellow leaves. Initially, the focus is on the leaves and a hedge with small yellow flowers. As the scene unfolds, a woman is shown sitting on the ground, leaning against the hedge. She has medium-length dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket and black pants with white stripes. Nearby, a man is crouching, facing her. He has short hair and is wearing a white shirt and dark pants. He appears to be holding a yellow umbrella, which is partially open. The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence, with a red car visible in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good. It effectively and accurately describes the video's content while adhering closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is successful:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately identifies the primary subjects (a woman and a man), their key visual attributes (clothing, hair, pose), and their spatial relationship (crouching, facing her). It also correctly includes important objects (yellow umbrella) and background elements (path with leaves, hedge, fence, red car) that provide essential context. The description of the scene unfolding from a focus on the leaves to the reveal of the people is a precise representation of a common cinematic technique.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive. It doesn't just list the subjects but describes their state and actions (\"sitting on the ground,\" \"crouching,\" \"partially open\" umbrella). It successfully paints a full picture by including the setting, which is crucial for understanding the scene. It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental image of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption excels in following the specific rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that conveys all the necessary information without being overly long.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The primary focus is clearly on the man and woman, with the environment described to set the scene.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It masterfully combines details from the entire video progression using phrases like \"Initially...\" and \"As the scene unfolds...\" instead of referring to specific frames.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The description is almost entirely objective. It uses factual descriptors like \"dark jacket\" and \"medium-length dark hair.\" The phrase \"appears to be holding\" is an excellent way to describe an action with a degree of uncertainty without speculating.\n*   **Subject Identification and Detail:** It uses precise terms (\"woman,\" \"man,\" \"car\") and provides specific visual attributes for each, such as clothing color, style, and pose.\n*   **Order and Structure:** The caption follows a logical temporal order, describing the scene as it is revealed in the video, which is an effective strategy outlined in the instructions.\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement\nThe only minor deviation from the instructions is the use of the subjective adjective \"quiet\" in the phrase \"The setting suggests a quiet, outdoor area.\" The instruction states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" While \"quiet\" is a reasonable inference, a more strictly objective description would be: \"The setting is an outdoor area lined with hedges and a fence.\"\n\nDespite this very minor point, the caption is an excellent example of how to follow the instructions to produce a high-quality, descriptive summary of a video.",
