    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of people seated on a swing ride. The focus is on their legs and feet, which are visible as they dangle above a metallic platform. The individuals are wearing a variety of footwear, including sandals and closed shoes, and some are dressed in patterned pants. The scene captures the motion of the ride, with legs slightly elevated and swinging. The overall composition highlights the diversity in clothing and footwear among the riders.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively and accurately describes the video's content while adhering to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"group of people seated on a swing ride\" and precisely describes what is visible: their \"legs and feet,\" the \"metallic platform\" below, and the variety in their \"footwear\" and \"pants.\" The description of the motion—\"legs slightly elevated and swinging\"—is also a correct representation of the action.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It captures all the salient visual information available in the video. Since faces and upper bodies are not visible, the description rightly focuses on the lower legs, feet, and clothing. It avoids speculating about details that cannot be seen (like age, gender, or facial expressions), which is a key requirement of the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows the specific guidelines:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and brief summary in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly identifies the subjects as a group and describes their key visual attributes (footwear, pants).\n*   **No Speculation:** It strictly describes what is visible and avoids making assumptions.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Handling of Multiple Subjects:** It appropriately treats the subjects as a \"group\" and highlights their diversity, which is the correct approach when individuals are not distinct enough to be described separately.\n*   **Use of Motion/Background:** It mentions the \"swinging\" motion and the \"metallic platform,\" which are necessary details to provide context and understand the scene.\n\nThe only minor point for improvement is the use of slightly interpretive phrases like \"The focus is on...\" and \"The overall composition highlights...\". While true, the instructions favor direct description over commentary on the shot's composition. A more direct phrasing might be: \"The video shows the dangling legs and feet of a group of people on a swing ride above a metallic platform. The riders wear a variety of footwear, including sandals and closed shoes, and some have patterned pants.\"\n\nHowever, this is a very minor critique. The caption as written is excellent, clear, and fulfills all the core requirements of the prompt.",
