    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, where the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a single subject. A vast, turbulent mass of dark, brooding storm clouds dominates the sky, churning ominously over a wide, arid desert plain. The clouds are a deep grey, almost black in the densest areas, while a curtain of heavy rain is visible falling in the distance. The flat, brownish-yellow landscape below is sparsely covered with scrub brush and extends towards a faint mountain range on the horizon, creating a powerful sense of natural drama and scale.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape shot focused on a desert storm, it misses several key visual dynamics and uses subjective language contrary to the instructions. The description of the clouds as \"brooding\" and \"churning ominously\" is emotive; a more objective description would focus on their rapid, swirling movement from left to right and their texture, which appears dense and layered rather than uniformly dark. The caption also overlooks a crucial element of light: for a brief moment, a brilliant flash of sheet lightning illuminates the interior of the cloud mass, revealing a complex, cavernous structure of vapor that is otherwise unseen. Furthermore, the description of the desert plain as simply \"flat\" and \"brownish-yellow\" is an oversimplification. The video clearly shows a network of dry, cracked arroyos snaking across the foreground, and the wind is visibly whipping sand and dust into low-lying plumes that travel across the ground, adding a layer of motion that the caption fails to mention. Finally, the \"faint mountain range\" is not static; as the curtain of rain sweeps across the horizon, it partially obscures the mountains on the right while revealing a sharper, more defined peak on the left that was previously hidden, a transition the current description completely omits.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scene, focusing on the immense scale and dynamic atmosphere of a desert storm. A vast mass of dark storm clouds rapidly swirls from left to right, their dense, layered texture dominating the sky. A brilliant flash of sheet lightning briefly illuminates the cloud interior, revealing a complex, cavernous vapor structure. Below, the arid desert plain is intricately detailed with dry, cracked arroyos snaking across the foreground. The wind whips sand and dust into low-lying plumes that travel across the ground, adding motion to the scene.
