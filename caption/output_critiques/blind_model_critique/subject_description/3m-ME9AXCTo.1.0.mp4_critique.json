    "pre_caption": "A woman with long, straight, light-colored hair is seen primarily from the back and in profile, interacting closely with a man. The man has curly, light-colored, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a dark suit jacket with a white corsage on the lapel and a dark bowtie.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the two main subjects and their core action, but it lacks balance and key visual details, particularly concerning the woman. While the man's attire is described with specifics like a \"dark suit jacket,\" \"white corsage,\" and \"dark bowtie,\" the woman is only described by her hair. A significant visual element, her clothing—which could be a formal gown or even a wedding dress, given the context implied by the man's outfit—is completely omitted. The description of her hair as \"long, straight, light-colored\" is also quite generic; a more specific detail, such as it being styled in an elegant updo, would be more informative. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention their facial expressions, which are crucial in a video depicting a close interaction; for instance, they might be smiling warmly at each other. The initial phrase \"interacting closely\" is vague and made redundant by the more specific \"dancing and spinning\" that follows. The description could be improved by starting directly with the action and providing a more equitable level of detail for both individuals, including the style and color of the woman's dress and their mutual expressions, to create a more complete and vivid picture of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with long, light-colored hair styled in an elegant updo is seen dancing and spinning with a man. She is wearing a formal gown, possibly a wedding dress, which complements the man's attire. The man, with curly, light-colored, shoulder-length hair, is dressed in a dark suit jacket adorned with a white corsage and a dark bowtie. Both are shown in profile and from the back, smiling warmly at each other as they embrace, capturing a moment of joyful connection.",
