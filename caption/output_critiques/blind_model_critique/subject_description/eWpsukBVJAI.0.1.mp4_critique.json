    "pre_caption": "A fair-skinned man with short brown hair, wearing a black leather jacket over a collared shirt and tie with a badge on a chain, stands on the right, gesturing with one hand while holding a foamy glass of beer. Next to him stands a taller, fair-skinned man with curly brown hair and glasses, dressed in a brown suit, a white shirt, and a striped tie. To the left, another man with long dark hair and a beard, wearing a patterned jacket over a green shirt, drinks from a green bottle. In a booth, a woman with long blonde hair and a black beanie sits next to a woman with dark hair, glasses, and tattoos on her arm; both hold drinks. Other people, including a man with a grey beard and another man in a white shirt, are visible in the background, laughing and socializing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a detailed inventory of the individuals present, it lacks a central focus and fails to capture the dynamic interactions that define the scene. The description reads like a list of subjects rather than a cohesive narrative of a single moment. For instance, the man with the badge is gesturing, but the caption doesn't specify that he is speaking directly and intensely to the man in the suit, who appears to be listening intently, creating a clear focal point of conversation. The description of the badge as simply \"a badge on a chain\" misses a critical detail; in the video, it's clearly a gold detective's shield, which re-contextualizes the entire interaction. Furthermore, the flow is disjointed, moving from right to left and then to a separate booth. A better approach would be to establish the two central men first, then describe the other subjects in relation to them, such as the man on the left who is observing their conversation while pretending not to. The description of the women in the booth is also static; it omits that the woman with the beanie is leaning in to whisper to her friend, both of them occasionally glancing over at the two main speakers, suggesting they are discussing the central action. Finally, describing the background people as simply \"laughing and socializing\" misses the opportunity to use them to establish the noisy, crowded pub atmosphere that contrasts with the focused intensity of the main conversation.",
