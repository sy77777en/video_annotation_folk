    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a first-person view from someone lying in bed. Their bare feet and legs, covered by grey trousers, extend towards the foot of the bed, which has white bedding. The camera looks up towards a window with white frames and drawn curtains, through which green trees and part of a vehicle are visible outside. The bedroom walls are a pale yellow, and furniture including a mirror, a dresser, a picture frame, and a bookshelf can be seen. The video then transitions to display a static, abstract image featuring a complex, symmetrical pattern made of thin, glowing green lines against a dark brown, subtly textured background. The pattern resembles a kaleidoscope or a stylized web radiating from the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately follows the sequence of events but contains a contradiction and misses opportunities for more precise detail as required by the instructions. The phrase \"bare feet and legs, covered by dark trousers\" is confusing; in the video, the person's bare feet and ankles are visible at the end of their dark-colored trouser legs, a detail that should be clarified. The caption also fails to describe the transition between the two segments; the view of the bedroom ceiling does not simply cut but rather dissolves slowly into the abstract pattern, creating a dreamlike effect. Furthermore, while the bedroom furniture is listed, more specific attributes could be noted, such as the medium wood tone of the dresser and the black-and-white photograph within the picture frame. The description of the pattern's motion as \"changes continuously\" is too general; the video shows the green lines not just changing but specifically pulsing with light and slowly rotating from the central point, which are key visual attributes of its movement.",
