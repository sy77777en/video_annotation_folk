    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of a powerful weather event rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark grey supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, its turbulent, rotating base lowering towards a flat, dark plain. To the right, a heavy rain shaft visibly connects the cloud to the ground, while a stark contrast is created on the left by a break in the clouds, revealing a patch of bright blue sky and brilliantly lit white cloud formations. The overwhelming size of the storm is further emphasized by the tiny silhouettes of a lone tree and a distant, slender tower on the horizon, which serve to highlight the sheer power of the natural spectacle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively identifies the main subject as a supercell storm, it relies too heavily on subjective and interpretive language such as \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" and \"overwhelming,\" which the instructions advise against. The description also treats the scene as a static photograph rather than a video; for instance, it mentions a \"rotating base\" but fails to describe the actual motion visible in the video, such as the slow, clockwise rotation of the wall cloud or the subtle shifting of the rain shaft across the landscape. The term \"flat, dark plain\" is too generic; in the video, I can clearly see the texture of green agricultural fields and the faint outline of a paved road cutting across the land, details that are missed. Furthermore, the \"slender tower\" is clearly identifiable as a modern wind turbine, and its blades are visibly turning slowly in the wind, a specific detail that adds context and should be included instead of the more ambiguous term. The opening phrase \"This video captures\" is unnecessary meta-commentary and should be removed to create a more direct and immersive description of the visual content itself.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A colossal, dark grey supercell storm cloud dominates the sky, its turbulent, rotating base lowering towards a landscape of green agricultural fields and a faintly visible paved road. The slow, clockwise rotation of the wall cloud is evident, adding to the dynamic nature of the scene. To the right, a heavy rain shaft subtly shifts across the landscape, connecting the cloud to the ground. On the left, a break in the clouds reveals a patch of bright blue sky and brilliantly lit white cloud formations. The immense scale of the storm is highlighted by the tiny silhouette of a lone tree and a modern wind turbine on the horizon, its blades turning slowly in the wind, underscoring the power of this natural spectacle.",
