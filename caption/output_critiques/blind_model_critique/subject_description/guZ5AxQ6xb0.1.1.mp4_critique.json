    "pre_caption": "In a basketball game, a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the red number 3 is in mid-air, shooting an orange basketball with his right hand. He wears black shorts with a red stripe and black leggings. Attempting to block the shot are three opposing players in white \"SIXERS\" jerseys with blue shorts. One player, with his arm raised high, wears a jersey with a partially visible blue number. To his right, another player in a jersey with the red number 11 also jumps to block. A third player, wearing the number 12 in red, stands beneath the shooter. Other players, including a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the number 50, watch the play. The camera follows the orange basketball as it arcs toward the hoop and falls through the white net of the basket, which is attached to a blue and red support structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a basketball game in a stadium with a packed audience in the background. In the foreground, several players are in action, including a player in black attempting a shot while a player in white jumps to block. The camera then zooms in on the basketball as it goes into the basket.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a strong foundation, it could be enhanced by incorporating more dynamic detail and refining its descriptive language. The description of the main shooter, the man in the black \"HEAT\" jersey, could be more specific by including his facial expression, which is likely one of intense concentration, and any other visible features like a short-cropped hairstyle. The positioning of the defenders could be clarified; for instance, instead of stating one player is \"to his right,\" specify the position relative to the shooter to avoid ambiguity. The description of the third defender, number 12, as \"standing\" seems improbable; he is more likely jumping or moving dynamically to contest the shot. The phrase \"The camera follows the orange basketball\" describes the filmmaking process rather than the visual content; it would be more direct to state, \"The orange basketball arcs through the air...\" Furthermore, a video of this play would likely feature a slow-motion sequence of the shot followed by a hard cut to the ball falling through the net in real-time, a transition that is currently missing from the description. Finally, the general mention of \"Other players\" could be improved by briefly noting their specific actions, such as the man in the #50 jersey positioning himself under the basket for a potential rebound, which would add more context to the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a thrilling basketball game, a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the red number 3 leaps into the air, his face a mask of intense concentration as he shoots an orange basketball with his right hand. His short-cropped hair and focused expression highlight his determination. He wears black shorts with a red stripe and black leggings. Three opposing players in white \"SIXERS\" jerseys with blue shorts attempt to block the shot. One defender, with his arm raised high, wears a jersey with a partially visible blue number and is positioned directly in front of the shooter. To the shooter's left, another player in a jersey with the red number 11 also jumps to contest the shot. A third player, wearing the number 12 in red, leaps beneath the shooter, adding to the defensive pressure. The orange basketball arcs gracefully through the air, captured in slow motion, before a hard cut shows it falling through the white net of the basket, which is attached to a blue and red support structure. Meanwhile, other players, including a Black man in a black \"HEAT\" jersey with the number 50, position themselves strategically under the basket, ready for a potential rebound.",
