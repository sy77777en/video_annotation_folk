    "pre_caption": "The video features a dense crowd of stylized, computer-generated human figures. All the figures are rendered in a uniform white color and have a low-polygon, faceted appearance, giving them a geometric and abstract quality. They lack detailed facial features, skin texture, or specific clothing patterns, creating a sense of anonymity. Despite the abstraction, the figures are depicted wearing simple, modern clothing, such as a hoodie on a central male-presenting figure. The crowd is composed of figures with varied, though simplified, hairstyles and body shapes, suggesting a mix of genders. The figures are standing and walking amongst each other, with the camera's shallow depth of field bringing different individuals into and out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The description accurately captures the general aesthetic of the low-polygon, stylized figures and the shallow depth of field. However, it misses a crucial compositional element by stating the figures are a \"uniform white color.\" In the video, while the vast majority of the crowd is white, the camera's movement deliberately leads to and settles on a single, otherwise identical figure rendered in a vibrant, solid red, which serves as the video's primary focal point and is completely omitted from the caption. The description also oversimplifies the scene by stating all figures are \"posed as if walking.\" Several distinct groups are not walking; one cluster of figures is shown standing still and looking up towards the sky, while another pair is frozen in a pose that suggests they are in the middle of a conversation, turned to face one another. Finally, while a figure in a hoodie is briefly in focus, the caption's emphasis on it as a \"central\" figure is misleading. The camera gives equal, if not more, screen time to a female-presenting figure with a distinct, geometric bob haircut and the aforementioned red figure, making the focus more of a shifting narrative between three key subjects rather than centered on one.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a dense crowd of stylized, computer-generated human figures, predominantly rendered in a uniform white color with a low-polygon, faceted appearance, giving them a geometric and abstract quality. However, the camera's movement highlights a single figure in vibrant red, serving as the video's primary focal point. The figures lack detailed facial features, skin texture, or specific clothing patterns, creating a sense of anonymity. Despite the abstraction, they are depicted in simple, modern clothing. The scene features a dynamic interplay of figures: some are walking, while distinct groups are stationary, such as a cluster looking up at the sky and a pair engaged in conversation. The camera's shallow depth of field shifts focus among three key subjects—a male-presenting figure in a hoodie, a female-presenting figure with a geometric bob haircut, and the striking red figure—creating a narrative of shifting attention rather than a single central focus.",
