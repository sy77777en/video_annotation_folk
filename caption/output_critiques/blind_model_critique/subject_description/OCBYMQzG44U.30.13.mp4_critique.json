    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a stark, modernistic room. The space is defined by its curved walls, which feature a two-tone design with a dark, textured lower section and a smooth, off-white upper portion that blends into the ceiling where several recessed lights cast a soft, greenish-hued glow. A striking geometric pattern of large white and black tiles dominates the floor, and a narrow, arched doorway is visible in the distance. There is no main subject, as the focus is deliberately placed on the architectural space itself. The wide, low-angle perspective emphasizes the room's unusual curves, stark contrasts, and enigmatic, empty atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by correctly identifying the scene as an interior architectural shot and detailing the room's core features like the curved, two-tone walls and tiled floor. However, it misses several key dynamic and specific visual elements present in the video. Firstly, it fails to mention the slow, deliberate rightward pan of the camera, which is essential for understanding the scale and continuous nature of the curved space. Secondly, while the greenish light is noted, the caption omits the prominent, moving reflections this light casts across the glossy black floor tiles as the camera moves, a key visual effect. The description of the distant arched doorway is also incomplete; the video shows a glimpse of a deep blue wall through it, creating a significant color contrast that the caption misses. Finally, the description could be more precise; the 'textured' lower wall is clearly shown to have fine vertical ribbing, and the 'geometric pattern' on the floor is a simple checkerboard. Replacing subjective terms like 'striking' and 'enigmatic' with a more direct description of the room's emptiness and high-contrast lighting would also strengthen the objectivity of the caption.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures an interior architectural scene of a stark, modernistic room, focusing on its unique design elements. The camera slowly pans rightward, revealing the continuous, curved space defined by two-tone walls with a fine vertical ribbing on the dark lower section and a smooth, off-white upper portion. Recessed lights in the ceiling cast a soft, greenish glow, creating moving reflections across the glossy black tiles of the simple checkerboard floor pattern. A narrow, arched doorway in the distance offers a glimpse of a deep blue wall, adding a striking color contrast. The wide, low-angle perspective highlights the room's unusual curves, high-contrast lighting, and empty atmosphere, emphasizing the architectural space itself.",
