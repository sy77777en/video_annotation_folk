    "pre_caption": "The video features a young person and an older man, both wearing white hooded suits with orange stripes. They have goggles resting on their foreheads. The young person, with short blonde hair visible under the hood, has a fair skin tone and a focused expression. The older man, with a mustache and a fair skin tone, appears concerned. Both subjects are facing forward, suggesting they are looking at something directly ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few key areas where it fails to adhere strictly to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is largely accurate in its description of the subjects' physical attributes. It correctly identifies their clothing (\"white hooded suits with orange stripes\"), accessories (\"goggles resting on their foreheads\"), and individual features (\"short blonde hair,\" \"mustache,\" \"fair skin tone\"). However, the descriptions of their expressions as \"focused\" and \"concerned\" are interpretations of emotion rather than objective descriptions of facial features.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the two main subjects, provides sufficient detail to distinguish between them (age, hair, facial hair), and describes their shared and individual attributes in a clear, synthesized manner. It covers the most essential visual information as requested.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows most of the instructions well, but it violates two specific rules:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It correctly focuses on the subjects and their visual attributes without mentioning the background.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It effectively distinguishes between the two subjects using their unique characteristics.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    1.  **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** The instruction explicitly states to avoid this. The caption describes the older man as appearing \"concerned\" and the young person as having a \"focused expression.\" While \"focused\" can sometimes be a physical description, \"concerned\" is a clear interpretation of emotion. A better, more objective description would be to describe the facial features themselves (e.g., \"with a furrowed brow and downturned mouth\").\n    2.  **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\":** The final sentence, \"suggesting they are looking at something directly ahead,\" is an inference about the subjects' actions and gaze. It speculates on something that is not visible in the scene (the object of their attention). The instruction is to describe only what is visibly present. A more compliant description would simply state their orientation, such as \"Both subjects are facing forward.\"",
