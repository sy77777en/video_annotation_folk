    "pre_caption": "The video features a young person and an older man, both wearing white hooded suits with orange stripes. They have goggles resting on their foreheads. The young person, with short blonde hair visible under the hood, has a fair skin tone and a focused expression. The older man, with a mustache and a fair skin tone, appears concerned. Both subjects are facing forward, suggesting they are looking at something directly ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the two subjects and their distinctive suits, but it misses key details about their actions and interactions that provide crucial context. The description of them \"facing forward\" is too static; in the video, the young woman is actively leaning towards a control panel, her fingers poised over the keys, while the older man stands just behind her left shoulder, looking down at the same console. This positioning establishes a clear working relationship that the caption omits. Furthermore, the caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives by using \"focused\" and \"concerned.\" Instead, it should describe the physical attributes that convey these states, such as \"the young woman's brow is slightly furrowed and her lips are pressed together,\" and \"the older man's eyes are wide and his mustache sits above a slightly open mouth.\" Finally, the description of the suits could be more specific; they are full-body, synthetic-looking hazmat suits, and a small, circular blue logo is visible on the left breast of each suit, a detail that would help in uniquely identifying them.",
