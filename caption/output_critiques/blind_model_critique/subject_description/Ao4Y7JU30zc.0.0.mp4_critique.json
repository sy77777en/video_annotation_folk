    "pre_caption": "A man with a shaved head is seen in silhouette, sitting alone on a bench in what appears to be a dark, hazy locker room. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved hooded sweatshirt, dark pants, and dark sneakers. Leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands clasped, he keeps his head bowed in a contemplative posture. He remains mostly still, at one point briefly raising a fist to his chin. The scene is lit dramatically from one side, casting a long shadow on the wall behind him and obscuring his facial features.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. The caption is very good, but it has a few minor issues when judged strictly against the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a man and precisely describes his physical state and appearance: shaved head, silhouette, dark clothing (hoodie, pants, sneakers), and specific posture (sitting on a bench, leaning forward, elbows on knees, hands clasped, head bowed). The description of the lighting and its effect (obscuring features, casting a shadow) is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It provides a comprehensive summary of the video's content, focusing on the single, salient subject. It captures his static nature (\"remains mostly still\") as well as the one minor action (\"briefly raising a fist to his chin\"), giving a full sense of the scene without needing to reference specific moments.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but it violates two specific rules.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is concise yet informative, using simple and natural English.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the main subject and describes his key visual attributes in detail.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It successfully combines details from the video into a single summary without referring to \"frames\" or \"images.\"\n*   **Objectivity (Mostly):** It accurately notes that the man's facial features are obscured rather than guessing his expression.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to the instructions:**\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"in a **contemplative** posture\" and \"lit **dramatically**.\" \"Contemplative\" describes a mental state, which is a subjective interpretation. \"Dramatically\" is a subjective assessment of the lighting. A better, more objective description would be to simply state the physical pose (\"...he keeps his head bowed\") and the lighting style (\"The scene is lit from one side...\").\n2.  **Speculation:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption says the man is \"in what **appears to be** a dark, hazy locker room.\" Using \"appears to be\" acknowledges the uncertainty, but the instruction is to avoid the speculation altogether. It would be more compliant to describe only what is certain, such as \"sitting alone on a bench in a dark, hazy room.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent in its descriptive quality and accuracy, but to be perfect according to the strict rules provided, it should remove the subjective words (\"contemplative,\" \"dramatically\") and the speculative detail about the location (\"locker room\").",
