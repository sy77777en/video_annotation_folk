    "pre_caption": "This is a surreal interior scenery shot of a liminal space, characterized by a long, narrow hallway flooded with dark, rippling water. The walls and ceiling are uniformly covered in glossy white tiles, illuminated by a series of stark, square light fixtures that cast a sterile, clinical glow. A simple metal handrail lines a narrow walkway on the right side of the flooded passage, which recedes into the distance where a large, yellow rubber duck with wide eyes floats in an alcove. There is no main subject because the focus is on the disquieting atmosphere and the unsettling scale of the environment itself. The combination of familiar architectural elements with the bizarre flooding and the out-of-place object creates a dreamlike and unnerving mood, making the space, rather than any single element within it, the central point of interest.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions, most notably the rule against using subjective and emotional language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as an interior hallway, flooded with water, with tiled walls, specific lighting, a handrail, and a large yellow rubber duck. The visual details are described correctly.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete, capturing all the salient visual elements of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **FAIL: Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption is filled with them, including: \"surreal,\" \"disquieting,\" \"unsettling,\" \"sterile, clinical,\" \"bizarre,\" \"dreamlike,\" and \"unnerving.\" These words describe the mood and the viewer's potential emotional reaction, which is explicitly forbidden.\n*   **FAIL: Conciseness:** The instructions ask for a \"concise yet informative description.\" While informative, the caption is verbose. The final two sentences, which are meant to justify it as a scenery shot, are particularly long and repetitive. The entire explanation of the \"mood\" and \"atmosphere\" is based on the forbidden subjective language.\n*   **PARTIAL FAIL: Scenery Shot Description:** The instructions for a scenery shot state to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot\" and \"briefly explain why there is no main subject... using one to three sentences.\" The caption correctly identifies it as a scenery shot but its explanation is neither brief nor objective. It uses three long sentences that rely entirely on the subjective feelings the scene is meant to evoke, rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **MINOR FAIL: Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"This is a...\", which is a form of introductory text. A better caption would launch directly into the description (e.g., \"An interior scenery shot shows a long, narrow hallway...\").\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes what is in the video, it does so in a style that is the opposite of what the instructions demand. It focuses on interpreting the scene's mood and emotional impact, using subjective and interpretive language, instead of providing a purely objective and factual visual description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Interior scenery shot of a long, narrow hallway flooded with dark water. The walls and ceiling are covered in glossy white tiles, illuminated by square light fixtures. A metal handrail lines a narrow walkway on the right side. A large yellow rubber duck floats in an alcove at the end of the passage. The focus is on the architectural elements and the unusual presence of water and the rubber duck, with no main subject.",
