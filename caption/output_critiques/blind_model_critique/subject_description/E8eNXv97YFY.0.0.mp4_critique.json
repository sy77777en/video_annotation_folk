    "pre_caption": "This video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a spacious public square under a dramatic, cloud-filled sky. The video lacks a single main subject, as the wide-angle perspective and camera movement emphasize the expansive atmosphere and architectural features of the location rather than any particular individual or object. At the heart of the reddish-brown tiled plaza stands a tall, slender white monument with an ornate, golden, traditional-style top, surrounded by a decorative pool, benches, and green trees, including a prominent palm tree.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape of a public square and notes the central monument, it mischaracterizes the scene by stating there is no main subject. The tall, slender white monument is clearly the primary focal point around which the camera pans, and the description should present it as such. The caption also omits key environmental and contextual details; for instance, it fails to mention the warm, golden light of a setting sun that casts long, distinct shadows from the monument and the surrounding buildings across the reddish-brown tiles. Furthermore, the reference to \"architectural features\" is too vague, as it neglects to describe the prominent multi-story, sand-colored buildings with arched entryways and wrought-iron balconies that frame the square. Finally, the description misses the human element entirely; although not the focus, several small figures can be seen strolling across the plaza and sitting on the benches, which adds a crucial sense of scale and life to the expansive space.",
