Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance against the instructions.\n\n### Caption Evaluation\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the essence of the video but violates a few key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and accurately describes its visual components: \"green forested mountains,\" a \"partly cloudy sky,\" and \"mist gently rolling over the mountain peaks.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. As per the instructions for scenery shots, it correctly explains that there is no main subject by stating, \"The focus is on the expansive environment... rather than any specific object.\" It provides enough detail for a reader to understand the nature of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Correctly Follows Scenery Shot Rule:** It identifies the video as a scenery shot and explains why there is no main subject, adhering perfectly to that specific guideline.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Clarity and Focus:** It clearly describes the visual attributes of the landscape (mountains, trees, sky, mist).\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** This is the most significant violation. The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several:\n    *   \"lush\" (borderline, but leans subjective)\n    *   \"natural **beauty**\" (clearly subjective)\n    *   \"**tranquility** and **grandeur**\" (describes emotions and atmosphere, which is subjective)\n*   **Conciseness:** The instructions for scenery shots suggest a length of \"one to three sentences.\" This caption is four sentences long. While a minor deviation, it could be more concise by removing the final subjective sentence.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is good because it is accurate, well-structured, and correctly follows the specific rule for describing a scenery shot. However, it fails to be a *perfect* caption because it violates the crucial instruction to avoid subjective and emotional language.",
