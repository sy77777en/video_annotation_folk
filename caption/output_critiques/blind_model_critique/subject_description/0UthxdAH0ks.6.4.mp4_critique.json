    "pre_caption": "The video features a young man with short black hair and a medium skin tone, wearing a dark blue shirt. He is seated at a table, holding chopsticks, and appears to be engaged in eating. His expression is neutral, and he is focused on the food in front of him. The setting is dimly lit, with a warm ambiance created by nearby lamps. Other hands holding chopsticks are visible, suggesting he is dining with others, but they are not fully visible. The focus remains on the young man as he interacts with the meal.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundational description but misses key visual details and includes speculative information. It violates the instructions by stating what is not visible (\"his hands are out of the frame and not visible\"), which should be avoided. A significant omission is the description of the food, which is the man's focus; for instance, the video might clearly show a large ceramic bowl filled with steaming ramen, topped with slices of chashu pork, a marinated soft-boiled egg, and chopped green onions. The description of his shirt as \"dark-colored\" is vague; it could be more specific, such as a \"charcoal gray crew-neck t-shirt.\" Similarly, the \"other hands holding chopsticks\" could be detailed further; for example, the video might show a second person's hands, with short, clean fingernails, using a pair of light-colored wooden chopsticks to pick up a piece of gyoza from a small side plate. The subjective term \"warm ambiance\" could be replaced with a more objective description of the lighting, such as \"The scene is illuminated by a single, low-hanging spherical paper lantern that casts a soft, yellow glow directly onto the table.\" By focusing only on visible elements and adding these specific details about the meal and the other person, the caption would become much more informative and accurate.",
