    "pre_caption": "The video features a young man with short black hair and a medium skin tone, wearing a dark blue shirt. He is seated at a table, holding chopsticks, and appears to be engaged in eating. His expression is neutral, and he is focused on the food in front of him. The setting is dimly lit, with a warm ambiance created by nearby lamps. Other hands holding chopsticks are visible, suggesting he is dining with others, but they are not fully visible. The focus remains on the young man as he interacts with the meal.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few specific areas where it deviates from the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is accurate. It describes a plausible scene with a clear main subject (\"a young man\") and provides specific, verifiable details about his appearance (\"short black hair,\" \"medium skin tone,\" \"dark blue shirt\") and actions (\"seated at a table, holding chopsticks\").\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete in its description of the main subject, covering his appearance, pose, and actions as instructed. It also acknowledges other elements (\"other hands holding chopsticks\") but correctly keeps them secondary, which aligns with the instruction to \"describe the main subject in detail and briefly mention the secondary subjects.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows most of the instructions well, but it fails on a few key points.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly identifies the man as the primary subject and focuses the description on him.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or referencing specific moments in time.\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"young man,\" \"hands,\" \"chopsticks\") and describes the man's key visual attributes in detail.\n*   **Prioritization:** It correctly starts with the main subject before mentioning the secondary elements.\n*   **Language and Tone:** The language is simple and natural, and it avoids subjective or emotional adjectives by using \"neutral\" to describe his expression.\n\n**Where the caption can be improved:**\n\n*   **Violation: Avoids Speculation:** The caption states, \"...suggesting he is dining with others...\" This is an interpretation, not a direct observation. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" A better approach would be to simply state the facts: \"Other hands holding chopsticks are also visible at the table.\"\n*   **Minor Violation: Describing the Background:** The caption mentions, \"The setting is dimly lit, with a warm ambiance created by nearby lamps.\" The instruction says to \"**Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects...**\" While the lighting adds context, it is not essential for describing the man or the other hands, making its inclusion a minor deviation from the rule.\n*   **Minor Violation: Introductory Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\" This is an unnecessary introductory phrase. The instructions call for a direct description, which would be more concise if it started immediately with the subject (e.g., \"A young man with short black hair...\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is strong in its description of the main subject but needs to be stricter in avoiding interpretation and background details to fully comply with the instructions.",
