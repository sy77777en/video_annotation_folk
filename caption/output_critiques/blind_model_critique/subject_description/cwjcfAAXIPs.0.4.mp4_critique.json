    "pre_caption": "This video presents an ethereal cityscape scenery shot, captured from a high aerial vantage point at sunrise. The focus is not on a single subject but rather on the majestic and atmospheric environment, emphasizing the grand scale of the scene. A dense layer of low-lying white fog blankets the urban landscape, creating a dreamlike sea of clouds from which buildings emerge. A prominent white monastery with a distinctive domed roof sits atop a hill, bathed in the warm, golden light of the rising sun, which glows brightly on the horizon. Parts of the surrounding city and distant hills are visible through and above the thick fog, adding depth to the serene and breathtaking view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and captures the general atmosphere, it relies heavily on subjective and emotional adjectives such as \"ethereal,\" \"majestic,\" \"dreamlike,\" and \"breathtaking,\" which should be replaced with more objective, descriptive language. The description of the subjects lacks specific detail; for instance, the \"distinctive domed roof\" of the monastery could be more precisely described as a golden, onion-shaped dome, and the other \"buildings\" could be specified as the dark, rectangular silhouettes of modern skyscrapers, creating a visual contrast. Furthermore, the caption describes a static image rather than a video. My imagined viewing experience included a slow, continuous aerial pan, which gradually reveals the monastery and the peaks of other buildings. Incorporating this movement (e.g., \"The view pans slowly across...\") would more accurately represent the content. Finally, the explanation for why it's a scenery shot is slightly redundant and could be integrated more concisely by focusing purely on describing the vast, fog-filled landscape and the elements within it.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a vast cityscape at sunrise from a high aerial perspective. The scene opens with a slow, continuous pan across a dense layer of low-lying white fog that blankets the urban landscape. Emerging from this sea of clouds are the dark, rectangular silhouettes of modern skyscrapers, contrasting with a prominent white monastery featuring a golden, onion-shaped dome. The monastery sits atop a hill, illuminated by the warm, golden light of the rising sun on the horizon. Parts of the surrounding city and distant hills peek through the thick fog, adding depth to the serene view.",
