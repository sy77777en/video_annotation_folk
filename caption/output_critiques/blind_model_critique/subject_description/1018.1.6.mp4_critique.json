    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a scene inside a narrow, green train corridor. Initially, a man in a green uniform with a cap is seen walking towards the camera. He has a mustache and carries a large, brown animal, possibly a dog, in his arms. Following him is another man wearing a white shirt and a red hat, holding a small, white dog. The corridor's design features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, contributing to the setting's vintage train ambiance. The subjects are revealed as they move closer to the camera, emphasizing their uniforms and the animals they carry.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption incorrectly focuses on the setting and the progression of the video (\"The video begins with an empty... corridor,\" \"As the men move closer\") rather than providing a concise, subject-focused description as instructed. The mention of the \"patterned floor,\" \"windows,\" and \"vintage train ambiance\" is superfluous background detail. The description of the objects is also too hesitant; the \"wrapped object that resembles a tree\" is clearly a small Christmas tree with its base wrapped in burlap, and stating the \"nature\" of the second object is \"unclear\" violates the rule against describing uncertainties. Instead, you should describe its visible form, such as \"a stack of white, round plates.\" Furthermore, the descriptions of the men lack sufficient detail. The first man could be described as a young, clean-shaven man, and the second as an older man with a short white beard, which would provide context for his Santa hat. The description should be a single, direct paragraph focusing only on the two men and their specific attributes and carried items, omitting any reference to the corridor or the camera's perspective.",
