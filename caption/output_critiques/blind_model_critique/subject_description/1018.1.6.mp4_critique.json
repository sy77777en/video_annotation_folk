    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a scene inside a narrow, green train corridor. Initially, a man in a green uniform with a cap is seen walking towards the camera. He has a mustache and carries a large, brown animal, possibly a dog, in his arms. Following him is another man wearing a white shirt and a red hat, holding a small, white dog. The corridor's design features a patterned floor and windows on the right side, contributing to the setting's vintage train ambiance. The subjects are revealed as they move closer to the camera, emphasizing their uniforms and the animals they carry.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent and detailed evaluation of the caption. Here is a breakdown of its performance based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good. It successfully captures the essential information of the video, is well-structured, and follows most of the complex instructions closely. However, there are a few minor areas where it could be improved to align perfectly with the rules.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy\n*   **Excellent:** The description of the subjects is accurate. It correctly identifies two men and two animals, providing specific details about their clothing (\"green uniform with a cap,\" \"white shirt and a red hat\") and the animals' appearance (\"large, brown animal,\" \"small, white dog\").\n*   **Excellent:** The caption correctly handles uncertainty by stating the first animal is \"possibly a dog,\" which is a perfect application of the rule \"avoid describing what you are unsure about.\"\n\n#### Completeness\n*   **Very Good:** The caption provides a complete picture of the salient subjects and their primary actions (walking towards the camera, carrying animals).\n*   **Good:** It includes relevant details about the setting (\"narrow, green train corridor,\" \"patterned floor,\" \"windows\"), which is appropriate here as the setting is prominent and provides necessary context for the subjects' appearance and actions.\n*   **Good:** It correctly notes the dynamic nature of the scene by mentioning that \"The subjects are revealed as they move closer to the camera.\"\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\n\nHere’s a point-by-point analysis of how the caption adheres to the specific rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative Paragraph:** **(✓) Yes.** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Avoid \"image\" or \"frame\":** **(✓) Yes.** These terms are not used.\n*   **Avoid Unnecessary Background/Motion:** **(✓) Mostly.** The background is mentioned, but it's justified as it provides essential context (\"train corridor\").\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** **(✗) Minor Violation.** The phrase \"vintage train ambiance\" is subjective. \"Vintage\" and \"ambiance\" describe a feeling or interpretation rather than a direct visual attribute. A more objective description would be: \"The corridor's design, with a patterned floor and side windows, is characteristic of an older style of train.\"\n*   **Avoid Describing the Unseen:** **(✓) Yes.** The use of \"possibly a dog\" is a great example of adhering to this rule.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** **(✓) Yes.** It uses \"man\" and \"animal/dog.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** **(✓) Yes.** It describes clothing, facial hair, and animal characteristics.\n*   **Distinguish Multiple Subjects:** **(✓) Yes.** It clearly distinguishes \"a man in a green uniform\" from \"another man wearing a white shirt.\"\n*   **Logical Order of Description:** **(✓) Yes.** It describes the subjects in the order they would likely be noticed (the man in front, followed by the man behind him).\n*   **Avoid Introductory Text:** **(✗) Minor Violation.** The caption begins with \"The video reveals a scene...\" The instructions state to return \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A better start would be to jump directly into the description, for example: \"Inside a narrow, green train corridor, a man in a green uniform...\"\n*   **Describe Revealing/Disappearing Subjects:** **(✓) Yes.** The final sentence explicitly mentions that \"The subjects are revealed as they move closer to the camera.\" However, this sentence is slightly redundant given the opening phrase and could be integrated more smoothly.\n\n### Conclusion and How to Improve\n\nThe caption is very effective and close to perfect. To make it fully compliant with all instructions, the following minor changes could be made:\n\n1.  **Remove the introductory phrase:** Start the description directly.\n2.  **Replace the subjective term:** Change \"vintage train ambiance\" to a more objective description of the style.\n3.  **Improve conciseness:** The idea of the subjects being \"revealed\" is mentioned at the beginning and end. This could be streamlined.\n\n**Revised (Improved) Version:**\n\nInside a narrow, green train corridor with a patterned floor, a man in a green uniform, cap, and mustache walks toward the camera, carrying a large, brown animal, possibly a dog, in his arms. Following him is a second man wearing a white shirt and a red hat, who holds a small, white dog. The men and the animals they are carrying become clearer as they advance down the corridor.",
