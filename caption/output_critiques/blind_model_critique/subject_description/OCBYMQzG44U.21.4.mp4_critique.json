    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, ascending staircase. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of mystery and anticipation as the camera's perspective moves steadily upwards. The wide staircase is enclosed by walls and a ceiling covered in small, white, square tiles with a faint greenish hue, flanked by simple, thin black handrails. An intensely bright, white, and hazy light floods the space from the top of the stairs, obscuring the destination and lending the scene an ethereal, almost otherworldly quality.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the video as a scenery shot of an ascending staircase but includes excessive subjective language such as \"sterile,\" \"mystery,\" \"anticipation,\" and \"ethereal,\" which the instructions prohibit. The description of the tiles as having a \"faint greenish hue\" is misleading; the video shows the white tiles are reflecting the cool, blue-green light from recessed LED strips running along the ceiling of the stairwell, a detail that is omitted. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention that the stair treads themselves are made of smooth, poured concrete, creating a textural contrast with the small, glossy tiles on the walls. The \"intensely bright, white, and hazy light\" is not hazy but is actually sharp, direct sunlight originating from a large, floor-to-ceiling, frameless glass window that becomes fully visible once the camera reaches the top landing. The final description of the \"open space\" is too vague; as the camera pans slowly to the right, it reveals a vast gallery with polished concrete floors and, against the distant wall, a single long, low-profile bench made of dark wood, which serves as a focal point that the caption completely overlooks. The description should be revised to include these specific material details, the precise source of the light, and the concrete objects revealed in the final pan, while removing all emotional and atmospheric interpretations.",

The staircase is wide, with smooth, poured concrete treads, enclosed by walls and a ceiling covered in small, white, square tiles.
