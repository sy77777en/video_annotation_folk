    "pre_caption": "The video features two men in a desolate, outdoor setting. The first man, on the left, is wearing a dark military-style uniform with a helmet and visor, holding a rifle. He appears to be gesturing with one hand. The second man, on the right, is dressed in an orange hazmat suit with a helmet and visor, carrying a backpack and a device on his chest. He stands facing forward, seemingly observing the surroundings. The scene conveys a sense of caution and preparedness, with both men equipped for a hazardous environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to fully adhere to the provided instructions. While it follows many of the rules correctly, it contains a significant violation regarding subjectivity and interpretation.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be factually accurate based on the visual details it provides. It describes two men, their distinct and specific attire (military uniform vs. hazmat suit), the gear they are carrying (rifle, backpack, chest device), and their relative positions and actions (gesturing, observing). The use of cautious phrasing like \"appears to be\" and \"seemingly\" is appropriate for describing actions that might be ambiguous.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is reasonably complete. It successfully identifies the main subjects and provides sufficient detail about their key visual attributes (clothing, gear, pose) to allow a reader to visualize the scene. It correctly omits details that are likely obscured by the subjects' helmets and uniforms (e.g., facial features, hairstyle), adhering to the rule \"avoid describing what is not visible.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Conciseness and Structure:** It is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It clearly identifies the subjects as \"two men\" and distinguishes them effectively by location (\"on the left,\" \"on the right\") and appearance.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It focuses on objective visual attributes like clothing color/style and objects being held.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where it violates the instructions:**\n*   **Subjectivity and Interpretation:** The most significant violation is the final sentence: **\"The scene conveys a sense of caution and preparedness, with both men equipped for a hazardous environment.\"**\n    *   The instruction explicitly states: **\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\"** and **\"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"**\n    *   Describing a \"sense of caution and preparedness\" is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood and the characters' internal states. These are not direct visual facts. The caption should only state that they are wearing specific gear; the *reason* for the gear (preparedness for a hazardous environment) is an inference that the reader should make for themselves.\n*   The use of the word **\"desolate\"** in the first sentence is also borderline subjective, though it can sometimes be used as a visual descriptor for a barren or empty landscape. However, combined with the final sentence, it contributes to an overall tone of interpretation rather than objective description.\n\nTo be considered a \"good\" caption under these rules, the final sentence should have been omitted entirely. The description of the men and their gear is sufficient to imply the context without stating it subjectively.",
