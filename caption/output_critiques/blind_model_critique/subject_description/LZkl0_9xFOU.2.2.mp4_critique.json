    "pre_caption": "The video opens with a focused view of a small, black, boxy monitor displaying the green-tinted original Xbox dashboard. The menu, featuring options like \"MEMORY,\" \"MUSIC,\" \"XBOX LIVE,\" and \"SETTINGS,\" surrounds a large, translucent green Xbox logo. In the blurred background, a black Xbox console and a controller are partially visible. The focus then smoothly shifts from the monitor to a large, black original Xbox controller, which appears to float in the midground. The controller has a prominent, glowing yellow and green \"XBOX\" logo at its center, while the monitor and console behind it become out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the video's subjects and the focus pull transition, but it could be more precise and visually descriptive. The \"large, black original Xbox controller\" is clearly the iconic \"Duke\" model, and mentioning this name would add valuable specificity. While the caption notes the controller's central logo, it overlooks other defining features clearly visible in the close-up, such as its asymmetrical analog sticks and the distinct black and white face buttons. There is also a spatial inaccuracy; the caption states the monitor is \"in front of\" the controller after the focus shift, but the visuals clearly show the controller is positioned between the camera and the monitor, with the monitor becoming the blurred background. Furthermore, the description of the dashboard as \"green-tinted\" is an understatement; the video highlights the iconic, pulsating green orb of energy within the translucent Xbox logo, a key animated detail that is missed. Lastly, the \"partially visible\" console in the background is more identifiable than described, as the characteristic X-shaped design on its top casing is discernible even while out of focus.",
