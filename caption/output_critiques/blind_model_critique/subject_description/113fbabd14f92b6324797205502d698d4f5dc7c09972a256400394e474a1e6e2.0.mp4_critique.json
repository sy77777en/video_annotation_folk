    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a coastal scenery shot and accurately follows the camera's movement from the beach to the open ocean, it relies too heavily on subjective adjectives and misses opportunities for more specific visual detail. The instructions state to avoid emotional or subjective terms, but the caption uses words like \"gentle,\" \"vast,\" \"calm,\" and \"tranquil.\" Based on my viewing, a more objective description would be to describe the waves as \"low, slow-rolling waves that create thin lines of white foam as they reach the shore.\" The description of the sand as a \"wide, flat expanse of brown sand\" is too general; the video clearly shows the sand is dark and damp near the water, creating a reflective surface, and is a lighter tan color further up the beach. Additionally, the final two sentences are overly analytical, explaining the \"shot's purpose\" and what the \"focus is deliberately placed on,\" which is interpretive rather than descriptive. A more concise and direct explanation would be better. The caption also fails to mention the subtle but visible texture on the ocean's surface, which appears as a pattern of small ripples, or the distinct, soft horizon line where the grey-blue water meets the base of the low-hanging clouds.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a coastal scene starting with a wide, flat expanse of dark, damp sand near the water, which reflects the sky, transitioning to a lighter tan color further up the beach. The camera glides over low, slow-rolling waves that create thin lines of white foam as they reach the shore, moving out across the grey-blue ocean. The ocean's surface features a subtle pattern of small ripples, leading to a soft horizon line where the water meets the base of large, low-hanging white and grey clouds, with patches of blue sky visible between them.",
