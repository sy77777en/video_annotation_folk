    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a hand holding a screwdriver, which is initially blurred, and a platform that is partially clear. The hand, with a light skin tone, becomes visible as it grips the screwdriver, a tool with a metallic shaft and a dark handle. The hand places a small, metallic nail on the platform, which has a rough, textured surface. The nail is positioned in the lower-left corner of the frame. After placing the nail, the hand moves out of the frame, leaving the nail standing upright on the platform. The focus shifts from the blurred screwdriver to the clear view of the nail, emphasizing the action of placing it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a hand holding a screwdriver and placing a nail on a platform. Initially, only the screwdriver is blurred in the frame, with part of the platform clear. The hand then becomes visible in a close-up, holding the screwdriver. After placing the nail in the lower-left corner of the frame, the hand moves out of the frame.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (a hand, a screwdriver, a nail, a platform) and their visual attributes (light skin tone, metallic shaft, dark handle, rough texture). It also accurately describes the sequence of actions: the hand placing the nail and then moving away, and the corresponding shift in focus.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is complete. It captures all the salient subjects and the primary action that occurs in the video, providing enough detail for a reader to visualize the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation of Negative Constraints:** The most significant failure is the violation of the rule: \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption uses the word \"frame\" twice (\"lower-left corner of the frame\" and \"hand moves out of the frame\"). This is a direct breach of a specific negative constraint.\n*   **Conciseness and Flow:** The caption is not as concise as it could be. The sentence structure is somewhat repetitive (e.g., \"The hand... The hand places...\"). The final sentence, \"The focus shifts from the blurred screwdriver to the clear view of the nail, emphasizing the action of placing it,\" is also problematic. While it describes the focus shift, the phrase \"emphasizing the action of placing it\" is an interpretation of the director's intent rather than a simple description of what is visible.\n*   **Natural Language:** While the language is simple, the repetition and the slightly interpretive final sentence make it feel less natural and more like a technical analysis than a fluid description.\n\nIn summary, while the caption is factually accurate and complete, its failure to adhere to the strict negative constraint of avoiding the word \"frame\" and its slightly interpretive and repetitive phrasing make it a poor caption according to the provided instructions.",
