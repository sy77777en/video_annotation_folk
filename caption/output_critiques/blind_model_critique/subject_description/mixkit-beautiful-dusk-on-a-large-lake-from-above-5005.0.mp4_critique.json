    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial landscape scenery shot capturing a vast, tranquil body of water surrounded by a dramatic range of mountains. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of a low sun, which peeks over the silhouetted peaks and casts ethereal sunbeams through a thick layer of mist, reflecting softly on the calm, greenish-teal water below. Small, tree-covered islands are scattered across the water, adding to the serene and expansive vista. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the immense scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment. The shot is intended to immerse the viewer in the serene, misty mood created by the interplay of light, water, and mountains, rather than drawing attention to a specific object or landform. The landscape itself, in its entirety, serves as the subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the overall scene, it could be improved by adhering more strictly to objectivity and adding more specific visual detail. The description relies on subjective, mood-setting words like \"tranquil,\" \"dramatic,\" and \"ethereal,\" which the instructions advise against. Instead of stating the scene is \"serene,\" the caption could achieve this effect by describing the water's surface more precisely, for example, as \"a glassy, mirror-like surface with faint, slow-moving ripples.\" The description of the mountains as a \"dramatic range\" is also subjective; it would be more informative to describe their physical form, such as having \"sharp, craggy peaks\" or \"steep, forested slopes descending directly into the water.\" Furthermore, the caption could clarify the nature of the \"sunbeams,\" specifying if they are distinct, sharp rays cutting through the mist or a more diffuse, hazy glow. Lastly, the explanation for why there is no main subject is slightly repetitive; the three sentences could be condensed into one or two for better conciseness while still conveying that the focus is on the scale and atmosphere of the environment itself.",
