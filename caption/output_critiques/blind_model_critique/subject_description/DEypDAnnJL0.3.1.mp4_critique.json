    "pre_caption": "This over-the-shoulder shot features a person with light skin and dark, curly hair, seen from behind and out of focus in the right foreground. Only the back of their head and their bare right shoulder are visible. The focus is on a white tiled wall in the background, which has a smiley face on it. The face is composed of numerous small, dark, circular marks, with dark liquid dripping down from the curved line of the mouth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video, shot from a third-person over-the-shoulder POV, features a smiley face pattern on what seems to be a bathroom wall. The person appears blurry in the foreground, occupying only 30% of the frame's width on the right side, with part of their shoulder and half of their head visible.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects—the person in the foreground and the smiley face on the wall—it misses several key visual details that would be apparent in a video. The description of the person's hair as just \"dark, curly\" is too general; in the video, the hair is short, matted, and appears damp, suggesting a humid or wet environment like a bathroom. The caption also fails to mention the state of the wall's grout, which is visibly dark with grime and mildew, contrasting sharply with the white tiles and reinforcing the unsettling nature of the scene. The most significant omission is the description of the \"dripping\" liquid. The caption implies a static image, but the video clearly shows a thick, black, tar-like substance actively and slowly oozing from the mouth of the smiley face, with one droplet elongating and trembling before falling. Furthermore, the \"small, dark, circular marks\" are not uniform; they are irregularly shaped splotches of what appears to be black mold, clustered densely for the eyes and scattered more loosely for the mouth, making the face look more like a natural formation of decay than a deliberate drawing. A more accurate caption would specify these dynamic and textural details to better convey the video's content and eerie atmosphere.",
