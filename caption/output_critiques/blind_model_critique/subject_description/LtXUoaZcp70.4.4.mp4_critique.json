    "pre_caption": "The main subject of the video is a blue, porous-textured statue of a man in a military uniform, positioned centrally behind a table-like surface. The statue has a complex, lattice-like appearance and is rendered entirely in a vibrant blue. The man is depicted wearing a high-collared jacket with epaulets and has a distinct eyepatch over his right eye. He stands with a serious expression, his left hand resting on the surface in front of him. He is surrounded by other figures of a similar style and color. One such figure is partially visible to his left, while the out-of-focus shoulders of two others frame the shot from the foreground, suggesting a group gathering.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the central subject's unique blue, lattice-like texture and military attire, it could be improved with greater precision and by incorporating elements of motion. The term \"statue\" might be misleading; if the video presents them as digital creations, \"3D models\" or \"digital figures\" would be more accurate. The description of a \"serious expression\" is subjective and should be replaced with an objective description of the facial features, such as \"a neutral expression with a downturned mouth.\" The caption also misses key details that would be visible in the video, such as the pose of the man's right hand, which is clenched in a fist at his side, and a more specific description of the \"table-like surface\" as a dark, reflective plane that contrasts with the figures. Furthermore, the description of the surrounding figures is too general; the video clearly shows the figure to the left is a woman in a similar uniform and the one to the right is looking slightly away from the center. Most importantly, the caption describes a static scene, completely omitting the video's primary motion: a slow, deliberate camera push-in that starts wide on the group and gradually moves closer to the central figure, bringing the intricate details of his eyepatch and porous uniform into sharp focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a central 3D model of a man in a military uniform, rendered in a vibrant blue with a porous, lattice-like texture. He stands behind a dark, reflective plane, his left hand resting on it while his right hand is clenched in a fist at his side. The man wears a high-collared jacket with epaulets and an eyepatch over his right eye, displaying a neutral expression with a downturned mouth. Surrounding him are other digital figures in similar styles and colors: a woman in a matching uniform to his left and another figure to the right, slightly turned away. The scene is dynamic, with a slow, deliberate camera push-in that starts wide on the group and gradually moves closer to the central figure, highlighting the intricate details of his eyepatch and uniform.",
