    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit, top-down scene, several stylized humanoid figures are depicted on a dark blue surface splattered with red. The most prominent figures are clad in brown and tan attire and are distinguished by large, white, crescent-shaped horns or headpieces. Among them is a small, dark figure in a red cloak holding a glowing red sword. A floating, purple, squid-like creature with tentacles is also visible. The scene contains a bright blue, glowing projectile leaving a white smoke trail, and at one point, a large, glowing red crescent shape materializes on the ground. White, rock-like fragments are scattered across the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"stylized humanoid figures\" and a \"squid-like creature,\" which is an appropriate and precise way to describe non-realistic characters. The visual details are also spot-on, such as the \"dark blue surface splattered with red,\" the \"brown and tan attire,\" the \"white, crescent-shaped horns or headpieces,\" the \"glowing red sword,\" and the \"bright blue, glowing projectile.\" The description of dynamic events, like the projectile's smoke trail and the materializing red crescent, accurately captures the action.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive without being overly long. It successfully captures all the key subjects and elements in the scene. It starts with the most prominent figures, moves to a distinct secondary figure (the one with the red cloak), includes the non-humanoid creature, and finishes by describing important environmental effects and objects. This creates a complete and well-rounded picture of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to read while being packed with essential information.\n*   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** The entire description is focused on identifying subjects and detailing their specific visual characteristics (color, shape, attire, items they hold).\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole, mentioning an event that happens \"at one point,\" successfully summarizing the video's content over time without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types (\"humanoid figures,\" \"creature,\" \"projectile\") instead of vague terms.\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is descriptive and neutral, avoiding subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the different figures by their appearance (\"prominent figures\" with horns, \"small, dark figure in a red cloak\") and prioritizes them logically.\n*   **Handling Ambiguity:** The use of terms like \"humanoid,\" \"squid-like,\" and \"horns or headpieces\" shows excellent judgment in describing stylized or ambiguous subjects without making unverified claims.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is clear, accurate, and detailed, providing a perfect description of the video's visual content.",
