    "pre_caption": "The video features a static, eye-level shot of a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk sideways to the right, passing the camera one by one. Each large camel is only partially visible, with half of their bodies captured at a time, first showing their right side and then their left as they move across the frame. The smaller white camel, however, is fully visible within the frame. The camels are distinguished by their size and color, with the larger ones being black and the smaller one white, creating a contrast against the sandy desert backdrop.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a static, eye-level shot of a desert scene where five large black camels and a smaller white camel walk sideways to the right, passing the camera one by one. The frame only captures half of each large camel's body at a time, first their right side and then their left side as they move across. However, the smaller white camel's entire body fits within the frame.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good attempt at a caption, but it has some significant flaws in accuracy and adherence to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Good:** The caption is accurate in identifying the subjects as \"five large black camels and a smaller white camel.\" It correctly notes their distinguishing features (size and color) and the general action (passing the camera one by one).\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The description of the movement is inaccurate and confusing.\n    *   Camels do not \"walk sideways.\" A more accurate description would be \"walk from left to right\" or \"move across the scene.\"\n    *   The phrase \"first showing their right side and then their left as they move across the frame\" is illogical. If an animal is walking from left to right, the viewer would see its left side. The description is contradictory and physically incorrect.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is very complete. It successfully captures the number of subjects, their key attributes, their action, the framing (partially vs. fully visible), and the necessary context (desert scene) without adding unnecessary details.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly uses precise subject types (\"camels\").\n    *   It avoids subjective adjectives.\n    *   It successfully distinguishes between the multiple subjects (\"large black camels,\" \"smaller white camel\").\n    *   It correctly mentions the background (\"desert backdrop\") only to provide necessary context and explain the visual contrast, which is an appropriate use.\n\n*   **Violations:**\n    *   **Major Violation:** The instruction explicitly states, \"**avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.**\" The caption violates this rule twice by using the word \"frame\" (\"move across the frame,\" \"fully visible within the frame\").\n    *   **Minor Violation:** The instruction asks for a description of the video, not a description *of the video as a technical object*. Starting with \"The video features a static, eye-level shot...\" is overly technical. While \"static\" is a useful detail, the phrase \"The video features\" and \"shot\" are meta-commentary. A better approach is to describe the scene directly.\n    *   **Clarity and Natural Language:** The inaccurate description of motion (\"walk sideways,\" \"right side and then their left\") violates the rule to use \"simple, natural English\" and ensure the description is \"clear.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good at identifying the core subjects and their attributes but fails on key instructions. The inaccurate description of motion makes it confusing, and the use of the forbidden word \"frame\" is a direct violation of the rules. To be a good caption, it needs to correct the description of movement and remove the forbidden and overly technical terms.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a desert scene, five large black camels and a smaller white camel move from left to right, passing by one by one. The larger camels are partially visible, showing only one side at a time, while the smaller white camel is fully visible. The contrast between the black and white camels against the sandy backdrop is striking.",
