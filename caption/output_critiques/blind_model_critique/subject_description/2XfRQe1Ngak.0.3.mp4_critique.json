    "pre_caption": "A person is shown from a back-facing, point-of-view perspective while kayaking. This individual wears a red, long-sleeved waterproof jacket, a black and green life vest with \"YAKIMA\" printed on the back, and a black helmet featuring a red and white \"Teva\" logo. They are holding a paddle with a black shaft and silver blades. In the distance ahead, another person in a red kayak and red attire is also visible navigating the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two kayakers and their basic attire, it misses several key visual elements that would be prominent in the video. The description of the perspective as \"back-facing, point-of-view\" is confusing; a more accurate term would be \"first-person perspective,\" as we would likely see the kayaker's arms and the front of their own vessel, not their back. The caption fails to mention the main subject's kayak at all, which, in my imagined view, is a bright blue and would be a significant part of the shot. Furthermore, the description completely omits the dynamic environment. The video likely shows them navigating turbulent whitewater rapids through a narrow, tree-lined canyon, and this action-filled setting is a crucial part of the scene, not just a passive background. Finally, while the second person is distant, the caption could specify their action more clearly, for instance, noting that they are paddling ahead through the same set of rapids, which would better establish the relationship and shared activity between the two subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a thrilling first-person perspective of a kayaker navigating turbulent whitewater rapids through a narrow, tree-lined canyon. The main subject, wearing a red long-sleeved waterproof jacket, a black and green life vest with \"YAKIMA\" printed on the back, and a black helmet with a red and white \"Teva\" logo, is seen paddling a bright blue kayak. The paddle has a black shaft and silver blades, and the kayaker's arms and the front of their vessel are visible in the shot. In the distance, another person in a red kayak and matching attire is paddling ahead through the same set of rapids, highlighting the shared adventure between the two kayakers.",
