    "pre_caption": "This video presents an industrial scenery shot of a unique, custom-built environment. The focus is on the impressive scale and creative design of the setting itself, rather than on a particular subject, showcasing a long stationary train transformed into a skatepark. The train consists of blue shipping containers, branded with Red Bull and Prada logos, sitting on tracks in a railyard next to another freight train with brown tanker cars. The tops of the blue containers are fitted with a continuous, light-tan-colored ramp system, featuring a step-up ramp leading to a higher section, followed by a step-down. A red animated arrow traces a potential path over these ramps. The scene is set on a clear, sunny day, with green trees and distant hills visible in the background, while a person in an orange safety vest stands on the ground beside the train.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few clear violations of the instructions. It is strong in accuracy and completeness but fails on some key stylistic rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key subjects and their attributes:\n*   It accurately describes the main subject as a \"long stationary train transformed into a skatepark.\"\n*   It correctly identifies the components as \"blue shipping containers\" and notes the \"Red Bull and Prada logos.\"\n*   It accurately describes the adjacent train as having \"brown tanker cars.\"\n*   The description of the \"light-tan-colored ramp system\" with its \"step-up\" and \"step-down\" features is precise.\n*   It correctly identifies the \"red animated arrow\" and its function of tracing a path.\n*   It accurately notes the presence of a \"person in an orange safety vest.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete and provides a comprehensive overview of the scene. It successfully captures the primary focus (the custom-built skatepark) while also including important secondary elements (the other train, the person, the animated graphic) that give a full picture of the video's content. It effectively combines details from across the video into a single, holistic description.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has some issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text (besides the one phrase noted below).\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"scenery shot\" and follows the specific instruction to explain why the focus is on the environment (\"The focus is on the impressive scale and creative design of the setting itself, rather than on a particular subject\").\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"shipping containers,\" \"tanker cars,\" and \"person\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Prioritization:** It correctly prioritizes the main subject (the skatepark train) before moving to less prominent ones.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses **\"impressive\"** and **\"creative,\"** which are subjective judgments about the quality of the design. This is a direct violation.\n*   **Unnecessary Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"This video presents...\". The instructions call for a direct description of the subjects within the video, not a description of the video as a presentation. A more compliant start would be, \"An industrial scenery shot shows a unique, custom-built environment...\"\n*   **Mentioning the Background:** The instruction says, \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary.\" The caption mentions \"green trees and distant hills visible in the background.\" While the scenery shot rule allows for describing the environment, these details are not essential for understanding the primary subjects and could be omitted for stricter adherence to the main rule.",
