    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, mostly complete, and adheres well to the majority of the instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It provides specific, verifiable details about the subject and her actions:\n*   **Subject:** \"A young woman\"\n*   **Attributes:** \"blonde hair pulled back,\" \"wearing a white t-shirt\"\n*   **Pose/Action:** \"lying in bed, propped up against a pillow,\" \"holds a black tablet computer, looking down at its screen\"\n*   **Facial Expression:** \"a slight smile\"\n\nThese descriptions are objective and paint a clear picture of the scene.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the main subject, her key visual characteristics, her pose, and the primary object she is interacting with. It provides enough detail for a reader to visualize the scene without being overly verbose. The only potential omission is the woman's skin tone, but the instructions state to only include details that are clear, so its absence is acceptable and likely follows the rules.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"woman,\" \"tablet computer\") instead of vague ones.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives. The phrase \"a slight smile\" is an excellent example of correctly describing a facial expression (as requested) rather than inferring an emotion (like \"happy\").\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the main subject and the object she is interacting with.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n\n*   **Minor Deviation:**\n    *   The caption mentions the background lighting: \"The scene is dimly lit with a cool, blue-toned light.\" The instructions state, \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" In this case, the lighting describes the atmosphere rather than helping to distinguish the woman. While this is a minor deviation, it adds valuable context to the scene and does not detract from the caption's primary focus on the subject. It's a judgment call, and in this instance, it improves the overall description.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by being descriptive, objective, and well-structured. The minor deviation regarding the background lighting is justifiable as it enhances the description without violating the core principles of the prompt.",
