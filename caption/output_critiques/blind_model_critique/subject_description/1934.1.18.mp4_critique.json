    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of five individuals, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of the individuals, distinguishable by a red top hat, stands slightly apart and appears taller than the others. The screen they are observing displays a small, white silhouette of a person. The individuals are closely focused on the screen, suggesting an interest or engagement with the content displayed. The scene conveys a sense of uniformity and attention among the group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw regarding adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the number of subjects (\"a group of five individuals\"), their attire (\"white protective suits with hoods\"), the key distinguishing feature of one subject (\"a red top hat\"), and the object of their focus (\"a screen... displays a small, white silhouette of a person\"). The observation that the individual with the hat \"appears taller\" is also an accurate description of a visual attribute.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the essential subjects and their most important visual details in a concise manner. It correctly focuses on the group and the screen, which are the most salient elements, and provides enough detail (suits, hat, silhouette) for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene. It appropriately omits details that are likely obscured by the suits, such as facial features or hair.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions well, but it fails on one critical point.\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is clear, concise, and uses simple, natural English.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"individuals,\" \"screen\") and avoids vague words.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It describes key visual attributes like clothing color and style (\"white protective suits with hoods\") and unique features (\"red top hat\").\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes one individual from the group using a unique visual trait.\n*   **Avoiding Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Weakness (Where the caption fails):**\n*   **Subjectivity and Interpretation:** The main issue is the violation of the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions**\" and \"**avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\"\n    *   The phrase \"**suggesting an interest or engagement**\" is an interpretation of the subjects' internal mental state, not a direct visual observation. A more objective description would be to state that they are all facing and looking at the screen.\n    *   Similarly, the final sentence, \"**The scene conveys a sense of uniformity and attention among the group**,\" is a subjective summary of the scene's mood and the subjects' mental focus (\"attention\"). While \"uniformity\" is based on a visual fact (the suits), \"sense of attention\" is an inference.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is good because it is accurate, complete, and follows most of the structural and descriptive rules. However, it is not a *perfect* caption according to the strict instructions because it includes subjective interpretations about the subjects' mental states (\"interest,\" \"engagement,\" \"attention\"). To be fully compliant, it should have described only the observable actions and appearances.",
