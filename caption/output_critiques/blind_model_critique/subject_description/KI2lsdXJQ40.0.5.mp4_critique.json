    "pre_caption": "The video features a small, rectangular suitcase with a hard shell and a handle, shown open to reveal its contents. Inside the suitcase, there is a neatly folded long-sleeve shirt with a red base color and white polka dots, as well as several rolled-up pieces of clothing in light colors, such as white and gray. The shirt is positioned on one side of the suitcase, while the rolled clothing items are arranged beside it. The suitcase and its contents are viewed from above, and the shirt’s collar and buttons are clearly visible, making it the most visually prominent item among the packed clothing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It is accurate, complete, and adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption provides a precise and factual description of the subjects. It details the type of suitcase (\"small, rectangular... with a hard shell\"), its state (\"open\"), and its contents (\"long-sleeve shirt,\" \"rolled-up pieces of clothing\"). The specific visual attributes, such as the shirt's \"red base color and white polka dots,\" are clear and verifiable.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is thorough. It not only identifies the subjects but also describes their arrangement (\"positioned on one side,\" \"arranged beside it\"), their state (\"neatly folded,\" \"rolled-up\"), and the overall perspective (\"viewed from above\"). It successfully captures all the essential visual information in the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that gets straight to the point without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** It correctly focuses on the suitcase and the clothing, describing their types and visual characteristics in detail as instructed.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using \"image\" or \"frame\" and describes the scene holistically.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The language is descriptive and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. \"Neatly folded\" is an acceptable descriptor of the clothing's state.\n    *   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses clear and specific terms like \"suitcase\" and \"long-sleeve shirt.\"\n    *   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It correctly prioritizes the subjects, starting with the container (suitcase), then describing the most prominent item (the polka-dot shirt), and finally the other items (rolled clothing). This creates a logical and easy-to-follow description.\n    *   **Format:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any extra formatting or introductory text.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the instructions. It is clear, detailed, and objective, providing an excellent description of the video's content.",
