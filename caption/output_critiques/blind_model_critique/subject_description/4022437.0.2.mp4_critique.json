    "pre_caption": "The video shows a close-up of the rear passenger side of a black car with a glossy finish. The rear passenger door is open, revealing a tan leather interior, specifically the back of a front seat which has a storage pocket. A large, silver, five-spoke alloy wheel is prominently featured, with a Mercedes-Benz logo in the center cap and \"AMG\" lettering visible on one of the thick, slightly angular spokes. The black rubber tire has visible sidewall lettering, including \"CONTINENTAL,\" and a silver brake disc with a darker brake caliper can be seen behind the wheel spokes. Part of the car's roof, including a sunroof, is also visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by correctly identifying the car and its key static features, but it overlooks several crucial visual and dynamic elements from the video. For instance, it fails to mention the slow, deliberate camera pan that starts on the silver brake caliper, which is actually a vibrant red with white \"AMG\" lettering, a detail missed in the description that also incorrectly places the lettering on the wheel spoke. As the camera pulls back, it reveals the wheel is slowly rotating, causing studio lights to glint off the polished silver spokes and the glossy black bodywork, creating distinct moving reflections not mentioned in the text. Furthermore, while the tan leather interior is noted, the video clearly shows a glowing blue ambient light strip along the interior door panel and a black, branded umbrella neatly tucked into the seat's storage pocket. The description of the sunroof is also too general; the video concludes with a tilt up to a panoramic glass roof, showing the reflection of the studio ceiling moving across its surface, which is a key part of the shot's composition.",
