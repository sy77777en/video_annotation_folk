    "pre_caption": "The video is shot from a first-person perspective, showing movement through an indoor hallway. In the bottom right corner, a hand-drawn cartoon character on a white paper cutout, attached to a light brown wooden stick, is consistently visible. This character features a round head with messy, outlined hair, a small bow on the right side of its hair, two dot eyes, a simple curved line for a mouth, and a basic body outline. The hallway is characterized by light pink walls, white wainscoting, a deep red carpet, and is lit by wall-mounted lamps with cream-colored shades; framed landscape pictures are also seen on the walls as the view progresses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video is shot from a first-person perspective, showing a wide shot of an indoor hallway. In the bottom right corner, there is an added sticker with a simple cartoon character drawn on a piece of paper throughout the video.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by accurately identifying the first-person perspective and the key subjects—the cartoon cutout and the hallway. However, it misses the dynamic interplay and narrative elements that seem central to the video. For instance, the caption describes the cartoon character as \"consistently visible\" but fails to mention that the hand holding the stick makes the character bob and tilt, seemingly reacting to the environment by \"looking\" at the framed pictures as the camera passes them. The description of the hallway, while listing colors and features, is too clinical and misses the specific visual style; the \"light pink\" walls appear faded and slightly peeling in the dim, warm light of the lamps, and the \"deep red carpet\" is visibly worn, suggesting the hallway is part of an older, perhaps neglected, building rather than a modern one. Furthermore, the caption's description of the end of the hallway is incomplete. It correctly notes the niche and doorways, but it omits the crucial final action of the video: the perspective slows, and the hand angles the cartoon character towards the open doorway on the left, pausing for a moment as if contemplating entry before the video abruptly ends. Including the character's subtle movements and the more specific, atmospheric details of the hallway's condition would more fully capture the video's narrative and tone.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is shot from a first-person perspective, capturing a journey through an indoor hallway. In the bottom right corner, a hand-drawn cartoon character on a white paper cutout, attached to a light brown wooden stick, is not just consistently visible but actively engaged. The character, with its round head, messy outlined hair, small bow, dot eyes, simple curved mouth, and basic body outline, bobs and tilts as if reacting to the environment, \"looking\" at the framed landscape pictures as the camera passes them. The hallway, with its faded, slightly peeling light pink walls and visibly worn deep red carpet, is illuminated by wall-mounted lamps with cream-colored shades, casting a dim, warm glow that suggests an older, perhaps neglected building. As the perspective progresses, the end of the hallway reveals a niche and doorways. The movement slows, and the hand angles the cartoon character towards the open doorway on the left, pausing momentarily as if contemplating entry before the video abruptly ends, adding a narrative element to the scene.",
