    "pre_caption": "The video features a Porsche car with a distinctive split-color livery. The driver's side of the car is blue, and the passenger's side is red, with a white stripe running down the center of the hood and roof. On the blue side of the hood, a large white circle contains the text \"-30°\" in blue. Correspondingly, the red side features a white circle with \"+30°\" in red text. The word \"PORSCHE\" is written in white capital letters across the top of the windshield. A hashtag, \"#Drive2Extremes,\" is visible in white on the blue side of the car. The vehicle's German license plate reads \"S·VG 1015E\". The car is shown from various angles, including a top-down view, a front view, and side views.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The shot begins with a medium shot of the front section of a Porsche from the side. The camera then moves backward to reveal a full front view of the car, before circling to the opposite side and transitioning back into a medium shot. Finally, it transitions to a full shot of the car, filmed from its right rear side.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately details the car's distinctive livery and markings, it fails to capture the likely dynamic nature and narrative of the video. Imagining the content, the car is probably not static but is shown in motion, driving through two contrasting extreme environments to match the \"+30°\" and \"-30°\" theme—for instance, a sun-scorched desert and a frozen, snowy landscape. The description misses this crucial action and context, which is central to the \"#Drive2Extremes\" concept. The caption could also be more specific by identifying the Porsche model, which appears to be a Taycan based on its modern design and the \"E\" on the license plate suggesting it's electric. Additionally, the description mentions a \"driver's side\" but neglects to state whether a driver is visible inside the vehicle; if a person is shown, they should be described as a secondary subject. Finally, the description of the hood markings could be more concise by combining the details into a single, more fluid sentence rather than two separate ones.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a Porsche Taycan with a striking split-color livery, dynamically navigating through two contrasting extreme environments—a sun-scorched desert and a frozen, snowy landscape—embodying the \"+30°\" and \"-30°\" theme.
