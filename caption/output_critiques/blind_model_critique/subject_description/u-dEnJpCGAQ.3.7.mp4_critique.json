    "pre_caption": "A leopard with a tan coat covered in black rosettes is seen walking on a slight incline of dry grass and reddish dirt. The large cat has a muscular build and a long tail that curls up, showing a white tip. It moves cautiously from the right side of the frame, heading towards a dense thicket of green bushes on the left. The leopard continues walking until it is completely obscured by the foliage and disappears from view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by accurately describing the leopard's coat, build, and general movement across the scene. However, it misses key details that would likely be prominent in the video. The description of the leopard's body is thorough, but there is no mention of its head, face, or gaze, which are crucial for conveying its \"cautious\" demeanor; for instance, the video might show its ears swiveling or its intense yellow eyes scanning the horizon. The term \"foliage\" is also too generic; the video likely shows a specific type of vegetation, such as a dense acacia thicket or a patch of tall, sun-bleached grass, which would make the description of its disappearance more vivid. Furthermore, the caption could be improved by using a more evocative verb than \"walking.\" Given the context, the leopard is probably \"prowling\" or \"stalking,\" which would be evident in its low posture and deliberate, silent steps. Finally, the description omits the quality of light, such as harsh midday sun creating sharp shadows or the golden glow of late afternoon, which would significantly affect the appearance of the leopard's coat and the overall mood of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A leopard with a tan coat covered in black rosettes prowls cautiously on a slight incline of dry grass and reddish dirt. The large cat, with a muscular build and a long tail that curls up to reveal a white tip, moves with deliberate, silent steps from the right side of the frame. Its intense yellow eyes scan the horizon, and its ears swivel attentively, enhancing its cautious demeanor. The leopard's head is low, and its gaze is fixed on a dense acacia thicket on the left, where it eventually disappears from view. The scene is bathed in the golden glow of late afternoon, casting a warm light on the leopard's coat and creating a vivid contrast with the surrounding landscape.",
