    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it accurately identifies the main subject, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints and formatting rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is generally accurate in its description of the subject. It correctly identifies a man in a dark, bulky spacesuit with a helmet, a clear visor, and a backpack-like apparatus. The description of his orientation (\"sideways\") and expression (\"focused\") is also factually correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is reasonably complete in describing the suit. However, it is incomplete in describing the man himself. The instructions ask for details like skin tone, hairstyle, and age (if discernible), which are omitted. The caption focuses more on the attire than the person wearing it.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues. It violates several explicit rules:\n\n1.  **Use of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is an introductory phrase. The instructions explicitly state to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n\n2.  **Speculation and Inference:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption violates this rule multiple times:\n    *   \"...**suggesting** space exploration or a similar environment.\" This is an inference about the context, not a direct visual description of the subject.\n    *   \"...**possibly** maneuvering or inspecting something.\" The word \"possibly\" indicates uncertainty, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   \"...**emphasizing the technical and protective nature** of his attire.\" This is a subjective interpretation of the lighting's effect, not a description of a visual attribute of the subject.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Subject:** While the caption focuses on the man, the final sentence shifts focus to the lighting and its effect (\"The lighting highlights... emphasizing...\"). The instructions require focusing on subject types and their visual attributes. A better approach would be to describe the visual attributes of the suit that are made visible by the light (e.g., \"The suit has a glossy texture that reflects light along its contours\").\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it includes forbidden introductory text, engages in speculation instead of sticking to direct visual evidence, and uses subjective, interpretive language. A good caption would have started directly with the subject's description and only included observable facts.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man in a dark, bulky spacesuit with a clear visor helmet is visible, showing a focused expression. His face, with light skin tone and short hair, suggests he is middle-aged. The suit includes a backpack-like apparatus, and he is oriented sideways in a confined space. The lighting reveals the glossy texture of the suit, highlighting its contours and protective features.",
