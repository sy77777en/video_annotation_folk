    "pre_caption": "The video features a pixelated, dark blue cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents resembling vines or water streams. The main subject is a small, white, circular character with a simple design, possibly an eye or a face, navigating through the scene. This character moves vertically and horizontally, interacting with the environment. The setting includes platforms and walls with a digital, grid-like texture, creating a maze-like structure. The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of retro video games, with a focus on exploration and movement within the confined space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions, primarily regarding subject focus, prioritization, and conciseness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the pixelated, retro-game style, the colors (dark blue, turquoise, white), and the shapes and actions of the elements (\"small, white, circular character,\" \"moves vertically and horizontally,\" \"maze-like structure\"). The use of cautious language like \"possibly an eye or a face\" and \"resembling vines\" is appropriate for ambiguous features.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete, perhaps overly so. It captures the main subject, its actions, and the detailed characteristics of the environment. No major visual element seems to be missing.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n1.  **Incorrect Prioritization:** The instructions state to prioritize subjects by relevance, \"starting with the largest or most centered subject\" or the \"most visually striking or important subject.\" The caption begins by describing the \"pixelated, dark blue cave-like environment\" in detail before mentioning the main subject, the \"white, circular character.\" The character is the primary subject, and the description should have started with it.\n\n2.  **Excessive Focus on Background:** The instructions explicitly state, \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The caption dedicates almost half of its content to describing the environment, which is not the main subject. Phrases like \"pixelated, dark blue cave-like environment with glowing turquoise accents\" and \"platforms and walls with a digital, grid-like texture, creating a maze-like structure\" are too detailed and shift the focus away from the subject itself.\n\n3.  **Use of Subjective/Interpretive Language:** The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives.\" The final sentence, \"The overall aesthetic is reminiscent of retro video games, with a focus on exploration and movement within the confined space,\" is an interpretive summary of the video's genre and theme. This goes beyond describing direct visual attributes and offers a subjective conclusion, which is forbidden.\n\n4.  **Lack of Conciseness:** The instructions call for a \"concise yet informative description.\" By including extensive background details and an interpretive final sentence, the caption becomes longer and less focused than required. The core information could be conveyed more efficiently by integrating the environmental context into the description of the subject's actions.",
