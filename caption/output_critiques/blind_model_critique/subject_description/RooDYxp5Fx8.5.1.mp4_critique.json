    "pre_caption": "This video captures a bright and tranquil cityscape scenery shot from a sidewalk in a Japanese city. The scene unfolds along a wide, paved sidewalk next to a multi-lane road with light traffic, including a silver van parked at the curb. A woman with dark hair, wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, walks away from the camera. The street is lined with modern buildings of varying heights, one of which features a prominent white sign with the \"SOMPO\" logo. In the distance, lush green mountains are visible under a brilliant blue sky filled with scattered white clouds, adding a natural element to the urban landscape. There is no main subject; the camera's static, wide perspective emphasizes the overall environment and peaceful atmosphere of the city on a sunny day, rather than focusing on any single person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the overall scene as a Japanese cityscape, it misses several key visual details and misinterprets the focus of the video. The description of \"light traffic\" is too vague; in the video, a white city bus and a small red car are clearly seen moving from right to left in the far lanes, which provides more specific context than just the parked silver van. The woman, while walking away, is carrying a beige canvas tote bag on her right shoulder and her dark hair is tied up in a neat bun, details that are omitted but make her a more distinct subject. Stating that there is \"no main subject\" is a mischaracterization; although the shot is wide, the woman's movement makes her a primary point of interest. The caption should describe her as a salient subject within the larger environment without the concluding, and contradictory, analytical sentence. Furthermore, the description of the sidewalk is incomplete, as it fails to mention a prominent, bright red public mailbox and a blue vending machine visible near the curb, both of which are characteristic elements of the setting. Lastly, the use of subjective words like \"bright,\" \"tranquil,\" \"brilliant,\" and \"peaceful\" should be replaced with more objective descriptions; for instance, instead of a \"brilliant blue sky,\" it could be described as \"a clear, uniformly blue sky,\" which adheres more closely to the instruction to avoid conveying emotion.",
