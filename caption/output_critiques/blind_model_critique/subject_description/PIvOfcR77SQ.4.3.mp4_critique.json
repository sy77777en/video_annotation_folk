    "pre_caption": "The video features a snowy landscape with tall evergreen trees lining the sides of a snow-covered path. In the foreground, a person is seen operating a sled or similar vehicle. The person is wearing a dark jacket, and their hand is visible on the steering mechanism, which is black with a circular design. The sled has a metallic frame and a visible logo. The scene conveys a sense of movement along the snowy path, with the tracks in the snow indicating the direction of travel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\nThe caption is moderately good but has several clear violations of the provided instructions regarding subjectivity, the description of motion, and the level of detail.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **High:** The caption appears to accurately describe the content of the video. It correctly identifies the main subjects (a person, a sled/vehicle) and the setting (a snowy path with evergreen trees). The described details, such as the dark jacket, the black steering mechanism, and the sled's metallic frame, seem plausible and specific.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Moderate:** The caption is incomplete in its description of the primary subject.\n    *   The instructions require a detailed description of people, including gender, age, hairstyle, etc., if discernible. The caption only identifies a \"person\" wearing a \"dark jacket.\" It fails to provide any other potential visual attributes, which makes the description feel generic.\n    *   While it describes the sled and steering mechanism well, the lack of detail about the human subject is a significant omission.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is the area with the most significant issues. The caption fails to follow several key negative constraints.\n\n*   **Violation 1 (Major): Describing Motion and Interpretation.** The instruction states: \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The final sentence, \"The scene conveys a sense of movement along the snowy path, with the tracks in the snow indicating the direction of travel,\" directly violates this rule. The motion is not necessary to distinguish the subject, which is already identified as \"a person... operating a sled.\"\n*   **Violation 2 (Major): Using Subjective/Interpretive Language.** The instruction states: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The phrase **\"conveys a sense of movement\"** is an interpretation of the scene's effect on the viewer, not a direct, objective description of the subjects. A better approach would be to describe the action directly (e.g., \"A person operates a sled...\").\n*   **Violation 3 (Minor): Unnecessary Background Description.** The caption begins by describing the \"snowy landscape with tall evergreen trees.\" While this provides context, the instructions prioritize focusing on salient subjects and avoiding background details unless essential. A more compliant caption would integrate the setting into the description of the subject's action, rather than presenting it as a separate introductory clause.\n*   **Violation 4 (Minor): Use of Introductory Phrase.** The caption starts with \"The video features...\" The instructions ask for the description to be returned \"without... introductory text.\" The description should begin directly with the subject.\n\n### Improved Example Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more closely follows all the given instructions:\n\nA person wearing a dark jacket sits on a sled with a metallic frame and a visible logo, holding a black, circular steering mechanism. The sled is positioned on a snow-covered path that is lined with tall evergreen trees.",
