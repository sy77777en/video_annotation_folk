    "pre_caption": "The video features two distinct vehicles. Initially, a large black limousine is prominently displayed, characterized by its sleek design and shiny exterior. It has an American flag mounted on the front, indicating its official or ceremonial use. The limousine's windows are tinted, and it bears a distinctive emblem on the side, suggesting a high level of importance or security. As the video progresses, the focus transitions to a black SUV. This vehicle has a robust and sturdy appearance, with chrome wheels and visible roof-mounted equipment, possibly for communication or emergency purposes. The SUV's rear lights are uniquely designed with a red and white pattern. Both vehicles are moving along a city street, indicating a convoy or procession.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but has several key areas for improvement regarding its adherence to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the subjects. It correctly identifies a black limousine with an American flag and an emblem, followed by a black SUV with chrome wheels and roof-mounted equipment. The description of the vehicles' attributes is factually correct based on what is visible.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete. It successfully describes the two main subjects and their key visual features. However, it fails to describe the *type* of shot transition as required by the instruction: \"When shot transitions occur, describe the subject in each segment separately, noting the type of transition (e.g., hard cut, soft transition).\" The caption mentions \"the focus transitions\" but does not specify how (e.g., via a cut).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The most critical flaw is the repeated violation of the rule: \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption includes several inferences and speculations:\n    *   \"...indicating its official or ceremonial use.\" (This is an interpretation of the flag's purpose, not a visual description.)\n    *   \"...suggesting a high level of importance or security.\" (This is an interpretation of the emblem's meaning.)\n    *   \"...possibly for communication or emergency purposes.\" (The word \"possibly\" explicitly marks this as speculation, which is forbidden.)\n    *   \"...indicating a convoy or procession.\" (This is an interpretation of the vehicles' movement, not a direct observation.)\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction asks to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" While the adjectives used don't convey emotion, some are subjective interpretations of style rather than objective descriptions.\n    *   \"sleek design\" and \"robust and sturdy appearance\" are subjective. More objective alternatives would be \"a long body with a low profile\" or \"a large, boxy frame.\"\n\n*   **Introductory Sentence:** The caption begins with \"The video features two distinct vehicles.\" While not explicitly forbidden, the instructions imply a more direct start by stating to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A better approach would be to start describing the first subject directly.\n\n*   **Motion/Background:** The caption mentions the vehicles are \"moving along a city street.\" The instruction allows this if it's \"necessary to distinguish subjects by... action, or relationships.\" While it helps establish a relationship (convoy), the subsequent interpretation (\"indicating a convoy or procession\") is speculative and should have been omitted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the caption successfully identifies the subjects and many of their visual attributes in a clear paragraph, it fails on the critical instruction to avoid speculation and interpretation. It also misses a required detail about the shot transition type and uses some subjective language. To be considered a good caption according to the rules, it would need to be rewritten to state only what is visually present, omitting all inferences about purpose, meaning, or possibility.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large black limousine with a long body and low profile is prominently displayed, featuring an American flag mounted on the front, tinted windows, and a distinctive emblem on the side.
