    "pre_caption": "A close-up, side-profile view shows a faceless mannequin head. The head is made of a smooth, matte, pale white material and is completely devoid of any facial features such as eyes, a nose, or a mouth. It has neatly styled black hair, combed into a side part, with visible texture suggesting individual strands. At the base of the neck, the dark collar of a shirt is partially visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a faceless mannequin head and notes its material and hair, it omits several key visual dynamics and details present in the video. The description of a static \"three-quarter view\" is inaccurate; the video actually features a slow, continuous 180-degree pan that starts from a profile view and smoothly rotates around the front of the head, causing the light and shadows to shift across its featureless surface. The caption also fails to describe the dramatic, high-contrast lighting, where a strong key light from the left casts a sharp, dark shadow that moves across the right side of the head, emphasizing its smooth contours. Furthermore, the description of the \"dark collar\" is too vague; the video clearly shows it is a black, ribbed-knit turtleneck collar. Most significantly, the caption completely misses a key action: midway through the pan, a hand with pale skin and unpainted, neatly trimmed fingernails enters the frame from the bottom right to gently tuck a stray strand of the mannequin's hair behind its ear before retracting, introducing a secondary subject and a deliberate interaction that is central to the video's narrative.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up, side-profile view of a faceless mannequin head, crafted from a smooth, matte, pale white material, devoid of any facial features. The mannequin's neatly styled black hair, combed into a side part, displays visible texture with individual strands. As the camera executes a slow, continuous 180-degree pan from the profile to the front of the head, dramatic high-contrast lighting comes into play. A strong key light from the left casts a sharp, dark shadow that moves across the right side, accentuating the head's smooth contours. At the base of the neck, a black, ribbed-knit turtleneck collar is partially visible. Midway through the pan, a hand with pale skin and unpainted, neatly trimmed fingernails enters the frame from the bottom right, gently tucking a stray strand of hair behind the mannequin's ear before retracting, adding a deliberate interaction that enriches the video's narrative.",
