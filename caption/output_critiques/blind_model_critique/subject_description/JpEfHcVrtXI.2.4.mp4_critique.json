    "pre_caption": "This video is presented from the first-person perspective of a figure riding a vehicle, showing a pair of pale, stylized hands gripping white, curved handlebars against a dark, silhouetted body. In the distance, two other figures on what appear to be motorcycles are riding away from the viewer down a dark path. These figures are also rendered as dark silhouettes, with one having a red detail on its head. In the top left corner, a score is displayed in a stylized, glowing font with cyan and magenta numerals that change over time.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the first-person perspective and the color-shifting hands, but it omits crucial context and detail that define the video's aesthetic and action. The description of the hands as \"pale\" and \"stylized\" is too general; they are rendered in a flat, white, cel-shaded style with black outlines, giving them a distinct, animated quality. The caption completely neglects the environment, which is a critical element: the motorcycle is speeding through a dark, futuristic canyon, with the walls made of glowing, geometric, purple and blue light panels that pulse in time with an unseen beat. While the caption mentions a rider with a red helmet, it fails to note that all other motorcycles are similarly dark silhouettes, but they are distinguished by the vibrant, glowing neon trails they leave behind—the red-helmeted rider leaves a red trail, while others leave green and yellow trails. Furthermore, the \"score\" in the corner is more specifically a combination of a race position indicator (e.g., \"3/8\") and a lap timer, both rendered in the described glowing font. Lastly, the description lacks a sense of dynamism; it doesn't mention the visible motion blur at the edges of the view or the slight camera shake as the motorcycle lands after cresting a hill, both of which are key to conveying the intense speed of the race.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video immerses viewers in a high-speed, first-person perspective of a motorcycle race through a dark, futuristic canyon. The rider's hands, rendered in a flat, white, cel-shaded style with black outlines, grip the white, curved handlebars, adding an animated quality to the scene. The environment is a critical element, featuring glowing, geometric purple and blue light panels on the canyon walls that pulse rhythmically with an unseen beat. Ahead, two other riders, depicted as dark silhouettes, race down the path, each leaving vibrant neon trails—one with a red helmet leaves a red trail, while others leave green and yellow trails. The top left corner displays a dynamic race position indicator and lap timer in a stylized, glowing font with cyan and magenta numerals. The intense speed of the race is further conveyed through visible motion blur at the edges of the view and a slight camera shake as the motorcycle lands after cresting a hill.",
