    "pre_caption": "The video appears to be a first-person shooter game scene. The main subject is a player holding a black assault rifle with a digital display showing ammunition count and other data. The player navigates through an outdoor environment featuring a two-story building with a staircase on the exterior. The building is surrounded by trees and open space. On-screen graphics include a mini-map and player information, indicating a multiplayer setting. The player moves towards the building, suggesting an objective or exploration within the game.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a first-person shooter game but could be more specific and dynamic. The description of the rifle as \"sleek and modern\" is subjective; it would be more informative to detail its visible attachments, such as the red dot sight and suppressor that are clearly visible. The caption also omits a description of the player's hands and arms, which are a constant presence on screen; mentioning the black, fingerless tactical gloves they are wearing would add a key visual detail. The action is described simply as \"moves towards the building,\" which is too generic. In the video, the player sprints across the open field before slowing to a crouched, tactical walk as they near the staircase, and even performs a quick reload animation, details which are crucial to conveying the gameplay. Furthermore, while the caption mentions a multiplayer setting, it fails to note the most significant event: a brief glimpse of an enemy player moving past a second-story window, which is the clear motivation for the player's cautious approach. Finally, the description of the user interface is slightly redundant; it could be more concisely integrated by specifying the location and content of the elements, such as the mini-map in the top-left corner showing enemy indicators and the ammo count in the bottom-right.",
