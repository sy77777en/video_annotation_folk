The animal, which appears to be a red panda based on its distinctive coloration and tail, climbs along a large fallen branch and then continues moving until it disappears from view behind foliage and structures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It demonstrates a thorough understanding and near-perfect execution of the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate based on the details provided. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"medium-sized animal\" and then logically deduces it is a \"red panda\" based on classic visual attributes: \"reddish-brown fur, a long bushy tail, and a black face.\" The described actions—moving through a grassy area, climbing a branch, and disappearing behind foliage—are all typical behaviors for this animal, especially in a zoo or sanctuary setting, which the \"wooden structures\" might imply.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete and self-contained summary of the video's likely content. It covers:\n*   **The Subject:** A red panda.\n*   **Key Attributes:** Its distinctive coloration, fur, tail, and face are all mentioned.\n*   **The Environment:** It establishes the setting (\"grassy area with scattered plants and wooden structures\") just enough to contextualize the animal's actions.\n*   **The Narrative Arc:** It describes a full sequence of events from the animal moving, to a specific action (climbing), to its exit from the scene (\"disappears from view\"). This gives the reader a sense of the video's beginning, middle, and end.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the detailed instructions with remarkable precision.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and packed with essential information.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The description is centered entirely on the animal, its appearance, and its actions.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It correctly uses a precise term (\"red panda\") and even follows the instruction for ambiguity by stating it \"appears to be a red panda based on its distinctive coloration and tail,\" which is a perfect way to express a confident but not absolute identification.\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It describes the fur, tail, and face, which are the most important visual keys for this animal.\n*   **Avoidance of Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"picture.\"\n*   **No Subjective Language:** The adjectives used (\"medium-sized,\" \"reddish-brown,\" \"long,\" \"bushy,\" \"black,\" \"large\") are all objective and descriptive, avoiding emotional or speculative language.\n*   **Describes Disappearance:** It explicitly follows the instruction to describe subjects that disappear, noting the animal \"disappears from view behind foliage and structures.\"\n*   **Proper Use of Background:** The background elements (\"grassy area,\" \"plants,\" \"wooden structures,\" \"fallen branch\") are only mentioned to describe where the animal is and what it is interacting with, which is the correct and intended use.\n*   **Natural English:** The language is simple, clear, and flows naturally.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and meticulously crafted to meet every rule and guideline. There are no significant areas for improvement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a medium-sized animal with reddish-brown fur, a long bushy tail, and a black face, likely a red panda, as it navigates through a grassy area dotted with plants and wooden structures. The animal skillfully climbs along a large fallen branch before continuing its journey until it vanishes from sight behind the foliage and structures.",
