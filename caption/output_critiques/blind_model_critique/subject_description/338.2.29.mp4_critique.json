    "pre_caption": "The video features a restaurant scene with a focus on a woman in a denim jacket seated at a round table. She has light hair styled with volume and is engaged in conversation while holding a menu. Next to her, a woman with long dark hair and glasses, wearing a maroon vest over a white shirt, is eating an ice cream cone. The table is set with plates and drinks, indicating a meal in progress. In the background, other patrons and staff are visible, including a man in a white shirt and maroon vest walking past. The setting is a busy dining area with decorative wall art, creating a lively atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent and detailed feedback on the caption. Here is a breakdown of its performance against the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It provides specific, verifiable details about the subjects' appearances (denim jacket, light hair, glasses, maroon vest), their actions (engaged in conversation, holding a menu, eating an ice cream cone), and the objects present (round table, plates, drinks).\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the primary and secondary subjects, describes their key visual attributes and actions, and establishes their relationship to each other and the immediate setting. It paints a clear and comprehensive picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has some significant deviations. While it follows many rules well, it fails on several key points.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the scene.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It combines details into a coherent narrative without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses clear terms like \"woman,\" \"man,\" \"patrons,\" and \"staff.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on clothing, hair, and actions for the main subjects.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the two women and prioritizes the one in the denim jacket as the main focus.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n1.  **Contains Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction: \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The description should start directly with the subjects.\n2.  **Describes the Background Unnecessarily:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The caption describes \"other patrons and staff,\" a \"busy dining area,\" and \"decorative wall art.\" These details describe the general background rather than helping to distinguish a specific subject, which violates the rule.\n3.  **Uses Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses the phrase \"creating a lively atmosphere.\" The word \"lively\" is a subjective adjective that conveys a feeling or emotion, which is explicitly forbidden by the instruction: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The word \"busy\" is also borderline subjective.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a version of the caption that adheres strictly to all the given instructions:\n\nA woman with light, voluminous hair, wearing a denim jacket, is seated at a round table holding a menu and is engaged in conversation. Next to her, a woman with long dark hair and glasses, dressed in a maroon vest over a white shirt, eats an ice cream cone. On the table between them are plates and drinks. A man wearing a white shirt and a maroon vest walks past in the area behind the table.",
