    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary subject as a large historic building and a secondary subject as a cyclist, it contains several issues. The description includes subjective terms like \"grand\" and interpretive phrases such as \"adding a dynamic element,\" which violate the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective language. Furthermore, the final sentence, \"The focus is on the architectural details and the overall impression...,\" is an analysis of cinematic intent rather than an objective description of visual content and should be omitted entirely. The caption also lacks sufficient detail for the subjects; for example, it fails to describe the cyclist's appearance, who I imagine is a man in a red jacket and black helmet riding a silver road bike from left to right across the foreground. The building's description could also be enhanced by including its material and color, such as specifying that the cathedral is made of light-gray limestone with a dark lead-colored dome. The description of the camera's movement is acceptable, but the overall caption would be stronger if it focused exclusively on providing a dense, objective account of the visible attributes of the subjects and their actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a cityscape featuring a large historic building, likely a cathedral, constructed from light-gray limestone with a dark lead-colored dome and smaller towers. The sky is bright blue with scattered white clouds. In the foreground, a man in a red jacket and black helmet rides a silver road bike from left to right. The camera captures the architectural details and the cyclist's movement across the scene.",
