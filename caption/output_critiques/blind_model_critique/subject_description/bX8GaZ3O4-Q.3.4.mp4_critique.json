    "pre_caption": "An open, dark-colored safe is built into a wall, its door swung open to the right. The edge of the thick door features three small, glowing pinkish-purple circular lights arranged vertically. The safe's frame is ornate and silvery, with a distorted, almost melted appearance. Inside, two shelves are visible. On the bottom shelf rests a stack of white papers, with a circular emblem visible on the topmost sheet, while a single sheet of paper lies on the upper shelf. To the left of the safe, a table lamp with a white, bell-shaped shade sits on a light-colored table. The lamp has an ornate, fluted base that appears to be made of gold or brass.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption is highly accurate and provides a comprehensive description of the subjects. It meticulously details the safe's state (open), color (dark), location (built into a wall), and specific features like the \"three small, glowing pinkish-purple circular lights\" and the \"distorted, almost melted appearance\" of its frame. It also accurately describes the contents on the shelves and the secondary subject, the table lamp, with specific details about its shade, base, and apparent material.\n\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is presented as a single, coherent paragraph in simple, natural English. It is concise yet packed with essential information, allowing a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene without any ambiguity.\n\n*   **Adherence to Negative Constraints:**\n    *   It correctly avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It does not mention motion, which is appropriate for a static scene.\n    *   It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"mysterious\"). Words like \"ornate\" and \"distorted\" are used as objective visual descriptors.\n    *   It refrains from speculating on things that are not visible, correctly using cautious phrasing like \"appears to be made of gold or brass\" when the material isn't certain.\n\n*   **Subject Identification and Prioritization:** The caption clearly identifies the subjects using precise terms (\"safe,\" \"table lamp,\" \"papers\"). It follows the instructed hierarchy by describing the most prominent subject, the safe, in great detail first, before moving on to the secondary subject, the lamp, and its location relative to the safe.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of following the instructions. It is objective, detailed, well-structured, and provides a complete and accurate description of the video's subjects and their visual attributes.",
