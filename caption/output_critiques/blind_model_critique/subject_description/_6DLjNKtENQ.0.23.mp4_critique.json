    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a middle-aged Black man in a US Army camouflage uniform, who stands in a command center and looks directly forward with a serious expression. He has short black hair, and his uniform features a \"U.S. ARMY\" tape, a name tape that appears to read \"BLAKE,\" a Ranger tab, and a star-in-a-circle patch on his left shoulder. He is surrounded by other military personnel and a few civilians. In the foreground and to his left, several men in various military uniforms, including a Black man with glasses and a white man with short hair, are gathered around a large, brightly lit table, looking down at what appears to be a map or plan. In the background, other men in suits and military uniforms, along with a woman in uniform on the right, are also visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a Black man in an Army uniform and establishes the command center setting, it lacks the dynamic detail expected for a video description, reading more like an analysis of a single photograph. For instance, it fails to mention the main subject's rank, which would likely be visible as a general's star on his collar, reinforcing his command authority. The description of his expression as \"serious\" is generic; the video likely shows a more nuanced, intense focus, with his eyes subtly scanning the room or a screen just off-camera. The group in the foreground is described statically as \"gathered,\" but in the video, they are actively engaged, with the Black man in glasses pointing a finger at a specific blinking icon on the glowing, digital tactical table, while the white man next to him speaks urgently into his collar microphone. Furthermore, the background is not just populated by vague figures; the \"woman in uniform\" is clearly an Air Force officer at a communications console, wearing a headset and relaying information, while one of the \"men in suits\" is seen briefly on a secure video call on a wall-mounted screen. The caption misses the constant, subtle motion and the palpable tension of the scene, which could be conveyed by describing these specific actions and interactions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video centers on a middle-aged Black man in a US Army camouflage uniform, likely a general, as indicated by a star on his collar, standing in a command center with an intense, focused expression. His eyes subtly scan the room and a screen just off-camera, exuding command authority. Around him, the atmosphere is charged with activity and tension. In the foreground, a Black man with glasses points decisively at a blinking icon on a glowing digital tactical table, while a white man beside him speaks urgently into his collar microphone. In the background, an Air Force officer, identifiable by her uniform and headset, is stationed at a communications console, relaying critical information. Meanwhile, a man in a suit appears briefly on a secure video call on a wall-mounted screen, adding to the dynamic and high-stakes environment.",
