    "pre_caption": "A young, light-brown-skinned girl with dark, curly hair lies in a bed, smiling and laughing. She is wearing a pink, long-sleeved, textured shirt and is propped up on grey pillows under a grey comforter. In the foreground, the hands of a light-skinned adult in a white shirt hold a sterile, packaged medical swab. The focus of the video shifts from the girl's face to the adult's hands holding the swab. In the bed with the girl are several stuffed toys, including a large pillow shaped like an animal with a red and white striped body and a white and pink plush toy with a fan-like tail.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subjects and the camera's focus shift, but it could better capture the narrative and emotional nuances of the scene. While it mentions the girl is laughing, it fails to connect this to the adult, who is likely speaking to her in a reassuring manner to ease her into the medical procedure. The description of the adult's action is too static; instead of just 'holding' the swab, the adult is likely shown deliberately opening the sterile packaging, an action emphasized by the rack focus. The caption also misses the likely shift in the girl's expression from general amusement to a more watchful or slightly nervous curiosity as her attention turns to the swab. Furthermore, the descriptions of the stuffed toys could be more precise; the 'animal' pillow might be a specific creature like a cat, and the 'plush toy with a fan-like tail' could be a recognizable character, which would be a more definitive detail. Finally, the description of the adult is minimal; noting if the 'white shirt' appears to be a casual shirt or part of a medical uniform would provide crucial context about their relationship to the child.",
