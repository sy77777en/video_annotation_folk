Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\nThe caption is **partially good** but fails to follow several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and formatting.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** The caption accurately identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and correctly describes the typical elements of such a scene: an urban street, storefronts, signage, and pedestrians. It correctly assesses that the focus is on the overall environment rather than a specific, salient subject.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Mostly Complete:** The caption provides a good overview of the scene, fulfilling the specific instruction for describing a scenery shot. It explains that the focus is on the environment and atmosphere, which is the correct approach when no single subject is prominent.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints:\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The most significant failure is the repeated use of subjective adjectives. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses \"vibrant,\" \"lively,\" \"bustling,\" \"dynamic,\" and \"energetic.\" These words describe a feeling or an interpretation rather than objective visual facts.\n    *   **Correction Example:** Instead of \"a vibrant urban street scene\" with a \"lively atmosphere,\" it should describe the visual evidence, such as \"an urban street with numerous pedestrians\" and \"storefronts with brightly lit, multi-colored signs.\"\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Introductory Text:** The instruction asks for \"**only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.**\" The caption begins with \"The video is a cityscape scenery shot,\" which is a meta-commentary about the video rather than a direct description of its content. The description itself should make it clear what kind of shot it is.\n\n*   **PARTIAL ADHERENCE - Describing Visual Attributes:** While the scenery shot rule allows for a broader focus, the caption could have been more descriptive with objective details. Instead of just \"colorful storefronts,\" it could have mentioned specific colors or types of architecture if visible. Instead of \"people walking,\" it could have noted the density of the crowd.\n\n**In summary:** The caption correctly identifies the video type and its general content. However, its heavy reliance on subjective, emotional language is a direct violation of a core instruction. It also includes introductory phrasing that should have been omitted. A better caption would describe the same scene using purely objective and factual language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An urban street scene features numerous pedestrians and storefronts with brightly lit, multi-colored signs. The environment includes a mix of modern and traditional architectural elements, with people engaging in various daily activities. The scene captures the diverse and active nature of the city without focusing on a specific subject.",
