    "pre_caption": "A central male figure, rendered in a solid, bright red, stands with his hands behind his back, wearing a long coat and a matching cap. Flanking him on either side are two identical male figures in military-style uniforms, complete with caps. These two figures, who are holding rifles, are rendered in a reddish-brown color and have a distinct, intricate mesh-like texture. They stand at attention, creating a symmetrical composition around the central red figure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is excellent and perfectly follows the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"male figures\" and precisely describes their distinct visual styles: the \"solid, bright red\" of the central figure versus the \"reddish-brown color\" and \"intricate mesh-like texture\" of the flanking figures. It accurately notes their clothing (\"long coat,\" \"military-style uniforms,\" \"caps\"), their poses (\"hands behind his back,\" \"stand at attention\"), and the objects they hold (\"rifles\").\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It captures all the essential visual information about the subjects and their arrangement. It effectively describes the symmetrical composition and the relationship between the central figure and the two guards, providing a full picture of the scene's key elements.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption demonstrates a flawless adherence to the rules:\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** It is a single, well-written paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the subjects, their attributes, and their relationship to each other, correctly omitting background details.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types (\"male figure\").\n    *   **Objectivity:** It uses descriptive, objective language (\"solid, bright red,\" \"mesh-like texture\") and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Structure and Prioritization:** It logically starts with the most prominent \"central male figure\" before describing the secondary figures, as instructed.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It does an excellent job of distinguishing the multiple subjects by their color, texture, and location (\"central,\" \"flanking him on either side\").",
