    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky filled with a massive, low-hanging storm cloud system. These dark, ominous clouds form a distinct shelf-like structure that stretches across the horizon, contrasting with the lighter gray sky above. Below, a flat, reddish-brown expanse of earth provides a stark, empty foreground that accentuates the sheer size and power of the weather formation, making the storm itself the central element of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the storm system as the central focus, it relies heavily on subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"immense,\" and \"ominous,\" which should be replaced with more objective visual descriptions of the scene's components. For instance, instead of \"ominous,\" the caption could specify the clouds' dark gray and near-black coloration. The description of the foreground as a \"stark, empty expanse\" is also slightly inaccurate; in the video, a small, distant farmhouse is visible on the horizon to the right, and its tiny silhouette is a crucial element that visually establishes the storm's massive scale, which the caption only states conceptually. Furthermore, the caption misses key dynamic and color details that are present; it fails to mention the slow, visible rotation within the shelf cloud, a defining characteristic of the storm's movement, and overlooks the sliver of pale yellow light on the horizon, which creates a distinct visual contrast with the dark clouds and the reddish-brown earth. A more effective description would incorporate these specific visual cues to convey the scene's scale and atmosphere more factually.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases a landscape scene dominated by a vast storm system, emphasizing the visual elements and scale of the environment. The composition features a massive, low-hanging storm cloud system with a distinct shelf-like structure stretching across the horizon. The clouds exhibit a dark gray to near-black coloration, contrasting with the lighter gray sky above. Below, a flat, reddish-brown expanse of earth is punctuated by a small, distant farmhouse on the horizon to the right, its silhouette highlighting the storm's immense scale. The scene captures the slow, visible rotation within the shelf cloud, a key dynamic feature of the storm's movement. Additionally, a sliver of pale yellow light on the horizon creates a striking contrast with the dark clouds and the reddish-brown earth, enhancing the visual impact of the storm.",
