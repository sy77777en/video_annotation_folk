    "pre_caption": "The video features a person skateboarding in an urban setting. The skateboarder, wearing a pink long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and white shoes, is captured performing tricks near a statue and later on a cobblestone area. The individual appears to be male, with short hair, and is actively engaged in skateboarding maneuvers. In the background, there are other people walking, and a tram is visible, indicating a bustling city environment. The skateboarder is the central focus, showcasing skill and movement throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and setting, but it lacks the specific detail seen in the video. For instance, the skateboarder's \"dark pants\" are clearly black cargo pants, and the \"white shoes\" are a specific brand of skate shoe with a visible red stripe. The description of the actions is too general; the video shows the skateboarder successfully landing a kickflip near the bronze equestrian statue and later executing a boardslide along a low concrete ledge, details that are more descriptive than just \"performing tricks.\" A significant omission is the skateboard itself, which is a secondary subject; its deck features a colorful graffiti-style graphic and it has bright orange wheels, both clearly visible in several low-angle shots. The caption also misses the video's editing style, which consists of several hard cuts between different tricks and a slow-motion replay of the kickflip. Finally, the background elements are more dynamic than described; a vintage red tram passes directly through the scene, momentarily pausing the action, which is a more active role than simply being \"visible.\"",
