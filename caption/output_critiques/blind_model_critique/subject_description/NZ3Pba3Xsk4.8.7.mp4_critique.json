    "pre_caption": "The video shows several deer with slender bodies, light brown fur, and white markings on their undersides and tails. Some of the deer have short, straight antlers, while others do not, suggesting a mix of males and females. The deer are standing or walking in different areas, with one deer facing forward near the center and others positioned farther back or to the sides. The group appears calm and alert, with their heads raised and ears pointed forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has minor areas for improvement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"deer\" and precisely describes their key physical traits: \"slender bodies, light brown fur, and white markings on their undersides and tails.\" The observation that some have \"short, straight antlers\" while others do not is also accurate and leads to a reasonable, well-qualified inference about the group being a \"mix of males and females.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It provides a holistic view of the scene by describing the deer as a group, noting their different positions (\"near the center,\" \"farther back or to the sides\") and postures (\"standing or walking,\" \"heads raised and ears pointed forward\"). It successfully captures the most essential visual information without getting lost in unnecessary detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but there are two minor points where it could be improved:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n    *   It correctly uses a precise subject type (\"deer\").\n    *   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to specific moments in time.\n    *   It effectively describes multiple subjects as a group while also noting individual differences (antlers, position).\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    1.  **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which is a form of introductory text. The instructions state to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A more direct description that starts immediately with the subject (e.g., \"Several deer with slender bodies...\") would be more compliant.\n    2.  **Subjective Adjectives:** The caption uses the phrase \"calm and alert.\" The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" While \"alert\" is strongly supported by the objective description that follows (\"heads raised and ears pointed forward\"), \"calm\" is an interpretation of the animals' internal state. The caption would be stronger and more compliant by removing these subjective words and letting the physical description speak for itself.",
