    "pre_caption": "This video presents a stunning time-lapse seascape, captured from a high-angle perspective aboard a massive container ship. The view looks forward from the bow, over rows of blue, red, and white shipping containers, towards the endless, calm ocean. The primary focus is the dramatic transformation of the sky; initially, wispy clouds drift across a blue canvas, which then gives way to a spectacular sunset, painting the clouds in vibrant shades of pink and purple. As darkness falls, the colors deepen, and stars begin to emerge in the night sky. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the vastness of the open sea and the dynamic, atmospheric beauty of the changing sky, making the environment itself the central focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a seascape time-lapse from a container ship but relies too heavily on subjective adjectives like \"stunning,\" \"dramatic,\" and \"spectacular,\" which violates the instruction to use objective language. While it mentions the sky's transformation, it misses key visual details that would likely be present in such a video; for example, it fails to describe the sun's reflection moving across the calm ocean's surface as it sets, or the apparent circular motion of the stars forming trails as the night progresses. The description of the shipping containers is generic; it could be improved by noting their stacked formation and any visible markings or textures. Furthermore, the final sentence is overly analytical, explaining the compositional intent rather than describing the scene. A better approach would be to let the descriptive details themselves convey that the environment is the focus. Finally, the phrase \"captured from a level-angle perspective\" is an unnecessary technical detail about the cinematography and should be omitted in favor of simply describing the visual point of view.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases a time-lapse seascape from the bow of a massive container ship, offering a forward view over stacked rows of blue, red, and white shipping containers. The calm ocean stretches endlessly ahead, reflecting the sun's light as it sets. The sky undergoes a remarkable transformation, starting with wispy clouds drifting across a blue expanse, transitioning to a sunset that bathes the scene in vibrant pink and purple hues. As night falls, the colors deepen, and stars appear, forming trails in the sky. The scene captures the vastness of the open sea and the dynamic beauty of the changing sky, with the environment itself as the central focus.",
