    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with a medium skin tone and short dark hair, who has a beard and mustache. He is wearing a dark leather jacket and is seen holding a sandwich, which he is eating. His expression is focused and intent as he takes a bite. The lighting casts shadows on his face, highlighting his features. The man is seated and appears to be in a contemplative or thoughtful state, as he looks upward in the latter part of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding subjectivity and completeness.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The physical description of the man (medium skin tone, short dark hair, beard, mustache, dark leather jacket) is accurate.\n*   The description of his actions (eating a sandwich, looking upward) is also accurate.\n*   However, the statement that he is in a \"contemplative or thoughtful state\" is a subjective interpretation of his mental state, not a direct observation of a visual attribute. This violates the instruction to avoid describing what you are unsure about and to avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully identifies the main subject (the man) and describes many of his key attributes.\n*   It fails to provide a detailed description of the secondary subject, the \"sandwich.\" The instructions require describing objects' color, material, shape, and distinguishing features. The caption only identifies it as a sandwich without any further detail.\n*   The description of his expression as \"focused and intent\" is borderline, as it infers an internal state, but it is more closely tied to the physical action of eating than \"contemplative.\"\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violations:**\n    *   **Subjectivity:** The most significant failure is the use of subjective terms like \"contemplative or thoughtful state.\" This directly contradicts the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n    *   **Incomplete Object Description:** The caption neglects to describe the \"sandwich\" in detail, failing the instruction to \"describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features.\"\n    *   **Clunky Phrasing:** The phrase \"in the latter part of the video\" refers to a specific time segment, which goes against the spirit of describing the video holistically without referencing specific parts. A better phrasing would be \"and then looks upward.\"\n    *   **Redundant Introduction:** Starting with \"The video features...\" is unnecessary. The instructions ask for a direct description of the subjects.\n\n*   **Compliance:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly avoids using the words \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the subject's type (\"man\").\n    *   It provides a decent, though not fully complete, set of visual attributes for the man.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a poor attempt because it makes a critical error by including subjective emotional interpretations, which was explicitly forbidden. It also falls short by failing to provide a complete description of all salient subjects as required. To be considered \"good,\" the caption would need to remove the subjective language and add specific visual details about the sandwich.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man with a medium skin tone and short dark hair, along with a beard and mustache, is wearing a dark leather jacket. He is holding a sandwich, which appears to be on whole grain bread with visible layers of lettuce and tomato. The man is eating the sandwich with a focused expression. The lighting casts shadows on his face, highlighting his features. He is seated and looks upward at one point during the video.",
