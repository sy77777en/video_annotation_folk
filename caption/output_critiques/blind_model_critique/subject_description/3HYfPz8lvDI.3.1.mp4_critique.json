    "pre_caption": "The video features a conference room setting, initially highlighting two 3D models resembling buildings. These models are blue and have a sleek, modern design, positioned prominently in the foreground. In the background, a man is initially blurred but becomes the main focus as the camera shifts. He is standing with his back to the camera, facing a board displaying two building drawings. The man is wearing a dark suit, and only his upper body is visible. His hair is short and gray, and he appears to be examining the drawings closely, with one hand on his hip, suggesting a thoughtful pose.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a conference room, starting with a focus on two 3D models resembling buildings, with a man blurred in the background. The camera then moves forward, shifting focus to the man standing with his back to the camera, facing a board with two building drawings. Only his upper body is visible.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is very good, but it has a minor flaw regarding subjectivity.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects as two 3D models and a man. The descriptions of their appearance (blue models, man in a dark suit with short, gray hair) and their positions/actions (models in the foreground, man in the background facing a board) are precise. The description of the video's progression, starting with the models and shifting focus to the man, is also correct.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It covers all the essential elements: the subjects, their key visual attributes, their relationship to each other (foreground/background), and the dynamic shift in focus that defines the video's narrative. It successfully creates a holistic picture of the video's content.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Strengths:** The caption successfully follows most of the key instructions. It is a concise, single paragraph, avoids forbidden terms like \"frame,\" uses simple and clear language, and correctly identifies subject types. It effectively describes the subjects in the order of their prominence and explains the transition of focus from the foreground models to the background man.\n    *   **Area for Improvement:** The caption violates the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The phrase **\"suggesting a thoughtful pose\"** is an interpretation of the man's mental state rather than a neutral, visual description. The instruction is to describe the pose itself (\"with one hand on his hip\"), which the caption does, but the addition of \"thoughtful\" is subjective speculation. A better caption would omit this interpretive phrase. The term \"sleek, modern design\" is also slightly subjective but is generally acceptable as a common stylistic descriptor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to most of the complex instructions. Its only significant flaw is the inclusion of a subjective interpretation (\"thoughtful pose\"), which violates a specific negative constraint. By removing that single phrase, the caption would be in perfect compliance with the guidelines.",
