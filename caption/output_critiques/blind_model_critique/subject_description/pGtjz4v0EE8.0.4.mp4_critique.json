    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot of a lavishly decorated, multi-tiered opera house. The architecture is overwhelmingly opulent, with curved balconies adorned in gold leaf, intricate carvings, and numerous glowing light fixtures. Each tier of seating boxes features painted medallions and decorative elements, all contributing to a sense of historical grandeur, with a particularly ornate royal box draped in rich, dark red velvet curtains at the center. There is no main subject in the video, as the shot is designed to capture the magnificent atmosphere and architectural scale of the entire auditorium. The focus is on the environment itself, emphasizing its opulence rather than any single person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the setting as an opulent opera house, it misses several key visual details and relies too heavily on subjective descriptors like \"lavishly\" and \"magnificent,\" which should be replaced with more objective descriptions of the materials and design. The description fails to mention the vast, empty orchestra seating area on the main floor, filled with rows of seats upholstered in the same dark red velvet as the royal box curtains. More significantly, it completely omits the grand ceiling, which features a massive, multi-tiered crystal chandelier at its center, surrounded by an intricate fresco depicting a celestial scene. The most critical oversight is the assertion that there is no main subject; a lone man in a dark suit stands center stage, holding a violin. Although small in the vast space, his presence provides a crucial focal point and sense of scale, making him a salient subject whose posture and attire should be described. A more accurate caption would incorporate these missing elements—the main floor seating, the ceiling fresco and chandelier, and the solitary musician on stage—to provide a complete and objective account of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures the interior of a grand, multi-tiered opera house, showcasing its opulent architecture. The curved balconies are adorned with gold leaf and intricate carvings, while numerous glowing light fixtures illuminate the space. The main floor features a vast, empty orchestra seating area with rows of seats upholstered in dark red velvet, matching the royal box curtains. The ceiling is a masterpiece, with a massive, multi-tiered crystal chandelier at its center, surrounded by an intricate fresco depicting a celestial scene. On stage, a lone man in a dark suit stands holding a violin, providing a focal point and sense of scale within the expansive auditorium. His presence adds a human element to the scene, emphasizing the grandeur of the environment.",
