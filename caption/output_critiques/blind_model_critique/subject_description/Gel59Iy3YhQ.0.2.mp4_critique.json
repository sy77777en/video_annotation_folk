    "pre_caption": "The video features two abstract subjects. The central subject is a bright orange, amorphous figure that appears to be a cluster of particles or a fluid mass. Its shape is inconsistent, though it occasionally takes on a vaguely humanoid form. Another subject is a curved, white object, similar in shape to a crescent or a segment of a circle. This white shape is marked with red splatters that resemble blood, which also appear as a spray of particles near it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"abstract\" since they do not represent real-world objects in a literal way. It precisely describes their visual characteristics:\n*   **Orange Subject:** \"Bright orange,\" \"amorphous,\" \"cluster of particles or a fluid mass,\" and \"vaguely humanoid form\" are all accurate descriptors for a shifting, non-solid shape.\n*   **White Subject:** \"Curved, white object,\" \"crescent or a segment of a circle,\" and \"marked with red splatters\" accurately capture its appearance.\n*   The phrase \"resemble blood\" is a perfect choice, as it describes the visual appearance without making an unsubstantiated claim about what the substance is, thus avoiding speculation.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete, focusing on the most salient subjects and their key attributes. It successfully identifies the two main visual elements and provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene's components without being overwhelmed by minor details.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule in the instructions flawlessly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in just a few sentences.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the two abstract figures, their types, and their visual attributes.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the orange figure's shape as \"inconsistent\" and \"occasionally\" taking on a form, which indicates a description synthesized over the video's duration, not from a single static moment.\n*   **Clarity and Language:** It uses simple, natural English and is written as a single, coherent paragraph. It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Handling Ambiguity:** The caption's strongest point is how it handles the abstract nature of the subjects. By labeling them \"abstract subjects\" and using cautious phrasing like \"appears to be\" and \"resembles,\" it perfectly follows the instruction to avoid describing what is uncertain.\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between \"the central subject\" (orange) and \"another subject\" (white), using their unique visual traits to keep the description clear.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is exceptionally good. It is a model example of how to apply the instructions, particularly for a video with abstract or non-literal content. It is accurate, complete, and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of every constraint.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases two abstract entities. The primary entity is a vibrant orange, shapeless figure that resembles a cluster of particles or a fluid mass, with its form shifting and occasionally adopting a vaguely humanoid shape. The secondary entity is a curved, white form, akin to a crescent or a segment of a circle, adorned with red splatters that suggest the appearance of blood, accompanied by a spray of particles nearby.",
