This individual wears a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a beige, ribbed top.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It perfectly aligns with the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two distinct parts of the video: first, the hands of a person painting their nails, and second, a man wearing the same cardigan. All the described visual details—the fair skin, white nail polish, light blue fuzzy cardigan, beige ribbed top, the man's curly brown hair, mustache, white tank top, and gold chain—are precise and factually correct based on the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It captures all the essential information needed to understand the video's content and narrative. It describes the initial subject and action (painting nails) and then fully describes the second subject who is revealed. It successfully connects the two segments by noting that the man is wearing the \"same light blue, fuzzy cardigan,\" which is a key detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a compact, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes, correctly omitting any mention of the background.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types (\"person,\" \"man\"). The initial use of \"person\" is a perfect example of following the instruction to avoid describing what is uncertain, as the gender is not clear from the hands alone.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive but not subjective adjectives (e.g., \"fuzzy,\" \"ribbed,\" \"prominent\") and objectively describes the man's expression as \"neutral.\"\n*   **Handling Transitions:** It effectively describes the change in subject by structuring the sentences sequentially (\"The video features... The video then shows...\"), which clearly communicates the transition without needing to use technical terms like \"hard cut.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as required.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a person with fair skin painting their fingernails with white polish, wearing a light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a beige, ribbed top. It then transitions to a man with light skin, curly brown hair, and a prominent mustache, who is also wearing the same light blue, fuzzy cardigan over a white tank top. He accessorizes with a gold chain necklace and gazes directly at the camera with a neutral expression.",
