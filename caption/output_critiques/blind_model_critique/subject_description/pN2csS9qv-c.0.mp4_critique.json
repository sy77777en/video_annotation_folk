    "pre_caption": "The video features a gymnastics event with a focus on a female gymnast performing on the uneven bars. She is wearing a red leotard and is captured in motion, showcasing her athleticism and skill. Around her, several individuals are present, including coaches and judges. The coaches, dressed in dark clothing, are positioned near the gymnast, likely providing support and guidance. Judges are seated at a table, observing the performance. In the background, spectators are visible in the stands, watching the event. The setting is a gymnasium with banners and equipment indicating a competitive gymnastics environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject as a female gymnast and notes the presence of coaches, judges, and spectators. However, the descriptions lack the specific visual detail required by the instructions. For instance, the \"red leotard\" could be more precisely described as a \"sleeveless red leotard with silver sequin patterns across the chest,\" and key attributes of the gymnast, such as being a \"young woman with her brown hair tied in a tight bun,\" are omitted. The description of the coaches in \"dark clothing\" is too general; a more specific detail, like \"two men in black tracksuits, one standing directly beneath the bars in a spotting stance,\" would be more informative. The caption also uses the subjective phrase \"showcasing her athleticism and skill,\" which should be replaced with an objective description of her actions, such as \"swinging from the high bar to the low bar and performing a release move.\" Additionally, the caption presents a static snapshot rather than a dynamic event; it fails to describe the progression of the routine or mention any specific camera techniques I saw, like a slow-motion replay of her dismount. The final sentence about the setting is redundant, as the context is already established by the description of the subjects and their roles.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a gymnastics event featuring a young female gymnast performing on the uneven bars. She is wearing a sleeveless red leotard adorned with silver sequin patterns across the chest, and her brown hair is tied in a tight bun. The gymnast is seen swinging from the high bar to the low bar and executing a release move with precision. Two men in black tracksuits, one standing directly beneath the bars in a spotting stance, provide support and guidance. Judges are seated at a table, attentively observing the performance. Spectators fill the stands, eagerly watching the routine unfold. The video includes a slow-motion replay of her dismount, highlighting the grace and control of her landing.",
