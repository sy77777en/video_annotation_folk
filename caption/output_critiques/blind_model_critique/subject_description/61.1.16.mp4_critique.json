    "pre_caption": "The video features two women seated at a diner booth with red cushioned seats and a wooden table. The woman on the left has light skin, wears a green beret, glasses, and a patterned brown top, and is holding a camera while smiling. The woman on the right has light skin, wears a red beret, a dark jacket, and a red scarf, and is looking towards the camera. The table is cluttered with items including a drink cup, condiment bottles, and a basket with food. The setting suggests a casual dining environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two main subjects and the general setting, it lacks the specific visual detail needed to fully capture the scene and feels more like a description of a static photograph than a video. The description of the women is missing key attributes such as their hair color and style, which are crucial for identification. The caption could be improved by specifying the type of glasses the first woman wears (e.g., black-rimmed, wire-frame) and the pattern on her top (e.g., floral, geometric). Similarly, the type of camera she holds (e.g., a vintage film camera, a modern DSLR) is an important detail. For the second woman, her expression is omitted; describing if she is smiling, laughing, or has a neutral look would add significant context. The description of the table is generic; specifying the food in the basket (e.g., french fries, onion rings) and the type of drink (e.g., a milkshake in a tall glass, a soda in a paper cup) would create a more vivid picture. Most importantly, the caption fails to describe any action or interaction between the subjects, which is fundamental to a video. For instance, the woman on the left might be raising the camera to take a picture of her friend, who might be posing or laughing in response, or they could be in the middle of an animated conversation. Describing this movement or interaction would make the description more dynamic and accurate to the video format, while also removing the final interpretive sentence about the \"casual dining environment,\" which is already implied by the visual details.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the video, two women are seated at a diner booth with red cushioned seats and a wooden table. The woman on the left, with light skin and shoulder-length blonde hair, wears a green beret, black-rimmed glasses, and a floral-patterned brown top. She is smiling and holding a vintage film camera, raising it as if to take a picture. The woman on the right, also with light skin and short curly red hair, wears a red beret, a dark jacket, and a red scarf. She is smiling warmly at the camera, possibly posing for a photo. The table is cluttered with items, including a soda in a paper cup, condiment bottles, and a basket filled with french fries. The women appear to be engaged in a lively conversation, adding a dynamic element to the scene.",
