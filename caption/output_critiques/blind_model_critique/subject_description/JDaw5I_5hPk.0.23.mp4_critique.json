    "pre_caption": "This is a nature scenery shot presenting a close-up, dynamic view of a waterfall. Water cascades forcefully down a dark, textured rock face, splashing into a brilliant white spray and countless individual droplets that stand out against the shadowy background. To the right, a patch of lush, bright green foliage adds a vibrant contrast to the scene. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the powerful, natural action of the falling water and the immersive atmosphere it creates, rather than on a single, distinct object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully identifies the main subject as a waterfall and describes its key components and the camera motion involved. However, the description could be improved by adhering more strictly to objectivity and adding more specific visual detail. The use of subjective terms like \"brilliant,\" \"vibrant,\" and \"immersive atmosphere\" strays from the instruction to avoid emotional language. The description is also missing finer, observable details that I imagine are present in the video; for example, the \"light-colored rock face\" could be more precisely described as \"wet, glistening granite,\" and the \"dark veining\" might be more accurately identified as \"dark, vertical mineral streaks\" or \"crevices filled with moss.\" Furthermore, the caption omits the state of the water itself—I imagine it is clear and transparent as it falls before turning into spray, a key detail that is not mentioned. The opening phrase, \"This is a nature scenery shot,\" and the final sentence summarizing the focus are redundant and should be removed, allowing the description to stand on its own. Finally, while the camera tilt is noted, its full effect is not described; I imagine the tilt follows the water's descent to reveal the churning, turbulent pool at the base of the falls, a significant part of the scene that is currently overlooked.",
