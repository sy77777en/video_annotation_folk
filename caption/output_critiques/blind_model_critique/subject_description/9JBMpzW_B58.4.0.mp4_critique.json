    "pre_caption": "This video captures a stunning seascape scenery shot from the perspective of a large container ship navigating the open ocean. The focus is on the immense scale of the environment and the tranquil atmosphere of a night at sea, rather than on any single subject. The wide-angle view from the bow, looking over stacks of colorful shipping containers, leads the eye across the dark, calm water to the distant horizon. Above, the deep night sky is densely packed with brilliant stars, revealing the faint, glowing band of the Milky Way and a distinct constellation, while a warm, orange light from a far-off city illuminates the horizon to the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a seascape scenery shot and captures the general mood, it misses several key visual details and includes subjective language. The use of \"stunning\" and \"brilliant\" should be avoided in favor of more objective descriptions. The caption states the water is \"calm,\" but it completely omits the prominent, churning white wake trailing directly behind the bow, a significant visual indicator of the massive ship's powerful movement through the ocean. Furthermore, the description of \"colorful shipping containers\" is too vague; the video clearly shows stacks of red, dark blue, and grey containers, some glistening with sea spray under the starlight. The caption also vaguely mentions \"a distinct constellation\" when the prominent belt and sword of Orion are clearly visible to the left of the Milky Way. Finally, the description could be enhanced by noting the subtle but constant visual effect of the ship's own lights, such as the faint red and green navigation lights at the bow and the dim deck lighting casting soft reflections on the wet surfaces of the nearest containers, adding a layer of authenticity to the scene.",
