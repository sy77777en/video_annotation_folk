    "pre_caption": "In a black and white video, a young man wearing dark overalls and a flat cap stands motionless in front of a two-story wooden house. The entire front facade of the house, featuring scalloped shingles on the lower half and a window, detaches and falls forward. The man does not move as the wall crashes to the ground around him, leaving him standing perfectly in the open space previously occupied by the window. Behind him, the now-exposed interior of the house is a pile of rubble and debris.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It is highly accurate, complete, and adheres meticulously to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subjects as a \"young man\" and a \"two-story wooden house.\" The description of the action—the house facade detaching and falling forward, leaving the man standing unharmed in the window's open space—is a precise and factual account of the event in the video. The details about the man's clothing (\"dark overalls and a flat cap\") and the house's appearance (\"scalloped shingles\") are also correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential information needed to understand the video's content without being overly long. It establishes the scene (black and white, a man in front of a house), describes the subjects, details the critical action, and explains the final result (the man is safe, the interior is rubble). It successfully synthesizes the entire sequence into a single, coherent narrative.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows every instruction flawlessly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the man and the house facade, describing their attributes and the action involving them.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** It describes the events objectively (e.g., \"stands motionless,\" \"does not move\") without guessing the man's emotions.\n*   **Precise Language:** It uses specific terms like \"young man,\" \"house,\" \"facade,\" and \"overalls.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It includes key visual details for both the person and the object.\n*   **Necessary Motion:** It describes the motion of the facade falling because this action is the central point of the video.\n*   **Logical Order:** It introduces the subjects and then describes their dramatic interaction, which is a logical and effective way to structure the narrative.\n*   **Format:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a black and white video, a young man in dark overalls and a flat cap stands still in front of a two-story wooden house. The entire front facade, adorned with scalloped shingles on the lower half and featuring a window, detaches and falls forward. Remarkably, the man remains unmoved as the wall crashes down around him, perfectly positioned in the open space where the window once was. Behind him, the now-exposed interior reveals a chaotic pile of rubble and debris.",
