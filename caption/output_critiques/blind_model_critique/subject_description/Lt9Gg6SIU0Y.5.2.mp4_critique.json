    "pre_caption": "The video features a dense array of small, glowing blue dots arranged in three-dimensional space, forming lines and patterns that converge toward a central vanishing point. The dots vary slightly in size and brightness, creating a sense of depth and perspective. The overall arrangement gives the impression of a digital or abstract network, with the dots connected by faint, linear paths that radiate outward. There are no recognizable people, animals, or conventional objects; the primary subjects are these luminous points and their geometric organization, which together create a visually complex and abstract scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly aligns with all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes what appears to be an abstract, digital animation. It correctly identifies the primary visual elements as \"small, glowing blue dots\" and precisely describes their arrangement in \"three-dimensional space,\" forming \"lines and patterns that converge toward a central vanishing point.\" The use of terms like \"vanishing point\" and \"radiate outward\" demonstrates a strong understanding of the visual composition.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It not only describes the individual subjects (the dots) and their attributes (size, brightness, color) but also their collective structure (\"dense array,\" \"digital or abstract network\"). Crucially, it addresses the absence of conventional subjects (\"no recognizable people, animals, or conventional objects\"), which is a key piece of information for understanding this type of abstract video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in a single, well-structured paragraph without being overly wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The entire description is centered on the subjects (the dots and their geometric organization).\n*   **Holistic View:** It describes the overall scene and structure, not just a single moment.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and refrains from using subjective, emotional adjectives. \"Visually complex\" is used as a factual descriptor of the scene's density, not an emotional judgment.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** For an abstract video, \"small, glowing blue dots\" is the most precise and accurate subject type possible.\n*   **Handling of Scenery/Abstract Shots:** It perfectly executes the specific instruction for videos without salient subjects. It identifies the scene type (\"digital or abstract network\") and explains why there is no main subject, noting that the focus is on the \"luminous points and their geometric organization.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions to an abstract video. It is clear, detailed, and technically flawless according to the rules provided.",
