    "pre_caption": "A herd of light brown Asian elephants is gathered in a grassy area. Two large adult elephants are in the foreground. The elephant on the left is in profile, facing left. The second adult elephant, positioned more centrally, has a patch of dark mud on its back and is angled slightly forward. Clustered near the central adult are at least two very small baby elephants; one is partially visible behind the adult's rear legs, and another is near its front legs. The elephants all have pinkish tones on their skin, particularly around their faces and smaller ears.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good, clear overview of the scene, but it could be enhanced by incorporating more specific visual details and dynamic actions that are likely present in the video. The description of the elephants as \"light brown\" is a bit too general; the video probably shows their skin as a more complex dusty gray, with characteristic pinkish patches of depigmentation visible on the ears and trunk of the central adult. While the caption notes the elephants are \"gathered,\" it misses the subtle but important interactions that define a herd. For instance, the central adult is likely using its trunk to gently nudge or reassure one of the calves, and its ears might be slowly flapping to cool itself. The baby elephants are described as \"clustered,\" but the video probably shows more specific behaviors, such as one attempting to nurse while another playfully pushes against its sibling behind the mother's legs. Furthermore, the \"patch of dark mud\" on the central elephant's back could be described with more texture, perhaps appearing wet and glistening, suggesting a recent mud bath. Finally, confirming the \"Asian elephant\" identification by mentioning a key visual marker, such as their smaller, rounded ears compared to their African counterparts, would add a layer of expert observation to the description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a lush grassy area, a herd of dusty gray Asian elephants is gathered, their skin marked with characteristic pinkish patches of depigmentation, especially noticeable on the ears and trunk of the central adult. In the foreground, two large adult elephants stand prominently. The elephant on the left is in profile, facing left, while the central adult, slightly angled forward, has a wet, glistening patch of dark mud on its back, hinting at a recent mud bath. This central elephant gently uses its trunk to nudge or reassure one of the calves, its ears slowly flapping to cool itself. Near this adult, at least two very small baby elephants exhibit playful behaviors: one attempts to nurse, while another playfully pushes against its sibling behind the mother's legs. The smaller, rounded ears of these elephants confirm their Asian species, distinguishing them from their African counterparts.",
