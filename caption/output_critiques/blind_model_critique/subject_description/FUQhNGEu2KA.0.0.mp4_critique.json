    "pre_caption": "A woman with brown hair pulled back into a bun walks barefoot down a hallway. She is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeved, button-down pajama shirt with a plaid pattern. As she turns to look into a dark doorway, a tall, slender, silhouetted figure of a person is seen standing motionless in the darkness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes the two subjects and the sequence of events. It correctly identifies the first subject as a \"woman\" and provides specific details about her hair and clothing. It wisely describes the second subject as a \"silhouetted figure of a person,\" which is an accurate, objective description that avoids making assumptions about identity or gender based on limited visual information.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering all the key elements of the scene. It details the woman's appearance, her actions (walking barefoot, turning), and the context (hallway, dark doorway). It also fully describes the second figure's appearance (tall, slender, silhouetted) and state (motionless). The description of the reveal (\"As she turns... a... figure is seen\") is crucial and well-handled.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes, using the setting only to provide necessary context for their actions and locations.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives (e.g., \"scary,\" \"creepy\"). \"Motionless\" is an objective observation of the figure's state.\n    *   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"woman\" and \"figure of a person\" and avoids vague words.\n    *   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific visual details for both subjects as instructed (hair, clothing, build, posture).\n    *   **Temporal Order:** It describes the subjects and actions in the logical order they occur, which enhances clarity.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Handles Reveal:** It expertly describes the reveal of the second subject, which is a key moment in the video.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions, resulting in a clear, accurate, and objective description of the video's content.",
