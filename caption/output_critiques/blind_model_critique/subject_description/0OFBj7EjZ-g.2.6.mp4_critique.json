    "pre_caption": "The video features a single human subject, a person seated at a desk in a minimalist, tiled room. The person is wearing a light blue outfit and is focused on a computer screen in front of them. The desk is equipped with a monitor and a keyboard, and there are shelves and storage units on the walls. The person appears to be engaged in work or study, maintaining a consistent posture throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it follows some basic instructions like being a single paragraph and avoiding the word \"frame,\" it fails significantly in providing the required level of detail and adheres poorly to several key negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### 1. Lack of Completeness and Detail\n\nThe biggest failure of the caption is its lack of descriptive detail, which is a core requirement of the instructions.\n\n*   **Human Subject:** The instructions ask for details like \"clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity.\" The caption only mentions a \"light blue outfit.\" It fails to describe the person's gender, approximate age, hair color/style, or skin tone, all of which are essential attributes. It uses the vague term \"person\" when a more precise term like \"man\" or \"woman\" might have been possible.\n*   **Objects:** The instructions state to describe objects' \"color, material, shape, and distinguishing features.\" The caption identifies a \"desk,\" \"monitor,\" and \"keyboard\" but provides no visual attributes for any of them. For example, it doesn't mention if the desk is wood or metal, what color the keyboard is, or the size/shape of the monitor.\n\n### 2. Poor Adherence to Negative Constraints\n\nThe caption violates several rules about what to avoid.\n\n*   **Describing the Background:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary.\" The caption unnecessarily describes the setting as a \"minimalist, tiled room\" and mentions that \"there are shelves and storage units on the walls.\" These details are part of the background and are not needed to describe the main subject.\n*   **Using Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" While \"minimalist\" doesn't convey emotion, it is a subjective descriptor of style, which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions (e.g., \"a room with white walls and a single wooden desk\").\n*   **Describing Inferred Actions:** The caption states the person \"appears to be engaged in work or study.\" The instruction is to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" While this is a reasonable inference, a more objective description would focus only on the visible action: \"a person looking at a computer screen and using a keyboard.\"\n\n### 3. Accuracy and Phrasing\n\n*   The phrase \"The video features a single human subject\" is slightly redundant and overly clinical. A more natural start would be \"A person is seated at a desk...\"\n*   The caption correctly synthesizes the video's duration by noting the person \"maintain[s] a consistent posture throughout the video,\" which is a good application of the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a very high-level, generic summary. It fails to deliver the specific, detailed, and objective visual description that the instructions explicitly demand, making it a poor and unhelpful caption according to the given rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A middle-aged woman with light brown skin and shoulder-length black hair is seated at a metal desk in a room with white walls. She is wearing a light blue blouse and black pants. The woman is focused on a large, rectangular computer monitor and is typing on a black keyboard. The desk also holds a small stack of papers and a silver pen.",
