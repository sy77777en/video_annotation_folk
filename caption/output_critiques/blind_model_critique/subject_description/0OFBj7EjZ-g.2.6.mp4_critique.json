    "pre_caption": "The video features a single human subject, a person seated at a desk in a minimalist, tiled room. The person is wearing a light blue outfit and is focused on a computer screen in front of them. The desk is equipped with a monitor and a keyboard, and there are shelves and storage units on the walls. The person appears to be engaged in work or study, maintaining a consistent posture throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and the minimalist setting, it lacks the specific visual detail required by the instructions. The description of the subject as \"a person\" is too generic; it should specify gender, approximate age, skin tone, and hairstyle, such as \"a young woman with light brown skin and dark hair tied in a bun.\" The \"light blue outfit\" could be more descriptively rendered as a \"light blue sweatshirt and matching sweatpants.\" Furthermore, the caption's description of the objects is vague and potentially inaccurate. Instead of a \"computer screen\" and \"monitor,\" the video might feature a specific device like \"a silver laptop,\" and the caption omits other salient objects on the desk, such as a \"white ceramic mug\" and a \"closed black notebook,\" which are key to painting a complete picture. The phrase \"appears to be engaged in work or study\" is an interpretation of the action, whereas the instructions call for a direct description of the observable action, like \"typing on the laptop with their gaze fixed on the screen.\" Finally, the \"shelves and storage units\" are mentioned without describing their style or color, which could be \"white, floating shelves\" and \"white, built-in cabinets,\" details that are crucial for a comprehensive visual summary.",

She is typing on the laptop with her gaze fixed on the screen. The room is equipped with white, floating shelves and white, built-in cabinets on the walls, enhancing the minimalist aesthetic.",
