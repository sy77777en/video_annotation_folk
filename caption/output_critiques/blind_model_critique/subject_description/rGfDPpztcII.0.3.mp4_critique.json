    "pre_caption": "The video features a man, seen from a very close, first-person perspective, likely from a camera mounted on his helmet. He is wearing a light-colored, possibly white and grey camouflage-patterned ski jacket. He has a prominent, light brown or reddish beard and mustache, which become increasingly covered in white snow as the video progresses. He wears a light blue or teal ski helmet with an orange circular logo and white text \"pecsports.com\" on the side, and a sticker that says \"Be a HERO.\" His eyes are covered by large, orange-lensed ski goggles with a black frame and a light blue or teal accent on the nose bridge. His mouth is visible and open, and by the end, his beard and the area around his mouth are heavily coated in snow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately details the man's facial features and gear, it misinterprets the camera's perspective and misses key contextual information. The description of a \"first-person perspective\" is incorrect; a first-person view would show the scene from his viewpoint. The video is actually filmed from a reverse-facing camera, likely mounted on a helmet or a short pole, capturing his own face as he moves. The caption also fails to explicitly state the primary action, which is clearly skiing or snowboarding at high speed through deep powder snow. This context is crucial as it explains why his face and beard become caked in snow; the video likely shows plumes of powder kicking up and hitting him directly. Furthermore, while the static details of the helmet stickers are noted, the description could be improved by more vividly describing the dynamic action, such as the repeated impact of the snow spray. Finally, the caption focuses solely on his head and face, but the video intermittently shows his gloved hands gripping ski poles and the tips of his skis at the bottom of the view, which are relevant details to include for a more complete description of the subject.",
