    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a \"woman\" and an \"object\" and precisely describes their visible attributes, such as the woman's \"light skin,\" \"short, dark hair,\" \"white outfit with orange stripes,\" \"hood,\" and \"goggles.\" It also accurately notes the object's appearance as \"large, white... with a black panel and buttons.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It not only details the static appearance of the subjects but also captures the key action and change over time (\"Her expression changes from serious to surprised as she looks towards...\") without referring to specific frames. This provides a complete summary of the video's main event.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, fluent paragraph that is rich with detail but remains concise.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes, avoiding any mention of the background.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective language. While \"serious\" and \"surprised\" describe expressions, they are used here to denote observable facial changes rather than making a subjective emotional judgment.\n    *   **Precise Terminology:** It uses the precise term \"woman\" and appropriately describes the other subject as an \"object\" since its specific function isn't clear, thus avoiding speculation.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n    *   **Logical Structure:** It correctly prioritizes the main subject (the woman) before describing the secondary object she interacts with.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, detailed, objective, and structured perfectly to give a reader a thorough understanding of the video's content.",
