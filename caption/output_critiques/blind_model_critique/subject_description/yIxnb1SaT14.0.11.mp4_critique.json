    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot focused on the top of a grand, classical monument illuminated against a dark night sky. The central feature is a magnificent quadriga sculpture, where a gleaming golden figure of a woman stands in a chariot, guiding four rearing horses of a striking teal or verdigris patina. Flanking this centerpiece are other stone statues of what appear to be soldiers, and the facade below is adorned with intricate bas-relief carvings and a large inscription. There is no main subject in the traditional sense, as the camera's static gaze is fixed on the architectural element itself, emphasizing the majestic scale and dramatic lighting of the structure to create a powerful, atmospheric scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the monument and its quadriga as the central subject, it could be improved by adhering more strictly to objective description and providing greater detail likely visible in the video. The description relies on subjective adjectives such as 'grand,' 'magnificent,' and 'powerful,' which should be replaced with more concrete visual attributes. For instance, the 'gleaming golden figure of a woman' might be more accurately described as a winged goddess of victory holding a laurel wreath, if such details are visible upon zooming in. The 'other partially visible golden figure' is described too vaguely; the video likely offers a clearer view of its form and action. Furthermore, the description of the facade could be more specific by noting the subject of the 'intricate bas-relief carvings' (e.g., a battle or a procession) and the language of the 'large inscription.' The caption also omits any surrounding cityscape elements, such as the street below or distant building lights, which would provide important context and scale. Finally, the camera movement described as 'dynamically zooms in' could be more precisely detailed, for example, as 'a slow, continuous zoom that tightens from a wide shot onto the sculpture,' to better reflect the specific visual sequence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a cityscape at night, focusing on the top of a classical monument illuminated against the dark sky. The central feature is a quadriga sculpture, with a winged goddess of victory holding a laurel wreath, standing in a chariot and guiding four rearing horses with a teal or verdigris patina. Flanking this centerpiece are stone statues of soldiers, and the facade below is adorned with bas-relief carvings depicting a battle scene, along with a large inscription in Latin. The camera employs a slow, continuous zoom, transitioning from a wide shot to a close-up of the sculpture, emphasizing the architectural details. The surrounding cityscape includes the street below and distant building lights, providing context and scale to the scene.",
