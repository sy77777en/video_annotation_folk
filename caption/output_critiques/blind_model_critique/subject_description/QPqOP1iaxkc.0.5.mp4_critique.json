    "pre_caption": "This video presents an indoor scenery shot of a public transit station corridor. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere of the space rather than a specific subject, with the wide, moving perspective capturing the setting's character. The view pans from behind a green paneled wall to reveal a narrow passageway containing a ticket booth with a large glass window. On the opposite white wall, a yellow emergency call box is mounted, and further down the corridor, two police officers in dark uniforms stand conversing, contributing to the ambiance of a functional, public area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the setting as a public transit corridor and notes the camera's panning motion, it mischaracterizes the scene by labeling it a \"scenery shot\" and downplaying the significance of the police officers. In the video, the pan concludes by lingering on the two officers, establishing them as the primary subjects rather than mere atmospheric elements. The description of them is also too general; the video clearly shows one officer is a man with a short beard and the other is a woman with her hair tied back, and their \"dark uniforms\" are specifically navy blue with city transit authority patches on the sleeves. Furthermore, the caption misses key environmental details that define the space, such as the polished but scuffed concrete floor that reflects the cool, white light from overhead fluorescent fixtures, and a digital ticker sign above the ticket booth displaying scrolling red text. The description of the officers \"conversing\" is vague; the man is actively gesturing with his right hand while speaking, and the woman listens with her head slightly tilted. Finally, the caption omits the presence of a few other commuters who walk briskly through the background, a detail essential for conveying the \"functional, public area\" atmosphere it aims to capture.",
