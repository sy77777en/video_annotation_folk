    "pre_caption": "A person, seen from a low angle showing their lower legs and feet, stands on a patch of green grass. They are wearing light-colored, loose-fitting trousers and dark blue suede sneakers with a white stripe on the side, white laces, and a brown gum sole. A yellow golf ball sits on the grass in front of the person's feet. A silver-colored iron golf club is positioned behind the ball, poised to be swung.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

It correctly identifies all the primary subjects: a person, a golf ball, and a golf club. The descriptions of their attributes are precise and verifiable from the video's content, such as the \"dark blue suede sneakers with a white stripe,\" the \"yellow golf ball,\" and the \"silver-colored iron golf club.\" The spatial relationships (\"in front of the person's feet,\" \"behind the ball\") are also described accurately.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information without including unnecessary details. It focuses on the subjects as instructed, providing rich detail on the person's attire (trousers and specific features of the sneakers) and the key objects involved in the scene (the ball and club). By mentioning the club is \"poised to be swung,\" it effectively describes the state and context of the objects without speculating.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the given rules meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and detailed.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the person, ball, and club, only mentioning the \"green grass\" as the immediate surface they are on.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types like \"person\" and \"golf club.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The description is factual and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific visual details for each subject, such as color, material, and distinguishing features, as requested.\n*   **Logical Structure:** It logically describes the largest subject (the person) first, followed by the objects central to the implied action.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand, creating a clear mental picture of the scene.",
