    "pre_caption": "The video features a clear glass mug filled with a layered coffee beverage, likely a latte, characterized by distinct layers of milk foam, coffee, and milk. The mug has a handle and a small red label on its side. The beverage is topped with a small amount of foam, and the glass is positioned on a dark countertop. The focus on the mug and its contents highlights the visual appeal of the layered drink.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by correctly identifying the main subject as a glass mug with a layered coffee drink. However, it could be improved by adhering more strictly to the instructions against speculation and subjectivity. The phrases \"likely a latte\" and \"appears to read 'NacRom'\" introduce uncertainty, which should be avoided; the caption should either state what is visible with confidence or describe the visual characteristics without guessing (e.g., \"a three-layered beverage\" or \"a red label with illegible black text\"). The final sentence, \"The focus on the mug and its contents highlights the visual appeal of the layered drink,\" is an interpretation of the video's intent rather than an objective description of its content and should be removed. Furthermore, the description could be enhanced with more specific visual details that might be present in the video. For example, instead of a generic \"dark countertop,\" it could specify a \"dark wood-grain surface\" or \"black marble.\" The description also misses potential dynamic elements, such as steam rising from the hot beverage, subtle swirling as the layers settle, or the action of a hand entering the frame to stir the drink with a spoon. Adding details about the orientation of the mug's handle or the presence of condensation on the glass would also create a more vivid and accurate picture of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a clear glass mug filled with a three-layered coffee beverage, featuring distinct layers of milk foam, coffee, and milk. The mug, which has a handle oriented to the right, displays a red label with illegible black text on its side. The beverage is topped with a small amount of foam, and the glass is positioned on a dark wood-grain surface. Steam gently rises from the hot drink, and subtle swirling is visible as the layers settle. A hand enters the frame to stir the drink with a spoon, and condensation is present on the glass, enhancing the vividness of the scene.",
