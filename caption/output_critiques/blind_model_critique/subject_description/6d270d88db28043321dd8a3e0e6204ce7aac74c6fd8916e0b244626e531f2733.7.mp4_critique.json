    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an aerial waterscape and adheres to the instruction to explain the absence of a main subject, it could be improved by removing subjective language and adding more specific visual detail. The use of words like \"serene\" and \"atmospheric\" conveys a mood rather than objective visual information, which the instructions advise against. The description of the key elements is too general; for example, \"elongated land formations\" could be more precisely described as \"long, narrow peninsulas covered in dark green vegetation,\" and the \"vast body of calm water\" could be enhanced by noting that it \"reflects the soft orange and purple light of the sky.\" Furthermore, the caption's structure feels formulaic, particularly the phrase \"There is no main subject because...\" which could be woven more naturally into the description. Instead of stating the shot type directly, the caption would be more effective if it began by describing the scene itself, such as, \"An aerial view captures a wide expanse of still water at dawn or dusk,\" immediately immersing the reader in the visual experience.",

Long, narrow peninsulas covered in dark green vegetation stretch into the water, dotted with numerous small, dark, slender boats. The focus is on the expansive environment, highlighting the interplay of natural elements rather than a specific object.",
