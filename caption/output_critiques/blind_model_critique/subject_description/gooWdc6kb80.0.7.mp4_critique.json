    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned man with dark hair, a short beard, and black-rimmed glasses sits at a wooden table, wearing a grey t-shirt with a muted floral pattern. In front of him, a collapsed pile of wooden Jenga blocks is shown reassembling itself into a tall, complete tower. To the left of the tower sit two large, white keyboard keys, one labeled \"Ctrl\" and the other \"Z.\" The man hovers his hand over these keys as the tower rebuilds, and once it is standing, he reaches out to carefully remove a single block from the middle of the structure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the subjects and the central action, but it could be more visually specific to better capture the video's likely style and details. The description of the Jenga tower \"reassembling itself\" is functionally correct but lacks visual flair; a more descriptive phrase like \"the scattered blocks rapidly fly back into place in a reverse time-lapse effect\" would better convey the magical or edited nature of the sequence. The man's interaction with the keys is understated. Instead of just putting \"his hand over these keys,\" the caption would be stronger if it specified the action, such as \"he presses the 'Z' key, which illuminates briefly as the tower rebuilds,\" directly linking his action to the on-screen effect. Furthermore, the man's facial expression is a missed opportunity for detail; mentioning if he has a look of intense concentration or a slight, knowing smile would add a crucial layer to his character. Finally, the description of the final Jenga move is a bit clunky; clarifying that \"he pulls a block from the bottom and, upon releasing it, the block floats on its own to the top of the tower\" would more accurately describe the supernatural physics at play and enhance the overall sense of wonder.",
