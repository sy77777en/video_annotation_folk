It has prominent whiskers and at one point raises its flippers. A procession of black and white penguins with open beaks stands on small, blocky platforms. A line of three light-colored, cartoonish elephants also appears, standing on their hind legs in a dancing pose with their trunks raised.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"seal,\" \"penguins,\" and \"elephants.\" It precisely describes their visual attributes (e.g., the seal's \"large, dark eyes\" and \"prominent whiskers,\" the penguins' \"open beaks,\" the elephants' \"trunks raised\") and their poses/actions (the seal \"lies on its stomach,\" the elephants are in a \"dancing pose\"). The description of the overall aesthetic as a \"black and white pencil sketch animation\" is also spot on.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is concise yet complete. It captures all the salient subjects and their most important features without getting bogged down in excessive detail. It successfully creates a holistic picture by mentioning actions that happen over time (\"at one point raises its flippers\") and the appearance of new subjects (\"elephants also appears\"). Including the unique background of \"stylized, glowing lotus flowers\" is a good choice here; while the instructions say to avoid mentioning the background, it is justified in this case because the background is a prominent, defining, and non-generic feature of the animation's overall style.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on describing the subjects and their visual attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids subjective emotional adjectives. The word \"cartoonish\" is used appropriately as a descriptor of artistic style, not as a qualitative judgment.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses specific terms (\"seal,\" \"penguins,\" \"elephants\").\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It effectively describes each group of subjects sequentially, clearly distinguishing them by type.\n*   **Format:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly balances detail with conciseness, follows all formatting and content rules, and provides a clear, accurate, and objective description of the video's content.",
