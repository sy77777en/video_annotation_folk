    "pre_caption": "The video features a dark map of the United States with a highlighted route connecting two locations: Offutt Air Force Base and Joint Base Andrews. The route is marked by a dashed orange line, suggesting a path or flight trajectory. Both bases are labeled in bold orange text, with small circular icons indicating their positions on the map. The map displays state boundaries and major cities in a subtle gray, providing geographical context. The overall visual emphasizes the connection between these two military bases.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects—the map, the route, and the two bases—it misses several key dynamic and stylistic details that are central to the video's presentation. The description of the plane icon as simply \"moving\" is an understatement; in the video, the icon glides smoothly along its trajectory while the dashed orange line is dynamically drawn in just ahead of it, creating a sense of live tracking and forward progress. The caption also omits the presence of a digital timer in the top-right corner of the screen, which displays the elapsed flight time and estimated time of arrival, adding a crucial layer of data to the visual. Furthermore, the \"circular icons\" for the bases are more detailed, featuring a subtle pulsating glow to draw attention to them as the origin and destination points. The \"dark map\" itself has a more specific, technical appearance, resembling a dark blue radar screen with a faint latitudinal and longitudinal grid overlay, and the video begins not with a static shot, but with a quick zoom-in from a national view to the specific northeastern corridor, an important transition that establishes the scale and focus of the flight. A more accurate caption would incorporate these animated elements and specific interface details to better reflect the video's data-rich, \"command center\" aesthetic.",
