    "pre_caption": "The video features a man sitting inside a vehicle, holding a takeout container with chopsticks. He has a medium skin tone, short dark hair, and facial stubble. He is wearing a dark jacket over a collared shirt. The man appears focused on eating, with the chopsticks poised above the container. The interior of the vehicle is dimly lit, and the window beside him is streaked with raindrops, suggesting a rainy setting outside. The steering wheel is visible, indicating he is in the driver's seat.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect** because it violates one key instruction, although it adheres well to most others.\n\n**Accuracy & Completeness:**\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a man in a vehicle with a takeout container, chopsticks, and specific visual attributes like his hair, facial hair, and clothing. The observation of raindrops on the window and the presence of the steering wheel are also accurate and add valuable context.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It covers the primary subject in detail, his action, the key objects he is interacting with, and the immediate setting, which is all that is necessary to understand the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths (What it does well):**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and packed with relevant information.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the main subject (the man) and his visual attributes, as instructed.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It mostly avoids subjective adjectives. \"Appears focused\" is an acceptable observation based on his posture and gaze, rather than an emotional judgment.\n    *   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"man,\" \"vehicle,\" \"takeout container,\" and \"chopsticks.\"\n    *   **Attribute Detail:** It provides excellent detail on the man's appearance (skin tone, hair, clothing) and pose (sitting, holding).\n    *   **Contextual Details:** It correctly uses background elements (raindrops, steering wheel) to provide necessary context about the location and situation without over-describing the background.\n    *   **No Forbidden Words:** It successfully avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Where it fails):**\n    *   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\". The instructions explicitly state, \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" This opening phrase is considered introductory text and directly violates this rule. The description should have started immediately, for example: \"A man with a medium skin tone sits inside a vehicle...\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption's content is excellent—it is accurate, detailed, and well-structured. It successfully captures the visual information of the video in a clear and objective manner. However, its failure to omit the introductory phrase \"The video features...\" makes it technically incorrect according to the strict formatting rules provided in the instructions. Therefore, while the descriptive quality is high, it is not a \"good\" caption in the sense of perfectly following all constraints.",
