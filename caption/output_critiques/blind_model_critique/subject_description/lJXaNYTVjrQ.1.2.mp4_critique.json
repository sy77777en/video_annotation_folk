    "pre_caption": "The video features a shirtless young man with short brown hair and a silver chain necklace, who is initially holding an unlit cigarette. Another person's hand, with a white sleeve visible, enters the frame and uses a silver lighter to light the man's cigarette. The man then brings the lit cigarette to his lips, inhales, and exhales a large plume of white smoke. On either side of the man, in the dark background, are candelabras with lit candles.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the primary subject and the core sequence of actions, but it lacks the specific visual detail and atmospheric nuance I see in the video. The description of the \"young man\" could be enhanced; I see him as light-skinned with a lean, athletic build, and his neutral expression is directed slightly downward and away from the camera, not engaging with the viewer. The phrase \"another person's hand\" is vague; the hand I see entering from the right is distinctly masculine, and the \"white sleeve\" is more specifically the crisp cuff of a dress shirt, suggesting a second, well-dressed individual just out of view. Furthermore, the caption misses the crucial role of the lighting. The \"candelabras\" are ornate, silver fixtures, and their flickering flames create a dramatic chiaroscuro effect, casting warm, moving highlights across the man's face and torso while plunging the surrounding space into deep shadow. Finally, the description of the smoke could be more dynamic; the \"large plume\" he exhales is thick and momentarily obscures his face before drifting slowly upwards, adding to the contemplative mood of the scene.",
