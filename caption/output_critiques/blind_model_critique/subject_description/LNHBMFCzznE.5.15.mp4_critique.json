    "pre_caption": "The main subject of the video is a woman with fair skin and brown, shoulder-length hair, who is standing on a stage and speaking. She is wearing a sleeveless black dress that ends just above her knees and black knee-high boots. She holds a microphone in her right hand and gestures with her left as she addresses an audience. The stage she stands on is elevated and covered with a square red carpet. In the foreground, seated in the dark, is the audience, visible primarily as silhouettes illuminated by the blue light from the stage. They are positioned below the stage and are watching the woman speak.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres closely to almost all of the complex instructions provided. It successfully creates a clear and detailed mental image of the video's content using objective and precise language.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   The caption appears to be very accurate. It identifies a clear main subject (a woman speaking on stage) and a secondary subject group (the audience).\n*   The description of the relationship between the subjects (the woman addressing the audience, who are watching her) is logical and well-defined.\n*   The details provided, such as the \"square red carpet\" and the audience being \"silhouettes illuminated by the blue light,\" suggest a careful and accurate observation of the visual information.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   The caption is exceptionally complete. It provides a thorough description of the main subject, including her physical attributes (fair skin, brown hair), clothing (sleeveless black dress, knee-high boots), and actions (holding a microphone, gesturing).\n*   It effectively includes key objects and environmental elements that provide essential context, such as the elevated stage and the microphone, without over-describing the background.\n*   The description of the audience is also well-executed, providing just enough detail (silhouettes, seated, watching) to establish their presence and role without detracting from the main focus, which aligns perfectly with the instructions for handling primary and secondary subjects.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the rules:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the subjects, their attributes, and their actions, only mentioning the background (stage, lighting) to provide necessary context for location and relationship.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"interesting\") and sticks to factual visual descriptions (\"black dress,\" \"red carpet\").\n    *   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Logical Structure:** It correctly prioritizes the main subject before moving to the secondary subjects, creating a logical flow for the reader.\n\n*   **Minor Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The opening phrase, \"The main subject of the video is...,\" is slightly redundant. The instructions ask for a \"simple, natural English\" description, and the caption would be more direct and natural if it started immediately with the description, like: \"A woman with fair skin and brown, shoulder-length hair stands on a stage and speaks.\" The detailed description that follows already makes it clear that she is the main subject.\n\nDespite this very minor point, the caption is a high-quality example that successfully meets the complex requirements of the instructions.",
