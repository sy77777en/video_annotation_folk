    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with a medium skin tone, wearing a light purple dress shirt. He has a bald head and is speaking into a headset microphone. His posture is upright, and he appears to be engaged in delivering a talk or presentation. The man is positioned prominently in the foreground, facing slightly to the side, suggesting he is addressing an audience. The background includes a screen displaying text and graphics, indicating a formal or professional setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good baseline description of the man, but it misses key dynamic elements and contextual details from the video. For instance, while it mentions he is speaking, it fails to describe his expressive hand gestures, such as pointing for emphasis or using open palms to address the audience, which are prominent throughout his presentation. The description of the background screen is too generic; in the video, the screen clearly shows a blue and white bar graph and a company logo in the top right corner, which are visible even when out of focus. The caption also omits the dark wood lectern in front of the man, upon which a glass of water sits. Furthermore, the description is static, whereas the video includes a hard cut midway through from the initial medium shot to a tighter close-up on the man's face, where his focused expression and the movement of his mouth as he speaks are more apparent. Finally, stating he \"appears to be engaged\" is a subjective inference; it would be more accurate to describe the physical actions that suggest this, such as his direct eye contact (with an off-screen audience) and animated facial expressions.",
