    "pre_caption": "From a high, top-down perspective, an animated character with dark hair is seen lying on their back. The character is dressed in a dark, long coat with a high, pointed collar over a white shirt. The coat is spread out on the ground around them, creating a shape reminiscent of bat wings. In the background, a smaller, less distinct figure is visible standing on the same surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the high, top-down perspective and provides a good description of the main character's coat, it lacks precision and contains errors that detract from its clarity. The typo \"bear\" should be \"near,\" and the sentence structure describing the fire hydrant is confusing; instead of calling it a \"less distinct figure which is actually a fire hydrant,\" it should be identified and described directly, for instance, as \"a red fire hydrant with peeling paint standing nearby.\" The description of the main subject could be more detailed; \"animated character\" is vague, and if gender is discernible, \"man\" or \"woman\" should be used. More specific attributes, such as the character's pale skin tone, closed eyes, or the specific style of their dark hair (e.g., short and messy), would enhance the description. Furthermore, \"the ground\" is a generic term; specifying the surface, such as dark, wet asphalt or cracked concrete, would provide crucial environmental context without over-describing the background. Improving these points would make the description more specific, objective, and visually informative.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high, top-down perspective, a male animated character with short, messy dark hair and pale skin is seen lying on his back. He is dressed in a dark, long coat with a high, pointed collar over a white shirt, and the coat is spread out on the ground around him, resembling bat wings. The surface beneath him is dark, wet asphalt. Nearby, a red fire hydrant with peeling paint stands, adding to the scene's detail. The character's eyes are closed, contributing to the overall visual narrative.",
