The scene is bathed in a cold, blue light, emphasizing the frigid and remote environment. A massive, dark, featureless cube, a surreal monolith, sits amidst the rugged peaks, its sheer size dwarfing the surrounding mountains. The focus is on the immense scale and the mysterious, unsettling atmosphere created by the juxtaposition of the natural landscape and the unnatural geometric form, rather than on a specific, active subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the video's content. It correctly identifies the main subjects as a \"vast, desolate mountain range covered in snow\" and a \"massive, dark, featureless cube.\" The description of the lighting (\"cold, blue light\") and sky (\"overcast\") also accurately reflects the visual information.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, perhaps to a fault. It successfully captures all the essential visual elements: the landscape, the anomalous object, the scale, and the overall lighting. It correctly identifies the focus of the shot as the juxtaposition of the natural and unnatural elements.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives\":** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly by using words that describe a feeling or atmosphere rather than an objective visual fact.\n    *   **Incorrect:** \"gloomy, overcast sky\" (\"gloomy\" is subjective).\n    *   **Correct:** \"overcast sky.\"\n    *   **Incorrect:** \"cold, blue light,\" \"frigid and remote environment\" (\"cold\" and \"frigid\" are subjective interpretations of the visual cues).\n    *   **Correct:** \"blue-tinted light.\"\n    *   **Incorrect:** \"surreal monolith,\" \"mysterious, unsettling atmosphere\" (\"surreal,\" \"mysterious,\" and \"unsettling\" are entirely subjective and emotional).\n    *   **Correct:** The caption should simply describe the cube and the landscape without assigning an emotional or atmospheric quality to them.\n\n2.  **Violation of Scenery Shot Instructions:** The instructions for a scenery shot state to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot... using one to three sentences.\" This caption is four sentences long, making it longer than specified.\n\n3.  **Use of Redundant Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"This is a landscape scenery shot of...\". A more direct and concise approach, as implied by the instructions, would be to start the description immediately, for example: \"A vast mountain range covered in snow sits under an overcast sky.\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately and completely describes the scene, it fundamentally misunderstands the core instruction to be objective and avoid emotional or interpretive language. The repeated use of subjective adjectives is a major failure that makes the caption \"not good\" according to the provided rules.",
