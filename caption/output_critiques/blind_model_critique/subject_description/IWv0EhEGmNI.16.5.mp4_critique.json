    "pre_caption": "A woman with blonde hair styled in a low, neat bun is seen from behind, wearing a white collared shirt. She is confronted by a man in full military gear, which includes a green jacket, a tactical vest with a \"G-25\" patch, and a black beanie. The man, who has a prominent mustache, holds a rifle and faces the woman directly. In the dark background, other similarly dressed and armed military figures stand out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two main subjects as a \"woman\" and a \"man,\" and the secondary subjects as \"military figures.\" The visual details are precise: the woman's \"blonde hair styled in a low, neat bun\" and \"white collared shirt,\" and the man's \"green jacket,\" \"tactical vest with a 'G-25' patch,\" \"black beanie,\" and \"prominent mustache.\" The description of their interaction (\"confronted by,\" \"holds a rifle and faces the woman directly\") accurately reflects the visual narrative.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive without being overly long. It captures all the essential elements:\n*   **Primary Subjects:** The woman and the main soldier are described in sufficient detail.\n*   **Secondary Subjects:** The other figures in the background are mentioned concisely (\"other similarly dressed and armed military figures stand out of focus\"), which is appropriate given their lack of focus.\n*   **Key Objects:** The man's rifle is noted as a critical part of the scene.\n*   **Context:** The relationship and orientation between the subjects (\"confronted by,\" \"faces the woman directly,\" \"seen from behind\") are included, which is vital for understanding the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption perfectly follows every rule outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It delivers key information in a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive but non-emotional adjectives (e.g., \"prominent mustache,\" \"neat bun\") and avoids subjective speculation.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"woman,\" \"man,\" \"military figures\") and distinguishes the subjects clearly.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details about clothing, hairstyle, facial hair, and gear as instructed.\n*   **Focus and Prioritization:** It correctly identifies the two main subjects and describes them in detail while summarizing the less important background elements.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, objective, detailed, and perfectly structured.",
