  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** This is a landscape scenery shot. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the lush forest, trees, and greenery. The emphasis is on the atmosphere and the immersive experience of the forest, rather than a specific object or subject.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It correctly identifies the video type and follows the specific structure required for scenery shots, but it violates a key instruction regarding objectivity.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video shows a forest landscape with no prominent subjects, the caption is accurate in its overall assessment. It correctly identifies the content as a \"landscape scenery shot\" featuring a \"forest, trees, and greenery.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete according to the rules for a scenery shot. It specifies the shot type (\"landscape scenery shot\") and provides a concise, one-to-three-sentence explanation for the absence of a main subject (\"The focus is on the natural environment... The emphasis is on the atmosphere... rather than a specific object or subject.\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Format:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Clarity:** It is concise and clearly communicates the nature of the video.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly follows the specific instructions for describing a scenery shot without salient subjects.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Subjectivity:** The primary failure is the use of subjective language, which the instructions explicitly forbid (\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\").\n        *   The word **\"lush\"** is a descriptive adjective but leans toward being subjective. A more objective alternative would be \"dense\" or \"abundant.\"\n        *   The phrase **\"immersive experience\"** is a clear violation. It describes a feeling or effect on the viewer, not a visual attribute of the scene itself. This is precisely the kind of subjective description the instructions aim to prevent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption's structure and classification of the scene are excellent and follow the instructions well. However, its use of subjective terms like \"lush\" and especially \"immersive experience\" is a direct violation of the rules. To be fully compliant, the caption should be revised to use purely objective, descriptive language.\n\n**Example of a more compliant caption:**\n\nThis is a landscape scenery shot of a dense forest with trees and green foliage. The focus is on the natural environment and atmosphere rather than on a specific subject.",
