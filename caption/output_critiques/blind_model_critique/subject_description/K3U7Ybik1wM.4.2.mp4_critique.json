    "pre_caption": "A dimly lit bedroom is shown, with the main focus on a bed made with white sheets and pillows. A small, circular, wall-mounted lamp next to the bed casts a warm, orange glow across the bedding, highlighting the rumpled texture of the sheets. A red pillow is partially visible behind the white ones. On the beige wall above the bed, there is a long, rectangular framed picture. An open doorway to the right of the bed reveals a view into a more brightly lit hallway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the bedroom scene, but it misses several key visual details that would make the description more precise and vivid. While it correctly identifies the bed as the central focus, it fails to mention the thick, grey comforter folded at the foot of the bed, which contrasts with the white linen sheets. The description of the pillows is incomplete; the video clearly shows the red pillow is a small, square velvet cushion placed in front of two larger white sleeping pillows. The 'long, rectangular framed picture' above the bed is more specifically a black-and-white panoramic photograph of a mountain range. The caption also under-describes the lamp, which is a modern, matte black metal fixture. Furthermore, the description of the camera movement is slightly awkward; a more accurate description would be that the shot slowly pans left, beginning on an abstract painting with prominent blue and gold brushstrokes before it moves out of view. Finally, the glimpse into the hallway reveals not just bright light, but also a dark wood console table against the far wall, an important detail that adds depth to the scene.",
