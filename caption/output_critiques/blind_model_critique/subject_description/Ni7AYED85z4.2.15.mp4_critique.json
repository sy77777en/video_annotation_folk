    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a person with light skin, wearing a brown leather jacket, holds a black camera with both hands. The camera is aimed at a body of calm, turquoise water, out of which several weathered wooden posts emerge vertically. A small white and grey seagull is perched on top of the most prominent central post. The scene is enveloped in a thick, white fog, causing more distant posts to appear as faint silhouettes. On the right, a modern post with a square concrete base and a metal pole stands near the edge of a walkway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption is highly accurate and comprehensive. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective and all the salient subjects: the person holding the camera, the camera itself, the body of water, the wooden posts, the seagull, and the modern post. It provides specific, verifiable details for each, such as the \"brown leather jacket,\" the \"calm, turquoise water,\" the \"weathered wooden posts,\" and the \"white and grey seagull.\" It also includes the crucial atmospheric element of the \"thick, white fog\" and its visual effect on the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is dense with information without being wordy.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on describing the subjects and their visual attributes, as instructed.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"mysterious\") and uses neutral, descriptive terms (\"weathered,\" \"prominent,\" \"thick\").\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise nouns (\"person,\" \"seagull,\" \"posts\") and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Specific Formatting and Style Rules:**\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the multiple posts by describing them as \"weathered wooden posts\" in the water versus the \"modern post with a square concrete base\" on the right. It also pinpoints the seagull's location on \"the most prominent central post.\"\n    *   **Logical Structure:** The description follows a logical flow, starting with the immediate subject (the person from a first-person view) and then moving to the scene they are observing, which is an intuitive and clear way to build the mental image.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The caption describes only what is visibly present and avoids making assumptions about things not seen.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of following the instructions. It is clear, detailed, objective, and structured logically, providing a complete and accurate description of the video's content.",
