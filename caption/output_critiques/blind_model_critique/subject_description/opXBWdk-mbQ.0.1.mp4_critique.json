    "pre_caption": "Three men are sitting in a row at a long white counter, eating lunch. The man in the foreground, who is the most in focus, is a light-skinned man in his late 20s or early 30s with short, neat brown hair. He is wearing a maroon polo shirt and is seen in profile, eating a salad from a clear plastic container with a fork. To his right, slightly out of focus, is another light-skinned man in his 30s with short, dark hair, wearing a dark green t-shirt. He is taking food out of a brown paper bag. Furthest in the background and most out of focus is a third light-skinned man with dark hair, wearing a white collared shirt, who is also eating.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation by identifying the three men and their primary actions, but it could be improved with greater clarity and more specific detail based on the visual evidence. The phrase \"To his left, the right side of the framet\" is confusing; a clearer description would be \"To the right of the central man...\" or \"On the right side of the screen...\". The description of the two men on the right is also sparse. For instance, the video shows that the man in the green t-shirt has short blond hair and is unwrapping a sandwich from foil, while the man in the white collared shirt has a shaved head and is holding a fork poised over a container of pasta, which would add valuable distinguishing details. The caption mentions they \"turn their heads to look,\" but it lacks the context seen in the video, where they seem to be reacting with smiles to something the central man just said. Furthermore, while the main subject eats a salad, the video clearly shows identifiable ingredients like cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, which could be mentioned. Finally, the caption omits other objects on the counter that are part of the immediate scene, such as their smartphones and blue water bottles, which help establish the setting as a modern office breakroom.",
