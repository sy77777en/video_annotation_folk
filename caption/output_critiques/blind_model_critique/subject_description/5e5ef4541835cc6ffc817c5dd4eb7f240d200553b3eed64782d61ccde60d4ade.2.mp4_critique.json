    "pre_caption": "The video features a wolf with a thick, grayish-brown fur coat, lying on a patch of grass. The wolf is positioned in a forested area, surrounded by tall trees with green and yellow leaves. Its body is oriented to the left, with its head turned slightly in the same direction, giving a side profile view. The wolf appears calm and relaxed. As the video progresses, the wolf disappears from the frame, leaving only the grassy area and trees visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the subject as a wolf, describes its fur color as grayish-brown, its posture as lying on grass, and its orientation as a side profile. It also accurately notes that the wolf is present at the beginning and gone by the end.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It captures the main subject, its key visual attributes, and the primary event of the video (the wolf's disappearance). However, it could be more complete by describing *how* the wolf disappears (e.g., if it walks away, if there is a cut, or if it fades out), as the instructions ask to \"describe the transition in detail.\"\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption violates several explicit rules from the instructions:\n\n1.  **Forbidden Terminology:** The instruction states, \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption violates this rule by saying, \"...disappears from the **frame**...\".\n2.  **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the phrase \"calm and relaxed,\" which describes a state of being or emotion rather than an objective, observable physical attribute. A better description would focus on its posture, such as \"The wolf is lying down with its head resting on its paws.\"\n3.  **Focus on Subjects:** The instruction says, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects...\" While mentioning the grass is necessary (the wolf is on it), the description of the \"forested area, surrounded by tall trees with green and yellow leaves\" is slightly too detailed and shifts focus away from the primary subject. A more concise mention of the setting would be better.\n\nBecause the caption directly violates two negative constraints (\"don't use 'frame'\" and \"avoid subjective adjectives\"), it is not a good caption according to the provided guidelines.",
