    "pre_caption": "A man is riding a racing motorcycle on a track. He is wearing a full set of racing gear, including a blue, white, and red suit with \"Alpinestars\" branding, a matching helmet with red, white, and blue graphics, and white boots and gloves. The motorcycle is also blue, red, and white, and is covered in sponsor decals, with \"APEX\" written in large white and red letters on the side fairing, along with \"ClickCease\" and \"TRIUMPH.\" The rider is leaning low into a turn, and at one point, the motorcycle's front wheel lifts off the ground in a wheelie.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"man\" and the object he is using as a \"racing motorcycle.\" All the described visual attributes are correct: the blue, white, and red color scheme of both the suit and the motorcycle; the specific branding on the suit (\"Alpinestars\") and the motorcycle (\"APEX,\" \"ClickCease,\" \"TRIUMPH\"); and the rider's gear (helmet, boots, gloves). The description of the actions—\"leaning low into a turn\" and the front wheel lifting in a \"wheelie\"—is also a precise account of the events in the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It captures the most essential details without being overly long. It provides a full picture by describing the rider's gear and the motorcycle's appearance, including specific text details that are clearly visible. By mentioning both the turn and the wheelie, it successfully synthesizes key moments from the entire video into a single, comprehensive description. It correctly omits details that are not visible, such as the rider's face or features, adhering to the instruction to not describe what is uncertain.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in a compact format.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It centers entirely on the man and the motorcycle, their attributes, and their actions.\n*   **Synthesized Description:** It combines details from different points in the video (\"leaning into a turn\" and the \"wheelie\") into one coherent paragraph, without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Proper Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" as well as subjective adjectives.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Detail and Specificity:** It uses precise terms (\"racing motorcycle,\" \"full set of racing gear\") and provides specific visual details (colors, branding) as instructed.\n*   **Action Description:** It appropriately uses action (\"riding,\" \"leaning\") to describe the subject's state.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man is expertly maneuvering a racing motorcycle on a track, dressed in a full set of racing gear that includes a blue, white, and red suit branded with \"Alpinestars,\" a matching helmet adorned with red, white, and blue graphics, and white boots and gloves. The motorcycle mirrors this color scheme and is adorned with sponsor decals, prominently featuring \"APEX\" in large white and red letters on the side fairing, alongside \"ClickCease\" and \"TRIUMPH.\" The rider skillfully leans low into a turn, and at one point, the motorcycle's front wheel lifts off the ground in a dynamic wheelie.",
