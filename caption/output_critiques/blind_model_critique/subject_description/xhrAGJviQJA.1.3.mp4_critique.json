    "pre_caption": "A man is seen from a low-angle, point-of-view perspective while underwater, silhouetted against a bright opening to the surface from within a dark, narrow space that appears to be a cave. He is shirtless and has a muscular build. He is equipped for freediving or snorkeling, wearing a mask over his face and a snorkel tube extending upwards. One of his long fins is visible behind his head. He holds a long pole, likely a selfie stick, with both hands, pointing it down towards the camera. A watch is visible on his left wrist.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and his equipment, but it could better capture the dynamic nature of the video and the environment. The description of the man as \"silhouetted\" is slightly misleading; while the bright opening does create a strong backlight, the video clearly shows details of his face through the mask and the defined muscles of his torso and arms, illuminated by the reflected light in the water. The phrase \"Both fins alternately appear behind his head\" is awkward; in the video, his long, black fins are seen kicking powerfully behind his body, propelling him forward, and they occasionally sweep into the edges of the frame, not specifically just \"behind his head.\" The caption misses the opportunity to describe his motion—he is actively swimming forward through the cave, not just statically positioned. Furthermore, the video provides more environmental context that is omitted, such as the streams of bubbles rising from his snorkel with each breath and the beautiful sun rays piercing the water from the surface opening, creating a dramatic lighting effect on the dark, textured rock walls of the cave. A more effective caption would incorporate his forward movement and these striking visual details of the light and water.",
