    "pre_caption": "A pair of light-skinned hands, one wearing a black ribbed sweater sleeve, opens a brown cardboard shipping box. The hands, adorned with rings, lift out a smaller, light-brown product box. The product box has the brand name \"EVISTR\" and the words \"Digital Voice Recorder\" printed on it, along with a graphic of a microphone above the word \"REC.\" The hands hold the product box up, displaying its front.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the initial actions, but it feels incomplete and lacks some key specifics that would likely be present in the video. The description stops after the product box is presented, but an unboxing video would almost certainly continue to show the hands opening this second box to reveal the digital voice recorder itself; the caption should include a description of the recorder, such as its metallic gray body, small LCD screen, and button layout. Furthermore, the details provided are somewhat vague. For instance, \"adorned with rings\" could be improved by specifying the type and placement, such as \"a simple silver band on the right index finger.\" The action of opening the shipping box could also be more descriptive, clarifying if the hands tear the tape or use a box cutter. The mention of \"one wearing a black ribbed sweater sleeve\" is ambiguous; it should be clarified whether the other arm is bare or has a matching sleeve. Finally, the product box itself likely has more visual information than mentioned, such as a picture of the actual device or icons indicating features like storage capacity, which should be included for a more thorough description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A pair of light-skinned hands, one wearing a black ribbed sweater sleeve and the other with a matching sleeve, carefully uses a box cutter to slice through the tape sealing a brown cardboard shipping box. The hands, featuring a simple silver band on the right index finger, lift out a smaller, light-brown product box. This box prominently displays the brand name \"EVISTR\" and the words \"Digital Voice Recorder,\" along with a graphic of a microphone above the word \"REC.\" Additional visuals include a picture of the device and icons indicating features like storage capacity. The hands then open the product box to reveal the digital voice recorder, showcasing its sleek metallic gray body, small LCD screen, and intuitive button layout.",
