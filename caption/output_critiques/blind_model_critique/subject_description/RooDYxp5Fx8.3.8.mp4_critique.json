    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban environment. The focus is on the bustling street lined with modern buildings, showcasing a mix of architectural styles. The scene includes a variety of elements such as trees, street signs, and vehicles, contributing to the dynamic atmosphere. The presence of pedestrians and moving cars adds to the lively city vibe. The emphasis is on the overall environment and the interaction of urban elements, rather than a specific object, highlighting the scale and energy of city life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot and explains the lack of a single main subject, but it relies too heavily on subjective, atmospheric language such as \"vibrant,\" \"dynamic atmosphere,\" and \"lively city vibe,\" which the instructions advise against. It also lacks the specific visual details required. For instance, instead of a \"mix of architectural styles,\" the caption could have described the buildings I see, such as \"tall, glass-paneled skyscrapers standing alongside shorter, red-brick commercial buildings with large display windows.\" The description of \"vehicles\" and \"pedestrians\" is too generic; it could have been improved by mentioning the \"streams of yellow taxis and a few blue city buses\" or the \"dense crowds of people in dark coats and jackets moving across a wide crosswalk.\" The caption is also redundant, repeatedly stating that the focus is on the overall environment. A more effective approach would be to replace the subjective adjectives with these concrete visual facts, allowing the scene's energy to be conveyed through objective description rather than explicit interpretation, thus creating a more informative and precise summary of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a bustling urban scene, focusing on a busy street lined with tall, glass-paneled skyscrapers standing alongside shorter, red-brick commercial buildings with large display windows. The scene includes elements such as trees, street signs, and streams of yellow taxis and a few blue city buses navigating through the traffic. Dense crowds of people in dark coats and jackets move across a wide crosswalk, contributing to the vibrant energy of city life. The emphasis is on the interaction of these urban elements, highlighting the scale and activity of the environment.",
