    "pre_caption": "The video features a white egret with a long neck and slender body, standing near the edge of a water body. Its plumage is smooth and bright, and it has a distinct yellow beak. The egret is positioned close to the water, with its legs partially submerged, suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move. The setting includes grassy vegetation along the bank, providing a natural habitat for the bird. The egret's posture is attentive, with its head slightly tilted, indicating alertness or focus on its surroundings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on the instructions provided.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good, but it has a few areas where it deviates from the specific instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"white egret\" and accurately describes its key physical characteristics, such as its white plumage, long neck, slender body, and yellow beak. The description of its posture and location near water is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It provides a thorough description of the main subject, including its appearance, posture, and immediate surroundings. It successfully paints a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\n\nHere is a point-by-point analysis of how well the caption followed the rules:\n\n*   **Strengths (What the caption did well):**\n    *   **Concise and Clear:** The description is written in simple, natural English and is easy to understand.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses a precise term, \"white egret,\" instead of a vague one.\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** It effectively details the egret's key visual attributes (color, body shape, beak color) and pose (standing, legs submerged, head tilted).\n    *   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement (Where the caption deviated from instructions):**\n    1.  **Use of Interpretive Language:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\" and \"avoid subjective adjectives.\" The caption includes several interpretations rather than sticking to purely visual facts.\n        *   **Example:** \"...suggesting it is either wading or preparing to move.\"\n        *   **Correction:** A more compliant description would state the observable fact: \"Its legs are partially submerged in the water.\"\n        *   **Example:** \"The egret's posture is attentive, with its head slightly tilted, indicating alertness or focus...\"\n        *   **Correction:** \"Attentive,\" \"alertness,\" and \"focus\" are inferences about the bird's mental state. The description should be limited to the physical pose: \"The egret stands with its head slightly tilted.\"\n\n    2.  **Reference to the Medium:** The instruction advises against using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" While \"video\" isn't explicitly forbidden, the best practice for this type of descriptive task is to describe the scene directly without mentioning the medium.\n        *   **Example:** \"The video features a white egret...\"\n        *   **Correction:** The caption should begin by describing the subject directly: \"A white egret with a long neck and slender body stands near the edge of a water body.\"\n\n    3.  **Describing the Background:** The instruction allows mentioning the background if necessary for context but cautions against adding information that isn't a direct visual description.\n        *   **Example:** \"...providing a natural habitat for the bird.\"\n        *   **Correction:** This phrase explains the *function* of the environment, which is an analytical conclusion. Simply describing the visual elements, such as \"The bird is near grassy vegetation along the bank,\" is more aligned with the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is good because it is accurate and descriptive. However, to be a **perfect** caption according to the strict rules provided, it should be more objective, avoid interpreting the subject's actions or state of mind, and describe the scene directly without referencing the word \"video.\"",
