    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a majestic mountain valley under a clear, star-filled night sky. Towering, snow-covered mountains flank a dark, still body of water that reflects the celestial light. The scene is dramatically lit, with cool moonlight illuminating the rugged slopes on one side of the valley, while the other side remains in deep shadow. A small, warm artificial light in the foreground provides a subtle contrast to the vast, cold wilderness. There is no main subject; instead, the focus is on the immense scale, serene atmosphere, and breathtaking beauty of the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the scene as a mountain landscape at night but misses several key visual details and uses subjective language contrary to the instructions. While it mentions a \"star-filled night sky,\" it fails to describe the time-lapse effect visible in the video, where the stars form distinct circular trails around a central point, and the Milky Way's bright band is clearly visible moving across the frame. The \"small, warm artificial light\" is not just a generic light but emanates from a single, orange-glowing dome tent in the foreground, which serves as a clear focal point and subject, contradicting the claim that there is \"no main subject.\" The description of the water as \"still\" is also slightly inaccurate; the video shows gentle, slow-moving ripples on the lake's surface, causing the reflection of the moonlight and stars to shimmer and distort subtly. Furthermore, the caption uses subjective terms like \"majestic,\" \"dramatically lit,\" and \"breathtaking beauty,\" which should be replaced with more objective descriptions of the mountains' jagged, rocky peaks and the high-contrast lighting from the moon, which is positioned just out of the top of the frame.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a mountain valley at night, showcasing a time-lapse of stars forming circular trails around a central point, with the Milky Way's bright band moving across the frame. Snow-covered mountains with jagged, rocky peaks flank a dark lake, where gentle ripples cause the moonlight and stars to shimmer and distort on the water's surface. The scene features high-contrast lighting, with cool moonlight illuminating one side of the valley while the other remains in shadow. In the foreground, an orange-glowing dome tent serves as a focal point, providing a warm contrast to the vast, cold wilderness.",
