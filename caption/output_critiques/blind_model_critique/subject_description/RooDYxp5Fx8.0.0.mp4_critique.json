    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily by including subjective analysis and speculation instead of sticking to a purely descriptive account of the visual content.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video does indeed show a cityscape with no single main subject, the caption is accurate in its basic premise. It correctly identifies the video type as a \"cityscape scenery shot.\"\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is overly complete, going beyond the required visual description. It adds an analytical layer about the shot's cinematic purpose (\"likely serves as an establishing shot\"), which is an inference, not a direct observation. The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does correctly:**\n*   **Identifies Scenery Type:** It correctly follows the instruction for scenery shots by stating it is a \"cityscape scenery shot.\"\n*   **Explains Lack of Subject:** It adheres to the rule to \"briefly explain why there is no main subject\" by noting, \"The focus is on the urban environment... rather than a specific object or person.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails (Violations):**\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The use of the word **\"vibe\"** is subjective and interpretive, describing a feeling rather than a visual attribute.\n*   **Violation of Describing Only the Visible:** The instruction is very clear: \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The phrase **\"likely serves as an establishing shot\"** is a major violation. This is a speculative analysis of the video's function within a larger narrative, which is not visible in the clip itself. The description should focus only on what is seen.\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** The final sentence is redundant and overly analytical. The core information was already provided in the first two sentences. The instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative description,\" but the analysis of the shot's purpose and its effect (\"setting the scene and providing context\") makes it less concise and more of a film critique.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption starts correctly by identifying the video as a scenery shot but then deviates significantly from the core instructions by introducing subjective language (\"vibe\") and speculative analysis (\"establishing shot\"). A good caption would have stopped after describing the focus on the urban environment, architecture, and street activity, omitting any interpretation of the shot's purpose or feel.\n\n**A better, compliant caption would be:**\n\n\"This is a cityscape scenery shot. The focus is on the urban environment, capturing the architecture and street activity of the area rather than a specific person or object.\"",
