    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with a medium-dark skin tone, wearing a large, light-colored hat and distinctive white, oversized sunglasses. He has long dreadlocks and a gray beard. His attire includes a green jacket over a colorful, patterned shirt, accessorized with layered necklaces. The man appears to be in a dimly lit indoor setting with vibrant, warm lighting and decorative elements like hanging flags and neon signs. His expression is neutral, and he is oriented slightly to the side, suggesting a casual or relaxed demeanor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the man and his key features like the hat, sunglasses, and dreadlocks, it describes him in a static manner, more like a photograph than a video. The description lacks any mention of his actions or movements; for instance, it doesn't specify if he is speaking, listening, looking around the room, or gesturing with his hands, which would provide crucial dynamic context. The description of his clothing and accessories is also too general; \"light-colored hat\" could be specified as a \"beige fedora,\" and the \"colorful, patterned shirt\" could be detailed with its specific pattern, such as \"a floral pattern with red and yellow flowers.\" Furthermore, the caption violates the instructions by using the subjective adjective \"distinctive\" for the sunglasses and by dedicating a full sentence to the background, which detracts from the primary subject. A better approach would be to integrate the effect of the lighting on the subject, such as noting how the neon light reflects off his oversized sunglasses, and to describe the physical posture or subtle movements—like a slow nod or a relaxed slump in his shoulders—that lead to the inference of a \"relaxed demeanor,\" making the description more objective and video-centric.",

He appears relaxed, occasionally nodding slowly and gesturing subtly with his hands, as if engaged in a conversation or listening intently.",
