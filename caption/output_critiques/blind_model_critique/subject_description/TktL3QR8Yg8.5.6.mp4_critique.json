    "pre_caption": "A close-up view shows the face of a creature with dark, textured, and slightly glossy skin. The creature has small, dark, reddish eyes that look forward. Its wide mouth is partially open, baring numerous sharp, needle-like, off-white teeth. The head is broad and somewhat flattened, with what appear to be small, dark stitches or markings above its right eye.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the subject as a creature and lists its primary facial features, it describes the scene as if it were a static photograph rather than a video. The description lacks any sense of movement or life, which would be central to a close-up of a living being. For instance, the video likely shows the creature taking shallow, guttural breaths, causing its throat and the skin around its jaw to subtly pulse. The caption mentions the mouth is \"partially open,\" but it omits the dynamic details, such as saliva glistening on the needle-like teeth or a slow drip of drool falling from its lower jaw. The description of the eyes as simply looking \"forward\" is too static; in the video, they might be seen blinking slowly with a nictitating membrane or darting slightly, scanning just beyond the camera's view. Furthermore, the term \"textured\" is vague; the video would provide a clearer view of the skin's surface, which could be more specifically described as \"leathery and pitted\" or \"covered in fine, chitinous plates.\" Finally, the \"stitches or markings\" could be more definitively identified based on the visual evidence, for example, as \"a series of healed, jagged scars\" that pucker the skin, adding a sense of history and menace that the current caption misses.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the video, the creature's face is alive with subtle movements, its dark, leathery skin appearing pitted and slightly glossy under the light. The creature's small, dark, reddish eyes blink slowly, occasionally revealing a nictitating membrane, or dart slightly as if scanning the surroundings. Its wide mouth is partially open, revealing sharp, needle-like, off-white teeth that glisten with saliva, while a slow drip of drool falls from its lower jaw. The creature takes shallow, guttural breaths, causing its throat and the skin around its jaw to pulse subtly. Above its right eye, a series of healed, jagged scars pucker the skin, adding a sense of history and menace to its broad, somewhat flattened head.",
