  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It correctly identifies the video type and follows the specific instructions for describing a scenery shot, but it fails on one critical point.\n\n### Accuracy:\nAssuming the video is indeed a landscape shot of a forest with no specific subjects, the caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and accurately states that the focus is on the \"natural environment,\" \"atmosphere,\" and \"scale.\"\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is complete according to the special instructions for scenery shots. It specifies the type of scenery and provides a clear explanation for the absence of a main subject, which is exactly what the instructions require for this type of video.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction:\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Clarity:** It is concise and clearly communicates the nature of the video.\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly follows the rule for scenery shots by stating the type (\"landscape scenery shot\") and explaining why there is no main subject (\"The focus is on the natural environment...\").\n*   **Forbidden Words:** It successfully avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**What the caption does wrong:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates a key negative constraint: **\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"** The words **\"beauty\"** and **\"tranquility\"** are subjective and convey an emotional or aesthetic judgment about the scene. A more compliant caption would describe the scene's elements factually, allowing the viewer to infer its qualities. For example, instead of \"tranquility,\" it could describe a lack of movement or sound if that were observable.\n\nIn summary, the caption's structure and its adherence to the scenery shot protocol are excellent. However, its use of the subjective words \"beauty\" and \"tranquility\" is a clear violation of the instructions and is the main area for improvement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a landscape scenery shot focusing on the natural environment, highlighting the forest's atmosphere and scale. There is no main subject, as the emphasis is on the overall features of the forest setting, such as the dense trees and expansive greenery.",
