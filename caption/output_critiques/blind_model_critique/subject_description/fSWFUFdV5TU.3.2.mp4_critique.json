    "pre_caption": "The video features a young man with curly dark hair, captured in close-up. He has a focused expression, with his eyes wide open, suggesting attentiveness or surprise. The lighting changes from a warm tone to a red hue, highlighting his facial features and casting shadows that emphasize his expression. He appears to be wearing a dark-colored top, and his face is slightly tilted, adding to the intensity of his gaze.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is accurate in its description of the video's content. It correctly identifies a young man with curly dark hair, a dark top, and a tilted face. It also accurately notes the significant change in lighting from a warm tone to a red one.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is mostly complete. It successfully captures the primary subject and the most significant visual event (the lighting change). It provides key attributes like hairstyle, clothing color, and pose. However, it could be slightly more complete by including the subject's skin tone if it is clearly discernible.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a concise, single paragraph and avoids using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the subject type (\"young man\") and describes his visual attributes (hair, clothing).\n    *   It successfully describes a key change over time (the lighting transition) without referring to specific frames, which is excellent adherence to the instructions.\n    *   The language is simple and natural.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives/Speculation\":** The most significant issue is the use of subjective and interpretive language. The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n        *   The phrase \"**suggesting attentiveness or surprise**\" is a direct violation. It speculates on the man's internal emotional state rather than describing the physical appearance of his expression.\n        *   The phrase \"**intensity of his gaze**\" is also subjective. A more objective description would focus on the physical facts, such as \"his eyes are wide and directed forward.\"\n    *   **Cinematographic Language:** The phrase \"**captured in close-up**\" describes the filmmaking technique rather than the subject itself. While not a major error, the instructions guide the writer to focus on describing the subjects within the scene. The close-up nature is already implied by the level of detail provided about the man's face.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It follows many of the core instructions regarding format, conciseness, and describing visual attributes over time. However, it fails on the critical instruction to avoid subjective interpretation and speculation about the subject's emotions or internal state. To be fully compliant, the caption should be revised to remove phrases like \"suggesting attentiveness or surprise\" and \"intensity of his gaze,\" replacing them with purely descriptive observations of the man's facial features.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a young man with curly dark hair, shown in close detail. He has a focused expression, with his eyes wide open, indicating attentiveness. The lighting changes from a warm tone to a red hue, highlighting his facial features and casting shadows that emphasize his expression. He appears to be wearing a dark-colored top, and his face is slightly tilted, enhancing the directness of his gaze. His skin tone is light, adding contrast to the changing lighting.",
