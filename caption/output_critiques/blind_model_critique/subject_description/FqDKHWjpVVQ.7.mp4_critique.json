    "pre_caption": "From a first-person viewpoint, a black, boxy firearm is held, pointing forward. On the ground to the left, a person in military-style camouflage lies on their back. A graphical overlay is present, featuring a small, square map with blue and green icons in the lower-left corner. In the lower-right corner, a display shows blue bars and white numbers, including \"87 / 101\". Orange, diamond-shaped markers with numbers are also visible toward the center of the view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good, objective breakdown of the on-screen elements, but it lacks the specific context and terminology that would make it truly informative for this type of content. For instance, the \"person in military-style camouflage\" is likely a downed teammate, which would be visually indicated by a blue icon or name tag above them; specifying this relationship is crucial to understanding the player's actions. The \"black, boxy firearm\" could be described with more detail, as it likely has visible attachments like a holographic sight or a suppressor that are key visual features. While the description of the graphical overlay is accurate, it could be more confident in its interpretation; the numbers \"87 / 101\" almost certainly represent the ammunition count (bullets in the magazine versus total reserve), and the orange, diamond-shaped markers are standard enemy pings, with the numbers inside indicating their distance in meters. Finally, the caption misses an opportunity to describe the state of the scene; for example, the firearm might be smoking slightly after being fired, or the central blue text might be a pop-up that reads \"+100 ELIMINATED,\" providing a clearer narrative of the action that just occurred before the pan.",
