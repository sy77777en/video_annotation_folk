    "pre_caption": "The video features two stylized, pixelated flamingos with glowing white and blue hues, standing in shallow water. Their bodies are illuminated, creating a striking contrast against the dark surroundings. The flamingos are positioned side by side, with one slightly ahead of the other, both facing to the right. Their long necks are gracefully curved, and they stand on thin legs, each on a small, glowing platform. The scene has a digital, retro aesthetic, emphasizing the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the flamingos.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but has a few clear violations of the instructions. It is strong in accuracy and completeness but fails on some key formatting and content rules.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"two stylized, pixelated flamingos\" and accurately describes their key visual attributes, such as their \"glowing white and blue hues,\" their illuminated bodies, their posture (\"standing,\" \"side by side,\" \"facing to the right\"), and their \"long necks\" and \"thin legs.\" The detail about them standing on \"small, glowing platform[s]\" is also a correct and valuable observation.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It successfully captures all the essential visual information about the subjects in the video. It provides a comprehensive picture by detailing not just the subjects themselves but also their specific design (pixelated), color, lighting effect (glowing), and their spatial relationship to each other (\"one slightly ahead of the other\").\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThis is where the caption has several issues.\n\n*   **Violation:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is explicitly forbidden by the rule: \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"\n*   **Violation:** The caption uses subjective or interpretive language. The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" While not strictly emotional, words like \"gracefully curved\" and \"striking contrast\" are subjective interpretations of the visual form and impact. A more neutral description would be \"Their long necks are curved\" and \"Their illuminated bodies contrast with the dark surroundings.\"\n*   **Violation:** The final sentence, \"The scene has a digital, retro aesthetic, emphasizing the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the flamingos,\" moves from describing the subjects to interpreting the overall artistic style (\"retro aesthetic\"). The instruction is to focus on describing the subjects' visual attributes, and this sentence is a summary of the overall mood and style, which is outside the scope of the prompt. It is also redundant, as \"pixelated design\" was already mentioned.\n*   **Minor Deviation:** The caption mentions the \"shallow water\" and \"dark surroundings.\" The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" In this case, mentioning the dark surroundings is justifiable as it's essential for describing the key attribute of the subjects being \"illuminated\" and creating \"contrast.\" Mentioning the \"shallow water\" provides necessary context for flamingos. Therefore, this is an acceptable deviation.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that follows all the instructions:\n\nTwo stylized, pixelated flamingos with glowing white and blue hues stand in shallow water. Their bodies are illuminated, creating a contrast with the dark surroundings. The flamingos are positioned side by side, with one slightly ahead of the other, and both face to the right. They have long, curved necks and stand on thin legs, each on a small, glowing platform.",
