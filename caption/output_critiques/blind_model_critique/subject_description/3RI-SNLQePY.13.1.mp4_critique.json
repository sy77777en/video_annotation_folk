    "pre_caption": "The video features two stylized, pixelated flamingos with glowing white and blue hues, standing in shallow water. Their bodies are illuminated, creating a striking contrast against the dark surroundings. The flamingos are positioned side by side, with one slightly ahead of the other, both facing to the right. Their long necks are gracefully curved, and they stand on thin legs, each on a small, glowing platform. The scene has a digital, retro aesthetic, emphasizing the vibrant colors and pixelated design of the flamingos.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two pixelated cranes and the small creature, it misses key details about their animation and the environment that are central to the video's action and atmosphere. The description of the crane turning is too simple; it fails to mention that the turn is not smooth but happens in a distinct, three-frame, jerky animation that reinforces the retro, pixelated style. The caption also omits that the cranes' blue and white glowing parts are not static but pulse with a slow, rhythmic beat, and their reflections are visible in the dark water, which ripples slightly as the small creature moves. The \"light-colored blob\" is more specifically a small, round, white creature with two large black eyes, and its movement is not just \"jumping\" but a distinct animation where it compresses into a flat oval before springing upwards, landing with a small splash effect. Furthermore, the \"underground or cave-like setting\" is more detailed, featuring dark purple, pixelated rock formations and glowing blue veins running through the walls, which the creature seems to be following. The caption also fails to note the interaction, or lack thereof, between the subjects; the cranes remain completely still and seemingly unaware as the creature navigates the environment, suggesting they are part of the scenery rather than active participants. Lastly, the use of \"gracefully\" is subjective; a more objective description would be that their necks form a distinct S-shaped curve.",
