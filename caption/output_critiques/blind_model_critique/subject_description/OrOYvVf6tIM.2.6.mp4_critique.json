    "pre_caption": "The video features a large, open cardboard box with flaps spread outward, positioned centrally. The box is made of brown corrugated cardboard, and its interior appears dark, suggesting depth. The flaps are slightly bent, indicating they have been opened. The lighting creates a subtle sheen on the box's surface, highlighting its texture. The box remains stationary throughout the video, with no visible changes or additional subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It successfully follows all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a single, static subject—a cardboard box—which is a plausible scenario for a video. It accurately details its visual characteristics: it's open, brown, corrugated, and centrally positioned. The description of the dark interior, bent flaps, and the sheen from the lighting are all precise and believable visual details.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete for such a simple subject. It covers:\n*   **Subject Type:** \"large, open cardboard box\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** \"brown corrugated cardboard,\" \"flaps spread outward,\" \"interior appears dark,\" \"flaps are slightly bent,\" \"subtle sheen on the box's surface.\"\n*   **Position:** \"positioned centrally.\"\n*   **State/Action:** \"open,\" \"stationary throughout the video.\"\n*   **Context:** It correctly notes the absence of other subjects or changes, which is crucial for a complete description of a static video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption meticulously follows every rule in the instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full picture of the video's content in a short, clear paragraph.\n*   **Focus on the Subject:** The entire description is dedicated to the box, without mentioning the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** While it uses phrases like \"suggesting depth\" and \"indicating they have been opened,\" these are direct, logical inferences based on visual evidence (\"dark interior,\" \"bent flaps\") and not unsupported guesses. This aligns with the goal of creating a natural description.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive adjectives (\"large,\" \"brown,\" \"dark\") rather than subjective or emotional ones (\"sad,\" \"beautiful\").\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Clarity and Precision:** It uses the precise term \"cardboard box\" and describes its attributes with specific language (\"corrugated,\" \"flaps spread outward\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a large, open cardboard box with outward-spread flaps, centrally positioned. Made of brown corrugated cardboard, the box's interior appears dark, hinting at its depth. The slightly bent flaps suggest they have been opened, and the lighting casts a subtle sheen on the box's surface, accentuating its texture. The box remains stationary throughout the video, with no visible changes or additional elements.",
