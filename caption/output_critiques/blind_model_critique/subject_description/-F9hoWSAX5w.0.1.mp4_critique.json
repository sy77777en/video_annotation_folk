    "pre_caption": "The video features a man standing near a row of subway turnstiles. He is wearing a long, dark coat and a hat, with his back turned slightly towards the camera. The man appears to be interacting with the turnstile, possibly preparing to pass through. The setting is a subway station, indicated by the signage for the \"Red Line trains\" above the turnstiles. The lighting is dim, casting shadows around the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Speculation\":** The most significant error is the use of speculative language. The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption includes phrases like \"appears to be interacting\" and \"possibly preparing to pass through,\" which are interpretations of the man's intent rather than descriptions of his visible actions. A better caption would state only what is observable, such as \"A man... stands in front of a turnstile.\"\n\n*   **Violation of \"Focus on Subjects\":** The instructions state to \"avoid describing the background or motion unless it's necessary.\" While the turnstiles are a key object the man is near, the caption goes further by describing the general setting (\"a subway station\"), specific signage (\"Red Line trains\"), and atmospheric lighting (\"The lighting is dim, casting shadows around the area\"). These details shift the focus from the subject to the environment, which contradicts the primary instruction.\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Introductory Text\":** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is an introductory phrase. The instructions clearly demand to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The description should start directly with the subject (e.g., \"A man stands...\").\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the subject and uses simple language, it fails on the critical points of avoiding speculation, maintaining a strict focus on the subject over the background, and omitting introductory phrases.",
