    "pre_caption": "The video features several small, white, pixelated creatures with simple, blocky forms. One creature, positioned on a high platform, is distinguished by a small, raised feature on its head, resembling a hat or a tuft of hair. Another similar white creature is partially visible inside a recess in a vertical, grassy structure. A third creature, identical in its simple white form to the second, stands on a ledge on a separate vertical structure. All the creatures are rendered in a minimalist pixel art style, lacking detailed facial features or limbs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the minimalist, pixel-art style of the small, white creatures and their general placement. However, it completely omits the primary subject of the video: a player-controlled character, a small figure in a blue jumpsuit, who is actively jumping between the platforms where these creatures are located. The white creatures are secondary, appearing more like collectibles or non-player characters that the main character is moving towards. The description of the creature with a \"hat or a tuft of hair\" is too ambiguous; in the video, it is clearly a single, distinct red pixel that serves as a cap, likely signifying it as a special or unique variant. Furthermore, the caption portrays the creatures as static, whereas they have a subtle, continuous bobbing animation, making them feel more alive. While it correctly states they lack detailed features, it fails to mention their most prominent characteristic besides their color: two simple black pixel dots for eyes, which gives them a distinct, ghost-like quality. Describing these creatures in relation to the main character's actions would provide a much more accurate and contextually rich depiction of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a player-controlled character, a small figure in a blue jumpsuit, actively jumping between platforms. The main character navigates towards several small, white, pixelated creatures that resemble collectibles or non-player characters.

One creature, positioned on a high platform, is distinguished by a single red pixel on its head, resembling a cap and indicating it as a special variant. Another creature is partially visible inside a recess in a vertical, grassy structure, while a third stands on a ledge on a separate vertical structure. The dynamic interaction between the main character and these lively creatures forms the core of the video.",
