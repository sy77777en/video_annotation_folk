    "pre_caption": "The video features several small, white, pixelated creatures with simple, blocky forms. One creature, positioned on a high platform, is distinguished by a small, raised feature on its head, resembling a hat or a tuft of hair. Another similar white creature is partially visible inside a recess in a vertical, grassy structure. A third creature, identical in its simple white form to the second, stands on a ledge on a separate vertical structure. All the creatures are rendered in a minimalist pixel art style, lacking detailed facial features or limbs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres exceptionally well to all the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"creatures\" and uses precise, objective language (\"small, white, pixelated,\" \"blocky forms\") to describe their appearance. The way it handles the ambiguous feature on the first creature—\"resembling a hat or a tuft of hair\"—is a perfect example of describing what is visible without making unverified assumptions.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive. It successfully identifies and describes all three distinct creatures, noting their shared characteristics and what makes each one unique. It provides a full picture of the subjects present in the video by synthesizing details about their appearance and placement.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, clear, and coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the subjects, describing their type and visual attributes in detail.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids forbidden words like \"image\" and \"frame.\" It mentions background elements (\"vertical, grassy structure\") only to provide necessary context for the subjects' locations, which is explicitly allowed by the instructions.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It uses descriptive, non-subjective adjectives, successfully avoiding any emotional language.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** The caption excels at distinguishing between the multiple similar subjects by using a combination of location (\"on a high platform,\" \"inside a recess,\" \"on a ledge\") and unique visual attributes (\"distinguished by a small, raised feature on its head\").\n    *   **Structure:** The order of description is logical, starting with the most distinct creature before moving to the others, which aligns with the prioritization guidelines.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, objective, and well-structured, providing a clear and thorough description of the video's subjects.",
