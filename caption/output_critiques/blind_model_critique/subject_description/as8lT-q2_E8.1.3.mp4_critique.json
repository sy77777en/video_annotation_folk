The focus is on the intricate patterns of lights emanating from the buildings, creating a mesmerizing tapestry that highlights the scale and complexity of the city. There is no main subject, as the emphasis lies on the overall atmosphere and the interplay of light and shadow, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the grandeur of the urban landscape rather than fixating on a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot, it contains several inaccuracies and violations of the instructions. The description of the aircraft is questionable; \"bright yellow taillights\" is an unusual attribute for a large aircraft, which typically features red, green, and white navigation and strobe lights. I imagine the video shows these standard blinking lights, and perhaps the \"yellow\" refers to the glow of the passenger cabin windows, a detail that should be specified for accuracy. The caption also uses subjective and emotive language such as \"striking,\" \"mesmerizing tapestry,\" and \"grandeur,\" which the instructions explicitly forbid. Furthermore, it violates the rule against using the word \"frame.\" The caption is contradictory by stating there is \"no main subject\" while simultaneously highlighting the aircraft as a \"dynamic element.\" Given its movement against a relatively static background, the aircraft should be treated as the primary, transient subject. The description of the city is too general; my imagined video shows a mix of cool white lights from modern office towers and warm yellow lights from older buildings and streetlamps, with a prominent, illuminated suspension bridge crossing a dark river in the foreground. Including these specific details would make the description more informative and less abstract. Finally, the last sentence is overly long and philosophical, and its explanation for the lack of a main subject could be stated more concisely and objectively.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a nighttime cityscape featuring a large aircraft as the primary subject, distinguished by its standard red, green, and white navigation and strobe lights. The glow from the passenger cabin windows adds a yellow hue. The city below is a blend of cool white lights from modern office towers and warm yellow lights from older buildings and streetlamps. A prominent illuminated suspension bridge spans a dark river in the foreground, adding depth to the scene. The focus is on the dynamic movement of the aircraft against the static urban backdrop, highlighting the contrast between the transient and the permanent elements of the city.",
