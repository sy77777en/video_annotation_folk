    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior scenery shot that transitions from an enclosed space to an open one. The focus is on the environment and the unsettling atmosphere it creates, rather than on a specific subject, an effect heightened by the first-person perspective. The sequence begins inside a dark, reddish-brown, enclosed water slide tube, looking toward a small circle of light. It then emerges from the slide's red-rimmed exit into a starkly lit, institutional-looking pool room. The room features white tiled walls, a pool of murky greenish water, and a simple metal railing along a set of stairs in the background, all contributing to a sense of eerie emptiness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the video's content. It correctly identifies the sequence of events: a first-person perspective moving through a dark, reddish-brown water slide tube and emerging into a brightly lit room with a pool, white tiled walls, and a metal railing. The visual details mentioned (murky water, red-rimmed exit) are correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It successfully describes the entire visual sequence from start to finish, combining details from the whole video into a coherent narrative. It correctly identifies the scene as a scenery shot and describes its main components.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails to follow the instructions in several critical ways:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective and Emotional Language:** The most significant violation is the use of subjective adjectives that convey emotion and interpretation. The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption includes:\n    *   \"unsettling atmosphere\"\n    *   \"institutional-looking\"\n    *   \"eerie emptiness\"\n    These words describe a feeling or an interpretation of the scene, not its objective visual attributes. A word like \"starkly\" also leans toward interpretation, whereas \"brightly\" would be more objective.\n\n2.  **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The instruction states to return \"only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown or introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"This video presents...\", which is a form of introductory text.\n\n3.  **Inclusion of Analysis:** The caption includes analytical or interpretive statements rather than just describing what is visible. For example, \"...an effect heightened by the first-person perspective\" and \"...all contributing to a sense of eerie emptiness\" are analyses of filmmaking technique and its intended impact, not direct visual descriptions.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the video's content, it is fundamentally flawed because it heavily relies on subjective, emotional, and interpretive language, directly contradicting the core requirements of the instructions.",
