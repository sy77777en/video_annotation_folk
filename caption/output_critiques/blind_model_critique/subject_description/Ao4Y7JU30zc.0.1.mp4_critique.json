    "pre_caption": "A man is shown in a dark, heavily silhouetted profile shot. A bright light source from behind and to the left illuminates the outline of his head, shoulders, and hands, while the rest of his form is cast in deep shadow. His head is bowed forward, and his hands are clasped together in front of his mouth. Due to the dramatic lighting, his facial features, expression, and clothing are not visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and serves as a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres meticulously to the rules.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately describes a scene dominated by a strong silhouette. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"man\" and precisely details the visual information available: the outline of his head, shoulders, and hands, created by a bright backlight.\n*   It is also accurate in what it omits, correctly stating that features, expression, and clothing are not visible, which is true for a heavy silhouette.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete. It covers the subject's type (\"man\"), pose (\"head is bowed forward,\" \"hands are clasped together in front of his mouth\"), and the specific lighting conditions that define the entire visual (\"dark, heavily silhouetted,\" \"bright light source from behind and to the left\").\n*   By explicitly mentioning what is *not* visible, it provides a comprehensive understanding of the scene without resorting to speculation, which is a key requirement.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and highly informative. The language is simple and natural.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the main subject (the man) and his key visual attributes (his silhouetted form and pose).\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption excels here. Instead of guessing the man's mood or the reason for his pose, it objectively states that his expression is not visible due to the lighting. This is a perfect execution of the rule \"avoid describing what is not visible.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption successfully avoids subjective adjectives that convey emotion. While \"dramatic lighting\" could be seen as borderline subjective, in a visual arts context, it is a common and descriptive term for high-contrast lighting (chiaroscuro) and does not impute emotion onto the subject. It correctly avoids words like \"sad,\" \"pensive,\" or \"prayerful.\"\n*   **Formatting and Forbidden Words:** It correctly returns only the one-paragraph description without any introductory text or Markdown. It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is exceptionally well-written and perfectly aligns with all the given constraints. It demonstrates a clear understanding of how to describe a visual scene objectively, focusing on what is present and explicitly noting what is obscured, resulting in a description that is both precise and easy to visualize.",
