    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with long, straight hair, partially visible on the left side. She is wearing a light-colored garment. The lighting is dim, with a bright light source behind her, creating a silhouette effect. The focus is on her face, suggesting the use of face tracking and projection mapping technology, as indicated by the text overlay. The setting appears to be a studio environment, with equipment visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its failures regarding accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption is mostly accurate in its description of the primary subject: a partially visible woman with long hair, wearing a light-colored garment, and appearing as a silhouette.\n*   However, it makes a significant and inaccurate leap by stating that the video suggests \"the use of face tracking and projection mapping technology, as indicated by the text overlay.\" This is a major violation. The instructions require describing only what is visually present in the scene, not interpreting on-screen graphics or speculating about the technology used to create the video. The \"text overlay\" is part of the video's presentation, not a subject within the scene itself.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The description of the woman is minimal. While the lighting might obscure details, the caption could be more specific about her pose or the parts of her that are visible (e.g., \"a woman seen in profile from the shoulders up\").\n*   The primary issue is not what's missing, but what has been incorrectly included (speculation, background details, and interpretation of text overlays).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the following specific instructions:\n\n1.  **\"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** The caption explicitly describes the background as a \"studio environment, with equipment visible in the background.\" This is unnecessary as there is only one subject and no need to use the background for context or distinction.\n\n2.  **\"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** The caption speculates about technology (\"face tracking and projection mapping\") and uses uncertain language (\"suggesting,\" \"appears to be\"). This is inferential and goes against the rule of describing only what is certain and visible.\n\n3.  **\"Focus on subject types and visual attributes.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** The caption diverts focus from the subject to describe lighting techniques (\"bright light source behind her, creating a silhouette effect\"), the setting (\"studio environment\"), and non-subject elements (\"text overlay\"). The instruction is to describe the subject's visual attributes, not the production techniques or on-screen graphics.\n\n4.  **\"Keep the description concise and clear.\"**\n    *   **Violation:** By including unnecessary details about the background and speculative information about technology, the caption loses its conciseness and focus on the essential visual information of the subject.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it speculates, describes the background unnecessarily, and interprets non-subject elements like text overlays, all of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. A correct caption would focus solely on the visual description of the woman.",
