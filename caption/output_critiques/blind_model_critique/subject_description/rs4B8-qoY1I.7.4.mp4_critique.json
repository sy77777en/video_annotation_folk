    "pre_caption": "A male warrior character, clad in a silver-colored chest plate, a helmet, and red pants while wielding a sword, is depicted with a semi-transparent, ghostly duplicate of himself slightly offset from his body. He is surrounded by humanoid skeletons, some of which are intact while others are reduced to piles of bones on the stone floor. The most prominent atypical feature is a large, rectangular, semi-transparent overlay that covers the central portion of the scene, causing the warrior, the skeletons, and the stone dungeon architecture to appear faded and ethereal, as if viewed through a ghostly veil.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central warrior character and the surrounding skeletons, it lacks the specific visual detail and dynamic context likely present in the video. The description of the warrior's attire as a \"red and silver top\" is too generic; a more accurate description might be \"ornate silver plate armor with red cloth accents.\" Similarly, the helmet and sword could be described with more specificity, such as \"a full-face, horned helmet\" and \"a single-edged longsword glowing with a faint blue light,\" which would better capture the fantasy aesthetic. The caption presents the scene as static, but a video would show action; describing the warrior's pose, such as being in a \"low defensive stance,\" and the skeletons' actions, like \"shambling forward with rusted axes and broken shields,\" is crucial for conveying the conflict. Furthermore, the \"large, rectangular overlay\" is almost certainly a video game's user interface (UI), and it should be described as such, noting key elements like \"a health bar, a compass, and several ability icons,\" rather than just its shape. Finally, the description misses key atmospheric details like the setting, which could be a \"dimly lit stone dungeon,\" with the light source casting long, dynamic shadows that add to the scene's tension.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An ornate silver plate-armored warrior with red cloth accents stands in a dimly lit stone dungeon, wielding a single-edged longsword that glows with a faint blue light. His full-face, horned helmet adds to his imposing presence. In a low defensive stance, he faces a horde of humanoid skeletons, some shambling forward with rusted axes and broken shields, while others lie in piles of bones on the stone floor. A semi-transparent, ghostly duplicate of the warrior is slightly offset from his body, enhancing the fantasy aesthetic. The scene is overlaid with a video game user interface, featuring a health bar, a compass, and several ability icons, which adds to the dynamic context. The dim lighting casts long, dynamic shadows, heightening the tension and ethereal atmosphere of the dungeon.",
