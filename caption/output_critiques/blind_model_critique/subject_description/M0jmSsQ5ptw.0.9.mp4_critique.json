    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects (a chainsaw and a wooden beam) and the central action (cutting). The details provided, such as the \"moving, toothed chain,\" \"light-colored wooden beam,\" \"dark vertical supports,\" \"splintering,\" and \"sawdust,\" are all precise and factually descriptive of what one would expect to see in such a video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It doesn't just describe a static scene but effectively summarizes the entire process shown in the video. It starts with the tool and the material, describes the action of cutting, and concludes with the results of that action (splintering, separation, sawdust). This successfully fulfills the instruction to \"describe the video by combining details from the frames.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions with remarkable precision:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is packed with relevant detail without being overly long.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the chainsaw and the wood as the main subjects.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Necessary Motion:** The description of motion (\"moving, toothed chain,\" \"cuts vertically,\" \"sawdust flying\") is essential for understanding the video's content and is therefore used appropriately.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption avoids subjective adjectives. Words like \"light-colored,\" \"jagged,\" and \"vertical\" are purely descriptive.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses clear terms like \"chainsaw\" and \"wooden beam.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It excels here, providing details like \"toothed chain,\" \"light-colored,\" \"horizontal,\" and \"dark vertical supports.\"\n*   **Coherent Paragraph:** The caption is a single, well-structured, and easy-to-read paragraph.\n\n### Point for Consideration\nThe only minor point that could be debated is the opening phrase, \"From a first-person, wide-angle perspective...\" While this is an accurate and helpful observation, the instructions state to focus on \"subject types and visual attributes\" and to \"avoid describing what is not visible.\" The camera's perspective is a cinematographic choice rather than a tangible subject within the scene. A stricter interpretation of the rules might omit this detail to focus exclusively on the objects and their interactions.\n\nHowever, this is a very minor critique. The inclusion of the perspective adds valuable context without detracting from the core description.\n\n### Conclusion\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, detailed, objective, and accurately captures the essence of the video in a single, coherent paragraph. The minor point regarding the camera perspective is negligible compared to its overall high quality.",
