    "pre_caption": "The video features a person wearing a dark, full-body spacesuit with a helmet, standing in a futuristic, metallic environment. The suit has distinct light-colored stripes and padding, suggesting a design for protection or specialized activity. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, slightly leaning forward with arms extended, possibly indicating movement or interaction with the surroundings. The setting is characterized by vertical and horizontal lines, contributing to a high-tech, industrial atmosphere. The lighting is dim, with reflections on the surfaces, enhancing the sleek and modern aesthetic.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### 1. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates three core negative constraints from the instructions:\n\n*   **Describing the Background:** The instructions state, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" Since there is only one subject, describing the background is unnecessary. The caption dedicates almost half of its content to the setting (\"futuristic, metallic environment,\" \"vertical and horizontal lines,\" \"dim lighting,\" \"reflections\"), which is a direct violation.\n*   **Using Subjective and Interpretive Language:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" This rule extends to aesthetic judgments. The caption uses numerous subjective terms like \"futuristic,\" \"high-tech,\" \"industrial atmosphere,\" and \"sleek and modern aesthetic.\" These are interpretations, not objective descriptions of visual attributes.\n*   **Describing Uncertainties:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption includes speculative phrases such as \"...**suggesting** a design for protection or specialized activity\" and \"...**possibly indicating** movement or interaction with the surroundings.\" This is conjecture about the subject's purpose and intent, not a description of what is visually present.\n\n### 2. Accuracy\n\nAssuming the visual details are correct, the description of the subject itself is mostly accurate. It correctly identifies a person in a spacesuit and describes its color, features (stripes, padding), and the person's pose (standing, back to viewer, leaning forward, arms extended). However, the accuracy is compromised by the inclusion of subjective and speculative information.\n\n### 3. Completeness\n\nThe description of the primary subject is reasonably complete, covering its type, attire, and posture. However, the space wasted on the forbidden background description and speculation could have been used to provide more objective detail about the suit or the person, if any were available.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nA better caption that adheres to the instructions would be:\n\n\"A person stands wearing a dark, full-body suit and a helmet. The suit features light-colored stripes and padded sections. The person is oriented with their back to the viewer, leaning slightly forward with both arms extended forward.\"",
