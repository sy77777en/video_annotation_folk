    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a close-up of a yellow and black Nike soccer ball, covered in water droplets, resting on green artificial turf. The ball has the word \"STRIKE\" and a black Nike swoosh visible. A red Nike soccer cleat with a silver swoosh then enters the frame and kicks the ball in slow motion, causing the water to splash dramatically. The focus then shifts to the person's feet, showing a pair of the red cleats and black socks. One foot is planted on the ground while the other, the kicking foot, is suspended in the air after the follow-through.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good, but it has a few minor issues that prevent it from being perfect.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects: a \"yellow and black Nike soccer ball\" and \"red Nike soccer cleats.\" It also accurately describes their key visual attributes, such as the water droplets, the \"STRIKE\" text, the Nike swooshes on both the ball and the cleats, and the \"green artificial turf.\" The description of the action—a slow-motion kick causing water to splash, followed by a shot of the feet in a follow-through pose—is also precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully synthesizes the entire sequence of the video into a coherent narrative. It covers the initial state of the ball, the introduction of the cleat, the central action of the kick, and the final pose, leaving out no essential details.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThis is where the caption has minor flaws.\n\n*   **Good Adherence:**\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph.\n    *   It uses simple, natural English.\n    *   It correctly identifies subject types (\"soccer ball,\" \"soccer cleat\").\n    *   It describes the subjects in the order they appear, which is appropriate for this video.\n    *   It correctly describes the shift in focus without using technical jargon.\n\n*   **Violations:**\n    *   **Use of \"frame\":** The instruction explicitly states, \"...avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption violates this by saying, \"...enters the **frame**...\"\n    *   **Use of a subjective adjective:** The instruction says, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the word \"**dramatically**\" to describe the water splash, which is a subjective interpretation of the action's visual impact.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is very good in terms of its accuracy and descriptive detail. However, it fails to fully adhere to the instructions by using the forbidden word \"frame\" and the subjective adjective \"dramatically.\" To be perfect, it would need to rephrase those specific parts.",
