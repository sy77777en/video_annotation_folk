    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic seascape scenery shot capturing a powerful ocean scene. Turbulent, turquoise waves with white foamy crests crash violently against large, dark, rugged sea stacks and a towering cliff face under a clear, light-blue sky. A flock of birds flies in a loose formation across the upper portion of the frame, adding a sense of life to the vast landscape. The video does not have a single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and raw, untamed atmosphere of the coastal environment. The composition emphasizes the powerful interplay between the sea and the land rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and explains the lack of a primary subject, it relies heavily on subjective and emotional language such as \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" \"violently,\" \"raw,\" and \"untamed,\" which violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives. The description could be improved by replacing these with more objective visual details. For instance, instead of \"turbulent waves crash violently,\" you could describe \"large, fast-moving turquoise waves breaking into white spray against the rocks.\" The caption also includes the forbidden term \"frame\" when describing the birds' location and uses an interpretive phrase, \"adding a sense of life,\" which should be omitted. Furthermore, the description could be more specific; for example, the \"dark, rugged sea stacks\" might also be described as \"wet and glistening, with patches of green algae near the waterline,\" and the \"clear, light-blue sky\" might be more accurately depicted as having \"a few high, wispy clouds.\" Finally, the concluding explanation should be rephrased to be more objective, stating that the composition balances the visual weight of the sea, cliffs, and sky to depict the environment as a whole, rather than focusing on the \"powerful interplay\" or \"untamed atmosphere.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a seascape scene featuring large, fast-moving turquoise waves breaking into white spray against wet, glistening sea stacks with patches of green algae near the waterline and a towering cliff face. The sky is light blue with a few high, wispy clouds. A flock of birds flies in a loose formation across the upper portion of the scene. The composition balances the visual weight of the sea, cliffs, and sky to depict the environment as a whole, without focusing on a specific object.",
