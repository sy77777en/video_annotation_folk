    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic seascape scenery shot capturing a powerful ocean scene. Turbulent, turquoise waves with white foamy crests crash violently against large, dark, rugged sea stacks and a towering cliff face under a clear, light-blue sky. A flock of birds flies in a loose formation across the upper portion of the frame, adding a sense of life to the vast landscape. The video does not have a single main subject, as the focus is on conveying the immense scale and raw, untamed atmosphere of the coastal environment. The composition emphasizes the powerful interplay between the sea and the land rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\nThe caption is **not good** because while it is accurate and descriptive, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the scene as a seascape and accurately describes its components: turbulent turquoise waves, white foam, dark sea stacks, a cliff, a clear sky, and a flock of birds. The description of the elements' attributes (e.g., \"large, dark, rugged sea stacks\") is precise and plausible.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It covers all the major visual elements of the sceneâ€”the sea, the landforms, the sky, and the wildlife. It also correctly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by explaining why there is no single main subject, focusing instead on the overall environment.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has significant issues.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives\":** The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words like **\"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" \"violently,\" \"raw,\"** and **\"untamed.\"** These words interpret the mood and feeling of the scene rather than objectively describing its visual properties. The phrase **\"adding a sense of life\"** is also interpretive, describing the effect of the birds rather than their visual presence.\n*   **Violation of \"Concise\" Description:** The caption is somewhat verbose. The final two sentences, while correctly explaining the lack of a main subject as per the instructions, could be integrated more concisely into the main description.\n*   **Weak Opening:** The caption starts with \"This is a...\". A more direct and professional description would begin immediately with the scene's subjects, such as \"Turbulent, turquoise waves...\"\n\nIn summary, the caption succeeds in painting a vivid picture but fails as a technical description that adheres to the strict, objective criteria outlined in the instructions. The heavy use of subjective and interpretive language is its primary flaw.",
