The focus is on the scale and complexity of the urban landscape, highlighting the intricate network of cranes, buildings, and construction materials. The sweeping angles and vibrant colors emphasize the bustling atmosphere and the ongoing development, rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject. The emphasis is on the environment and the sense of movement and progress within the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the video as an \"urban cityscape scenery shot\" focused on a construction site. It accurately states that the emphasis is on the overall environment rather than a single subject.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The caption describes concepts and interpretations rather than just visual information. Phrases like \"ongoing development\" and \"sense of movement and progress\" are inferences about the activity, not direct descriptions of what is visible. The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The caption is complete in the sense that it follows the specific instruction for scenery shots: it identifies the shot type and explains why there is no main subject. However, it could have been more visually descriptive by briefly mentioning attributes of the key elements (e.g., \"a network of yellow cranes and partially constructed concrete and glass buildings\").\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption is filled with them:\n    *   \"**dynamic** and **expansive** view\"\n    *   \"**intricate** network\"\n    *   \"**vibrant** colors\"\n    *   \"**bustling** atmosphere\"\n    These words interpret the scene rather than objectively describing it.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Describe What is Visible\":** As mentioned under Accuracy, the caption describes abstract concepts like \"progress,\" \"development,\" and \"atmosphere\" instead of sticking to concrete visual facts.\n\n*   **Wordiness:** The instruction for scenery shots asks for a concise explanation (one to three sentences) of why there is no main subject. The caption uses four sentences to make this point (\"The focus is on the scale...\", \"The sweeping angles...\", \"The emphasis is on the environment...\"), making it repetitive and less concise than required.\n\n*   **Mentioning Camera Work:** The caption mentions \"sweeping angles,\" which refers to the cinematography. While the instructions allow mentioning motion if necessary, this phrasing focuses more on the filmmaking technique than the scene itself.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the video's category but violates core negative constraints by using subjective language, describing abstract concepts instead of visual facts, and being unnecessarily wordy. A better caption would have described the scene in more neutral, objective terms.",
