Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially good as it correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and follows some formatting rules, but it fails on the most critical instruction: providing detailed visual descriptions of the subjects.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** Assuming the video does indeed show a quiet street corner with the mentioned elements, the caption is factually accurate in its high-level summary of the scene.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption is significantly incomplete. It lists the subjects present in the scene (vending machine, bicycles, buildings, traffic light, sign) but fails to provide any of the \"key visual attributes\" for them as required by the instructions. For example, it doesn't mention the color, shape, or condition of the vending machine, the type or color of the bicycles, or the specific design of the buildings.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Identifies Scenery Shot:** It correctly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by stating, \"The video is a cityscape scenery shot,\" and explaining why there is no main subject: \"...focusing on the environment rather than a specific subject.\"\n*   **Formatting and Language:** It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple and natural English, and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** It sticks to describing what is presumably visible.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Lack of Visual Detail:** This is the biggest failure. The core instruction is to \"describe key visual attributes in detail\" for every subject mentioned. The caption lists the subjects but does not describe them. A correct caption would include details like \"a red vending machine with white lettering,\" \"two black bicycles parked against a metal railing,\" or \"a three-story residential building with beige stucco walls and brown trim.\"\n*   **Explaining Instead of Describing:** The caption spends too much time explaining the *effect* of the composition (\"emphasizing the everyday atmosphere,\" \"creating a sense of place\") instead of using that space to provide the concrete visual details that the instructions demand. While the scenery shot rule asks for an explanation of *why* there's no main subject, it does not negate the primary rule of describing the visual attributes of the elements that make up that scene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it misses the most important requirement of the instructions. While it correctly identifies the video type and follows structural rules, its failure to describe the visual attributes of the subjects makes it an unsuccessful execution of the prompt. It provides a vague summary rather than the detailed, objective description that was requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a quiet urban street corner, showcasing a cityscape scenery shot. A red vending machine with white lettering stands prominently on the sidewalk, while two black bicycles are parked against a metal railing nearby. The scene features a three-story residential building with beige stucco walls and brown trim, adding to the neighborhood's charm. A traffic light hangs above the intersection, and a no-parking sign is visible, contributing to the urban setting. The composition highlights the scale and layout of the street, offering a detailed view of the everyday atmosphere without focusing on any single object.",
