    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up view of a hand interacting with a control panel. The hand, with a light skin tone, is pressing buttons on a device that has a dark screen displaying green and white text and numbers. The panel includes various labeled buttons, such as \"PROG\" and \"RAD NAV,\" and the hand is actively engaged in pressing these buttons, suggesting interaction with the device's interface. The focus is on the hand's movement and the illuminated text on the screen, which appears to be part of a technical or navigational system.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core action of a hand interacting with a control panel, it lacks the specificity seen in the video and misrepresents some of the interactions. The hand is not just \"a hand\" but clearly a man's hand, identifiable by its size, structure, and the presence of a silver watch with a black leather strap on the wrist, which is visible as the hand moves. The caption states the hand is \"pressing buttons,\" but the primary interaction shown is the man using his thumb and index finger to rotate a large, black, textured dial in the center of the panel, which audibly clicks with each increment. He only presses the \"PROG\" button once at the beginning. The description of the panel is also incomplete; while it mentions a dark screen with green and white text, it fails to note the prominent, bright red illuminated \"FAIL\" light that flashes intermittently in the upper right corner of the unit, creating a sense of urgency. Additionally, the panel is not a standalone device but is shown to be integrated into a larger dashboard with other gauges and switches partially visible, strongly suggesting it is the cockpit of an aircraft or a complex simulator.",
