    "pre_caption": "The video features a diverse group of people standing on a bridge, viewed from below. They are leaning over a metal railing, with some gesturing or holding up their hands. The group includes individuals wearing a variety of clothing, such as jackets and hoodies, in different colors like brown, blue, and black. The people appear to be of different ages and genders, with varied hairstyles and skin tones. A sign on the bridge reads \"NO BALL GAMES.\" The overall scene conveys a sense of casual gathering or interaction among the group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the general scene of a group on a bridge viewed from below, it lacks the specific, salient details that appear in the video. The description of the people is too generic; for instance, it fails to mention the most prominent individual, a woman in a bright red jacket who is leaning furthest over the railing and laughing, or a man next to her who is holding up a phone as if recording the scene below. The caption mentions \"gesturing\" but omits the context: the group is actively waving and pointing down at a small, yellow boat passing directly underneath them, which is the clear focus of their attention and the central action of the video. Furthermore, the final sentence about a \"casual gathering\" is a subjective interpretation; a more objective description would state that the individuals are smiling and appear engaged with the event below. The mention of the \"NO BALL GAMES\" sign feels disconnected, as the video shows it is small, weathered, and located on a far pillar, making it an insignificant detail compared to the dynamic human interaction at the center of the scene.",
