    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up shot of an elderly man with light skin and short, gray hair. His face is characterized by prominent wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes. He is wearing a dark green collared shirt. Initially, his eyes are closed, but he slowly opens them, revealing light-colored eyes, and looks slightly upwards before his gaze shifts to a more direct, focused look.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the subject as an elderly man and outlines the basic sequence of his actions, it misses several key visual nuances that define the video's character and mood. The description of his hair as \"short, gray\" is correct but incomplete; the video clearly shows his hair is also thinning on top, and the texture is fine and wispy. The term \"prominent wrinkles\" is too general; the shot lingers on the deep, intricate network of crow's feet around his eyes and the pronounced lines etched into his forehead, which are highlighted by soft, directional lighting from the side. The caption mentions \"light-colored eyes\" but fails to specify their striking pale blue color, which creates a significant contrast when he opens them. Furthermore, the description of his action lacks emotional weight; he doesn't just open his eyes, he does so slowly and deliberately, as if waking from a deep thought or a short nap. The final \"direct, focused look\" is more impactful than the caption suggests, as his gaze settles directly into the camera lens, creating a powerful, intimate connection with the viewer. Finally, the \"dark green collared shirt\" is more specifically a faded, well-worn cotton button-down, with the top button undone, adding a layer of casual, lived-in history to his appearance.",
