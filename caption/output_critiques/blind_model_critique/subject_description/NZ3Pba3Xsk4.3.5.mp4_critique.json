    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of an informational sign at a zoo, positioned in front of an animal enclosure. The camera remains static, focusing on the light-colored sign which provides details about the \"Indian Rhinoceros\" (Rhinoceros unicornis) in multiple languages, complete with a habitat map and a photograph of the animal. Behind the sign, the enclosure features a dirt ground, a low concrete wall, a series of thick blue-gray posts, and a large pile of dark rocks, all surrounded by patches of green grass and trees. The video lacks a main subject as its purpose is to present the static, informational context of the zoo environment, focusing on the descriptive sign rather than any specific animal or action within the enclosure.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent and adheres very well to the complex set of instructions. It correctly identifies the nature of the video and describes the content accurately and concisely.\n\n#### Accuracy:\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main object of focus as an \"informational sign\" for the \"Indian Rhinoceros.\" It accurately describes the sign's contents (multiple languages, habitat map, photograph) and the visible elements of the enclosure behind it (dirt ground, concrete wall, blue-gray posts, rocks, grass, and trees).\n\n#### Completeness:\nThe description is very complete for a concise paragraph. It captures all the key visual elements of the static scene, giving the reader a clear understanding of both the foreground and the background. It successfully conveys that the video's purpose is informational rather than action-oriented.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the provided rules.\n\n**Strengths (What it does well):**\n\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** This is the caption's strongest point. It correctly identifies the video as a \"scenery shot\" and, as instructed, provides a clear justification: \"The video lacks a main subject as its purpose is to present the static, informational context... focusing on the descriptive sign rather than any specific animal or action.\" This is a perfect execution of that specific rule.\n*   **Concise and Coherent Paragraph:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph written in clear, natural English.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using \"image\" or \"frame\" to refer to the video itself.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives, using descriptive and objective terms like \"light-colored,\" \"thick,\" \"blue-gray,\" and \"dark.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses specific nouns like \"informational sign,\" \"concrete wall,\" and \"posts\" instead of vague terms.\n*   **Prioritization:** The description is logically ordered, starting with the sign in the foreground (the focus of the shot) before moving to the background enclosure.\n\n**Minor Areas for Improvement (Strict Interpretation of Rules):**\n\n*   **Mentioning the Camera:** The instruction states to avoid mentioning motion unless necessary. The caption includes, \"The camera remains static.\" While this is accurate, the static nature is already implied by the lack of any description of movement. The instruction's goal is to focus on *what is in the scene*, not the filmmaking technique. Removing this phrase would make the caption even more compliant.\n*   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption starts with \"This is a scenery shot of...\" which is slightly meta-descriptive. A more direct approach would be to begin describing the scene immediately (e.g., \"An informational sign at a zoo is positioned...\"). The excellent justification for it being a scenery shot is already provided at the end, making the introductory clause a bit redundant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is very good.** It is a high-quality description that follows nearly all instructions to the letter, especially the most complex ones regarding scenery shots. The minor points for improvement are based on a very strict interpretation of the rules and do not detract significantly from the overall excellence of the caption.",
