White, foamy waves crash against large, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack topped with green vegetation.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is very good but has one minor flaw regarding the use of subjective language.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a coastal landscape and precisely describes its key components: a turquoise ocean, white waves, rugged rock formations, a sea stack with green vegetation, a modern house with dark siding, and soft-focus reeds in the foreground. The details provided are specific and create a clear mental picture of the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully follows the specific instructions for a scenery shot by:\n1.  Stating the type of shot (\"coastal scenery shot\").\n2.  Describing the key environmental elements in detail.\n3.  Concluding with a clear, two-sentence explanation for why there is no main subject, correctly noting that the focus is on the atmosphere and scale of the landscape. This explanation perfectly adheres to the 1-3 sentence limit prescribed in the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to almost all instructions perfectly.\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It uses precise, specific terms for subjects (\"ocean,\" \"rock formations,\" \"sea stack,\" \"house\").\n    *   It provides excellent descriptive detail for visual attributes (e.g., \"turquoise,\" \"foamy,\" \"dark siding,\" \"feathery reeds\").\n    *   It correctly implements the special rule for scenery shots.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The caption violates the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The words \"**dramatic** view,\" \"**powerful** and **serene** atmosphere\" are subjective. They describe the feeling or mood of the scene rather than its objective visual characteristics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions, particularly the complex rule for handling scenery shots. Its only weakness is the inclusion of a few subjective adjectives. To be perfect, it should describe the scene's visual facts without interpreting its emotional impact.\n\n**Revised Example (for perfect adherence):**\n\nThis video presents a coastal scenery shot, capturing a wide view of a turquoise ocean. White, foamy waves crash against large, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack topped with green vegetation. Perched atop a cliff on the right is a small, modern house with dark siding. The entire scene is framed through soft-focus, feathery reeds in the foreground. There is no main subject because the focus is on the natural landscape, emphasizing the scale of the ocean and cliffs rather than a specific object or person.",
