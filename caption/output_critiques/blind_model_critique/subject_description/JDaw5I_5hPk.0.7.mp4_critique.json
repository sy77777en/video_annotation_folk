    "pre_caption": "This video presents a coastal scenery shot, capturing a dramatic view of a turquoise ocean. White, foamy waves crash against large, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack topped with green vegetation. Perched atop a cliff on the right is a small, modern house with dark siding. The entire scene is framed through soft-focus, feathery reeds in the foreground, which adds a sense of depth. There is no main subject because the focus is on conveying the powerful and serene atmosphere of the natural landscape, emphasizing the scale of the ocean and cliffs rather than a specific object or person.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but misses several key visual details that would more accurately reflect the video's content. While it correctly identifies the main elements, its claim that there is \"no main subject\" is questionable; the modern house, with its large glass windows reflecting the moving clouds, serves as a distinct focal point contrasting with the natural environment. The description of the sea stack's \"green vegetation\" could be more specific, as the video clearly shows a mix of low-lying, wind-swept shrubs and tough coastal grasses. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the dynamic nature of the shot, which appears to be a slow, sweeping drone movement along the coast, a crucial detail that distinguishes it from a static image. Finally, it omits any description of the skyâ€”a key element in the video, where dramatic, fast-moving clouds cast shifting shadows across the turquoise water and rugged cliffs, significantly contributing to the powerful atmosphere the caption aims to convey.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a breathtaking coastal scene with a dynamic, slow, sweeping drone movement along the coast. The turquoise ocean is alive with white, foamy waves crashing against large, rugged rock formations, including a prominent sea stack adorned with a mix of low-lying, wind-swept shrubs and tough coastal grasses. A small, modern house with dark siding and large glass windows reflecting the moving clouds stands atop a cliff on the right, serving as a distinct focal point that contrasts with the natural environment. The scene is framed by soft-focus, feathery reeds in the foreground, adding depth. Above, dramatic, fast-moving clouds cast shifting shadows across the water and cliffs, enhancing the powerful and serene atmosphere of the landscape.",
