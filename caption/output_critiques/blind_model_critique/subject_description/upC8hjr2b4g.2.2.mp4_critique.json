    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit setting, two light-gray, low-polygon figures are shown sitting at desks. The figure in the foreground is seen from behind and to the left, with its faceted hands positioned as if on a keyboard. Further back and to the right, a second figure, identifiable as a woman due to her long, faceted hair, sits in profile on a dark chair. She is also positioned at a desk, facing a glowing computer monitor. Both figures are rendered in a geometric, sculptural style, with visible flat planes making up their forms.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully captures the low-polygon aesthetic and the basic composition of the scene, but it misses key details that would likely be present in the video, making the description feel incomplete. The assertion that the middle figure is a \"man\" is speculative, as only the back is visible; a more objective description would focus on the figure's broader, more angular build without assigning a gender. The caption mentions a \"dimly lit setting\" and a \"glowing computer monitor\" but fails to connect them, likely missing the most dramatic visual element: the monitor's glow would be the primary light source, casting sharp, geometric shadows and bathing the woman and her immediate surroundings in a cool, blue or white light that contrasts with the overall darkness. The description is also very static, describing the figures as \"sitting,\" but a video would likely feature subtle movements that bring the scene to life, such as the woman's head tilting slightly, the middle figure's fingers tapping on the desk, or the light from the monitor flickering. Lastly, the description of the foreground figure's arms as \"partially visible\" is vague; it could be more specific by describing their pose, such as being crossed or resting on the edge of the desk, which would better establish the viewer's perspective as if peeking over someone's shoulder.",
