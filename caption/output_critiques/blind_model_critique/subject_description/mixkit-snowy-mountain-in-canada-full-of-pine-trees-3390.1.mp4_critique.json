    "pre_caption": "This video is a majestic aerial landscape scenery shot of a snow-covered mountain range. A prominent peak, blanketed with dense, snow-dusted evergreen trees, rises sharply in the foreground, its steep face descending towards a vast sea of white clouds that fills the valleys below. In the far distance, another range of jagged, snow-capped mountains is visible above the clouds under a pale blue sky. There is no main subject because the composition is designed to capture the immense scale and serene, powerful atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the grandeur of the wilderness itself, rather than any single object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary elements of the aerial landscape, it misses key visual details that define the scene's character. The description fails to mention the quality of light; in the video, the sun is low on the horizon, casting long, deep blue shadows across the snow and bathing the opposing peaks in a warm, golden glow that highlights the texture of the trees and rock faces. The caption also treats the scene as static, but the video includes a slow, continuous forward drift, creating a parallax effect where the foreground peak moves against the distant range, which is crucial for conveying the immense scale mentioned. Additionally, the sea of clouds is not still but undulates slowly, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil environment. Finally, the caption uses subjective words like \"majestic\" and \"serene,\" which should be replaced by describing the specific visual information—such as the sharp contrast of light and shadow and the sheer drop into the cloud-filled valley—that evokes those feelings.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video presents an aerial view of a snow-covered mountain range, capturing the dynamic interplay of light and movement. A prominent peak, adorned with dense, snow-dusted evergreen trees, rises sharply in the foreground. The sun, low on the horizon, casts long, deep blue shadows across the snow and bathes the opposing peaks in a warm, golden glow, accentuating the texture of the trees and rock faces. The scene is not static; a slow, continuous forward drift creates a parallax effect, with the foreground peak moving against the distant range, enhancing the sense of immense scale. Below, a vast sea of clouds undulates gently, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil environment. The composition focuses on the sharp contrast of light and shadow and the dramatic drop into the cloud-filled valley, conveying the grandeur of the wilderness.",
