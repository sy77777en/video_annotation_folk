    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects—a map and its highlighted points—it describes them as a static image rather than a dynamic video, which misses a key aspect of the visual experience. For instance, you could imagine the video showing the orange and blue circles animating onto the map sequentially, perhaps with a soft glow or pulse, rather than just stating they are present. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the action of the blue lines being drawn to connect the points, which is a crucial motion that defines the relationship between the locations. The description of the map as \"dark, detailed\" is a good start, but it could be more specific by describing the *type* of detail, such as \"a topographical texture with faint grid lines\" or \"a satellite view at night.\" Finally, the phrase \"emphasizing the locations' significance\" is an interpretation of intent rather than a direct visual description; a more effective caption would let the visual highlighting (the glowing circles, the animated path) speak for itself, thereby adhering more closely to the instruction to describe only what is visible.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a dynamic map with a topographical texture and faint grid lines. An orange circle animates onto the map, softly glowing as it marks \"Washington,\" followed by a blue circle that pulses to indicate the \"Flight 93 Crash Site.\" Blue lines are drawn across the map, connecting these points and illustrating a route. The visual focuses on the animated elements and their connections, highlighting the geographical relationship between the locations.",
