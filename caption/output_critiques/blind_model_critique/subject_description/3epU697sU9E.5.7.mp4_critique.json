    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It successfully adheres to the provided instructions by being accurate, complete, and well-structured.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the visual elements. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"dark, detailed map\" and precisely describes the key features: an \"orange circle\" for \"Washington,\" a \"blue circle\" for the \"Flight 93 Crash Site,\" and the \"blue lines\" connecting them. The interpretation of the lines \"suggesting a route or path\" is a logical and reasonable inference based on the visual evidence.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, covering all the salient subjects and their most important attributes. It starts with the overall context (the map) and then drills down into the specific, highlighted details (the circles and lines). It provides enough information for a reader to form a clear and accurate mental image of the video's content without being overly long.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet packed with essential information.\n*   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** It correctly identifies subject types (\"map,\" \"circle,\" \"lines\") and describes their key visual attributes (dark, detailed, orange, blue, intricate lines and textures).\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** The caption sticks to what is visually present. Phrases like \"suggesting a route\" are grounded interpretations of the visual data, not baseless speculation.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, professional, and easy to understand.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text, as requested.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective, emotional adjectives. Words like \"prominent\" and \"intricate\" are used to describe visual characteristics rather than to convey feeling. The phrase \"emphasizing the locations' significance\" is an interpretation of the visual design's intent, but it is a logical one based on the act of highlighting and is acceptable for an informative description.\n*   **Subject Differentiation and Prioritization:** It clearly distinguishes between the \"orange circle\" and the \"blue circle\" and presents the information in a logical order, starting with the main subject (the map) and moving to the key details.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality example that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the prompt. It is a model of how to write a clear, objective, and descriptive caption for visual media.",
