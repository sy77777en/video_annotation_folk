    "pre_caption": "The video features several colossal humanoid figures with exposed muscles and no skin, towering over a cityscape. The main subject is a central giant, distinguished by its massive size and prominent muscular structure, standing upright with a forward-facing posture. Surrounding this figure are other similar giants, each displaying the same muscular appearance, contributing to a sense of overwhelming scale. In the foreground, a harbor with a docked ship and industrial buildings is visible, emphasizing the contrast between the giants and the human-made structures. The scene conveys a dramatic juxtaposition of the immense figures against the smaller, detailed city elements.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is excellent. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres very closely to the detailed instructions. It successfully translates a complex and visually striking scene into a concise, objective, and informative paragraph.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is perfectly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the subjects as \"colossal humanoid figures with exposed muscles and no skin,\" which is a precise description of the titans from *Attack on Titan* shown in the video.\n*   It accurately describes their position \"towering over a cityscape\" and their key attributes like \"massive size\" and \"prominent muscular structure.\"\n*   The description of the setting as a \"harbor with a docked ship and industrial buildings\" is also spot on.\n*   The core visual theme of the video—the scale and contrast between the giants and the city—is captured accurately.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information without adding speculation.\n*   It identifies the main subject (\"a central giant\") and the secondary subjects (\"other similar giants\" and the foreground elements).\n*   It provides sufficient detail for each subject type (musculature for the giants, specific elements for the harbor) to allow a reader to form a clear mental picture.\n*   It correctly omits any mention of action or motion, as the scene is static.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption follows the instructions with remarkable precision.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both concise and packed with relevant information.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"colossal humanoid figures,\" \"ship,\" and \"industrial buildings\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It excels at describing visual attributes: \"exposed muscles,\" \"no skin,\" \"massive size,\" \"prominent muscular structure,\" \"standing upright,\" \"forward-facing posture.\"\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes the \"central giant\" from the \"other similar giants,\" adhering to the instructions.\n*   **Structure and Prioritization:** The caption correctly prioritizes the most salient subjects (the giants) before describing the contextual background (the cityscape), which is the logical order.\n*   **Avoiding Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" \"video,\" or references to specific moments in time.\n*   **Handling of Background:** The instruction states not to mention the background \"unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships.\" The caption correctly includes the cityscape because it is absolutely essential for establishing the scale and context of the giants, perfectly justifying its inclusion.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption does an excellent job of remaining objective. However, there are two phrases that border on subjective interpretation, but are used acceptably to describe visual effect:\n    *   \"...contributing to a sense of **overwhelming** scale.\"\n    *   \"The scene conveys a **dramatic** juxtaposition...\"\n    While \"overwhelming\" and \"dramatic\" can be subjective, in this context, they function as descriptive terms for the visual composition's impact (i.e., the scale is so large it appears overwhelming; the contrast is so stark it is dramatic). They do not assign emotions to the subjects themselves (e.g., \"the angry giant\") and are therefore a minor and acceptable deviation used for descriptive clarity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example of what the instructions requested. It is accurate, detailed, and structured correctly. The minor use of interpretive adjectives is justifiable as it describes the visual effect of the composition rather than an emotional state, making the description more vivid without violating the core principle of objectivity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases towering humanoid figures with exposed muscles and no skin, dominating a cityscape. The central giant, notable for its immense size and prominent muscular build, stands upright with a forward-facing stance. Surrounding it are other similar giants, each contributing to the overwhelming scale of the scene. In the foreground, a harbor with a docked ship and industrial buildings highlights the stark contrast between the giants and the human-made structures, creating a dramatic visual juxtaposition.",
