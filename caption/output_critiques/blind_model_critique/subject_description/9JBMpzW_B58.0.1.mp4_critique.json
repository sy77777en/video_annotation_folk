    "pre_caption": "This is a seascape scenery shot captured from the bow of a large container ship navigating the open ocean at night. The sky above is a breathtaking celestial display, filled with a dense field of brilliant stars and the luminous band of the Milky Way, partially veiled by dark, drifting clouds. A faint, ethereal green and yellow glow, possibly airglow, lines the horizon where the dark sea meets the star-filled expanse. There is no main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale and serene atmosphere of the natural environment. The ship serves merely as a vantage point, its presence grounding the viewer and highlighting the vastness of the sea and sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the scene as a seascape at night and follows the instruction to explain the absence of a main subject. However, it relies heavily on subjective and interpretive language, such as \"breathtaking,\" \"luminous,\" and \"serene atmosphere,\" which the guidelines explicitly prohibit. The phrase \"possibly airglow\" also introduces speculation, which should be avoided; it is better to describe only what is visually certain, such as \"a faint green and yellow glow along the horizon.\" The description is also missing key visual information that would be present in such a video. For instance, it fails to describe the foreground, where the dark, silhouetted bow of the container ship, perhaps with visible railings and deck equipment, would frame the entire view. Furthermore, it omits the dynamic element of the ship's constant forward motion through the water and the corresponding faint reflections of the stars and Milky Way on the dark, moving surface of the ocean. The final two sentences are overly analytical, explaining the composition's intent (\"grounding the viewer\") rather than simply describing the visual content in an objective manner. A better caption would incorporate the tangible details of the ship in the foreground and the reflections on the water while replacing subjective praise with objective descriptions of the sky's density of stars and the specific colors on the horizon.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a nighttime seascape from the bow of a large container ship navigating the open ocean. The sky is densely filled with stars and the band of the Milky Way, partially obscured by drifting clouds. A faint green and yellow glow lines the horizon where the sea meets the sky. In the foreground, the dark silhouette of the ship's bow, with visible railings and deck equipment, frames the view. The ship's forward motion creates faint reflections of the stars and Milky Way on the moving surface of the ocean, emphasizing the vastness of the sea and sky.",
