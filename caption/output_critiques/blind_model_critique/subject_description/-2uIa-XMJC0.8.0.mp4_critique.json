    "pre_caption": "The video features a person in a room filled with screens. Initially, the scene is devoid of any subjects, but the person soon walks toward the camera. As they approach, the shot transitions to a full view of the person, who is wearing dark clothing. The person then punches the camera, shifting the shot to a middle view. After the action, the shot returns to a full view, with the person still visible among the screens. The focus is on the person's movement and interaction with the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video takes place in a room filled with screens. A person walks toward the camera and then punches it. The shot size transitions from no subject at the beginning to a full shot when the person appears, then to a middle shot as he punch the camera, and finally back to a full shot.**",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good. While it correctly identifies the main subject and the sequence of actions, it fails to adhere to several key instructions, resulting in a description that is inaccurate and critically incomplete.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The caption's claim that the scene is \"initially... devoid of any subjects\" is inaccurate. The \"room filled with screens\" constitutes the initial subject matter of the shot, and these screens should be described as such.\n*   The description of the action is generally correct (a person appears, approaches, and interacts with the camera, causing shot changes).\n\n### Completeness\n*   **This is the most significant failure.** The caption is extremely incomplete. The instructions demand a detailed description of the subject's key visual attributes. The caption only mentions the person is \"wearing dark clothing.\" It completely omits crucial details like gender, approximate age, skin tone, hairstyle, hair color, and the specific style of clothing, all of which are essential for a comprehensive description.\n*   It mentions \"a room filled with screens\" but provides no description of the screens themselves (e.g., what they are displaying, their size, their arrangement).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several explicit rules:\n\n*   **Lack of Detail:** It directly violates the instruction to \"describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language.\" The description of the person is minimal and uninformative.\n*   **Vague Subject Type:** It uses the general term \"person\" instead of a more precise term like \"man\" or \"woman,\" which the instructions encourage if the gender is discernible.\n*   **Inclusion of Meta-Commentary:** The final sentence, \"The focus is on the person's movement and interaction with the camera,\" is an analysis of the video's directorial intent. The instructions require a purely objective description of what is visible, not an interpretation of the video's focus.\n*   **Missing Transition Details:** While it correctly notes that the shot transitions, it fails to describe the *type* of transition (e.g., hard cut, glitch effect) as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a weak, high-level summary of the action but fails its primary purpose: to provide a concise yet **informative description of the subjects** with detailed visual attributes. It ignores the core requirements for detail and objectivity laid out in the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens in a dimly lit room filled with multiple screens displaying static and flickering images, creating an eerie atmosphere. A young man, appearing to be in his late 20s, with light brown skin, short black hair, and wearing a fitted black leather jacket and dark jeans, is already present in the scene. He begins to walk toward the camera, and as he approaches, the shot transitions with a glitch effect to a full view of him. The man then punches the camera, causing the shot to shift to a middle view. After this action, the shot returns to a full view, with the man still visible among the screens, which are arranged in a semi-circle around him. The focus remains on his movement and interaction with the camera, without any directorial commentary.",
