    "pre_caption": "This is a somber coastal scenery shot depicting the upper portion of a dilapidated lighthouse against a stormy sky. The tower, made of a pale, weathered material, shows signs of disrepair with boarded-up windows and crumbling sections. It is topped by a dark, caged lantern room. The focus of the scene is on the oppressive atmosphere rather than the structure itself, with heavy rain slanting across the frame and a turbulent, murky green sky creating a bleak and desolate mood. The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies a \"dilapidated lighthouse\" with a \"pale, weathered material,\" \"boarded-up windows,\" \"crumbling sections,\" and a \"dark, caged lantern room.\" It also accurately describes the \"stormy sky,\" \"heavy rain,\" and \"murky green sky.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete, capturing the main subject and its surrounding environment effectively. It provides a full picture of the scene depicted.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in several critical ways:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives\":** This is the most significant failure. The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption is filled with subjective and interpretive language, such as \"somber,\" \"oppressive atmosphere,\" \"bleak and desolate mood,\" and \"sense of isolation and decay.\" These words describe feelings and interpretations, not objective visual facts.\n*   **Violation of \"Don't Mention the Frame\":** The instructions state, \"...without referring to any specific one (e.g., donâ€™t mention things like 'first frame' or 'last frame'), and avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption violates this by using the phrase \"slanting across the frame.\"\n*   **Misapplication of the \"Scenery Shot\" Rule:** The instructions specify that for scenery shots *without* salient subjects, one should explain that the focus is on the environment. This video, however, has a very clear and salient subject: the lighthouse. The caption incorrectly applies this rule by stating, \"The focus of the scene is on the oppressive atmosphere rather than the structure itself.\" It should have simply described the lighthouse as the main subject within its stormy environment.\n*   **Inclusion of Analysis:** The final sentence, \"The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment,\" is an artistic analysis of the scene's composition and effect. The instructions require a purely descriptive caption, not an interpretation of the creator's intent or the scene's meaning.",
