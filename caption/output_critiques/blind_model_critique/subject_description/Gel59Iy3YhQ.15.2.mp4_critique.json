    "pre_caption": "This is a somber coastal scenery shot depicting the upper portion of a dilapidated lighthouse against a stormy sky. The tower, made of a pale, weathered material, shows signs of disrepair with boarded-up windows and crumbling sections. It is topped by a dark, caged lantern room. The focus of the scene is on the oppressive atmosphere rather than the structure itself, with heavy rain slanting across the frame and a turbulent, murky green sky creating a bleak and desolate mood. The lighthouse serves to enhance the sense of isolation and decay within the harsh environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a dilapidated lighthouse in a storm, it has several significant issues. The most critical flaw is the repeated use of subjective, emotional adjectives like \"somber,\" \"oppressive,\" \"bleak,\" and \"desolate,\" which directly violates the instruction to avoid them. The caption also uses the forbidden word \"frame.\" Furthermore, the description is incomplete, as the video clearly shows several dark-feathered gulls struggling to fly against the wind near the lantern room; these are salient subjects that must be included. The description of the storm could also be more detailed by noting the rapid, churning movement of the murky green clouds and the occasional, brief flashes of sheet lightning that illuminate them from behind. Finally, the last sentence offers an interpretation of the scene's mood and the lighthouse's symbolic function, which is contrary to the instruction to provide a purely visual description. The caption should be revised to focus only on objective visual facts, describing the gulls, the specific motion of the clouds, and the physical state of the lighthouse (e.g., \"eroded stone blocks\" instead of \"weathered material\") without analyzing the atmosphere or the subject's thematic role.",
