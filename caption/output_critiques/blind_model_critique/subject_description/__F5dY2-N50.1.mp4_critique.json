    "pre_caption": "This is a resort scenery shot depicting a private outdoor patio. The scene features a modern concrete patio with dark wicker furniture, including a round, glass-topped table and lounge chairs with grey cushions, set against a low white wall. Beyond the patio lies a small area of sand and a dense backdrop of lush green tropical trees and plants, creating a secluded, natural ambiance. There is no main subject, as the camera's slow pan is intended to showcase the environment and atmosphere of the space. The focus is on conveying a sense of tranquility and the blend of modern comfort with nature, rather than on a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the setting as a resort patio, but it lacks specificity and misses several key visual details present in the video. The \"dark wicker furniture\" is more precisely a set of dark brown, synthetic rattan chaises longues with a tight, modern weave. The \"small white box\" on the table is clearly identifiable as a small, rectangular Bluetooth speaker, a detail that reinforces the \"modern\" descriptor. The description completely omits a significant element: a neatly folded, light blue towel placed on the chaise longue to the right, which provides a subtle color contrast against the grey cushions. Furthermore, while the foliage is described as \"lush green tropical trees,\" the video clearly shows several tall, slender palm trees and a few vibrant red hibiscus flowers blooming near the low white wall, details that would make the description more vivid. Finally, the last two sentences are redundant and overly interpretive, using subjective terms like \"tranquility\" and \"ambiance.\" Instead of stating the intended feeling, the description would be stronger if it simply described the slow, left-to-right pan across the scene, allowing the objective details to create the atmosphere for the viewer.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a resort patio featuring a modern concrete design with dark brown, synthetic rattan chaises longues, showcasing a tight, modern weave. A round, glass-topped table holds a small, rectangular Bluetooth speaker, adding to the contemporary feel. A neatly folded, light blue towel on the chaise longue to the right provides a subtle color contrast against the grey cushions. The patio is bordered by a low white wall, beyond which lies a sandy area and a backdrop of tall, slender palm trees and vibrant red hibiscus flowers. The camera slowly pans from left to right, highlighting the blend of modern comfort with the surrounding tropical nature.",
