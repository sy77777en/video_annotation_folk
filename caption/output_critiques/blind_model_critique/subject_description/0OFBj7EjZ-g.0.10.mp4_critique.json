    "pre_caption": "The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera. The subject on the right, occupying the full frame height, appears to be a woman standing upright with her hands on her hips. The central subject, approximately 40% of the frame height, seems to be a child wearing a hooded outfit. Both figures are positioned facing away from the viewer, observing a group of colorful fish swimming in front of them. The fish vary in size and color, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The setting suggests an aquarium environment, with the subjects remaining stationary as they watch the aquatic life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows two human-shaped subjects with their backs to the camera, revealing their bodies above the calf. The subject on the right occupies full frame height, while the one in the center occupies 40% of the frame height. In front of them, a group of fish swims past, suggesting a setting resembling an aquarium.**",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is **not good** because while it is generally clear and descriptive, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate in its description of a plausible scene. It correctly identifies two human subjects and a group of fish, describes their orientation (backs to the camera), their actions (watching, swimming), and the likely setting (an aquarium). The use of cautious language like \"appears to be\" and \"seems to be\" is appropriate for details that may not be certain from the video's perspective.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is reasonably complete, covering the primary and secondary subjects and their relationship. It establishes a clear picture of the scene. However, it could potentially be more complete by including specific visual details like the color of the subjects' clothing or hair, if visible.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has significant flaws.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"woman,\" \"child,\" \"fish\") and handles ambiguity well (\"human-shaped subjects\").\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes the two people by their location (\"on the right,\" \"central\") and relative size.\n*   **Objectivity:** For the most part, it avoids subjective language.\n*   **Contextual Background:** It correctly includes the \"aquarium environment\" as necessary context for the relationship between the subjects.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n1.  **Forbidden Terminology:** The most significant error is the direct violation of the rule: \"**avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'**.\" The caption uses the word \"frame\" twice (\"occupying the full frame height,\" \"40% of the frame height\"). This is a critical failure to follow instructions.\n2.  **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...,\" which acts as introductory text. The instruction states to return \"**only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text**.\" The description should start directly, for example: \"Two human-shaped subjects stand with their backs to the camera...\"\n3.  **Subjective Adjectives:** The phrase \"adding **dynamic** movement to the scene\" uses a subjective adjective. \"Dynamic\" is an interpretation of the quality of the movement. The instruction is to \"**avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions**\" and to focus on objective description. Simply stating that the fish are swimming would be more compliant.\n\nIn conclusion, while the caption successfully captures the essence of the scene, its failure to follow explicit negative constraints—particularly the prohibition of the word \"frame\"—makes it a poor execution of the given instructions.",
