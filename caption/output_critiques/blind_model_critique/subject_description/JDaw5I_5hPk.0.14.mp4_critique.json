    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot of a vast and misty coastline. The scene is characterized by a muted, blue-gray color palette and a thick haze that softens the details, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Gentle waves with white crests wash over a wide, sandy beach, while in the distance, the dark, jagged silhouettes of large sea stacks and cliffs rise from the water and shore. The focus is on the immense scale and serene mood of the environment, with a couple of tiny, distant figures on the beach serving only to accentuate the vastness of the natural setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good, but it has a few minor flaws that prevent it from perfectly adhering to all instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes a landscape that matches the description: a misty coastline with a muted color palette, waves on a sandy beach, and large sea stacks in the distance. The detail about \"tiny, distant figures\" serving to accentuate the scale is a sharp and accurate observation.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures the overall scene, its key components (waves, beach, sea stacks, cliffs), the prevailing color and atmosphere (haze, muted colors), and the presence of minor subjects (the figures). It provides a comprehensive overview of the visual information.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption follows most of the instructions well, but it violates two specific negative constraints.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and explains that the focus is on the environment, scale, and mood rather than a specific subject, perfectly following the dedicated instruction for such scenes.\n*   **Concise & Holistic Description:** It provides a single, coherent paragraph that describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It uses specific and descriptive language for the visual attributes, such as \"muted, blue-gray color palette,\" \"gentle waves with white crests,\" and \"dark, jagged silhouettes.\"\n*   **Subject Prioritization:** It correctly prioritizes the overall landscape before mentioning the minor figures, treating them as secondary elements that provide scale.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere:**\n\n*   **Use of Forbidden Words:** The instruction states, \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'\" and the caption should be a \"description... without introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"**This video presents**...\", directly violating the rule to avoid the word \"video\" and adding introductory phrasing.\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses the phrases \"**ethereal atmosphere**\" and \"**serene mood**,\" which are subjective interpretations of the scene's feeling rather than objective visual descriptions.",

Gentle waves with white crests wash over a wide, sandy beach, while in the distance, the dark, jagged silhouettes of large sea stacks and cliffs rise from the water and shore. The immense scale of the environment is highlighted by a couple of tiny, distant figures on the beach, accentuating the vastness of the natural setting.",
