    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that very effectively follows the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete for a concise summary, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It uses precise terminology for the subjects (\"coral reef ecosystem,\" \"brain corals,\" \"soft corals,\" \"fish\") and provides specific, verifiable visual attributes (branching brown structures, rounded green corals, yellow and orange fish). It accurately portrays a typical, lively coral reef scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete within the scope of the \"concise yet informative\" instruction. It successfully identifies the primary subjects (coral, fish) and the overall setting (underwater reef). It provides enough detail to create a clear mental picture of the scene without getting bogged down in describing every single organism, which would violate the conciseness rule. It correctly prioritizes the larger, static elements (coral) before describing the smaller, more dynamic ones (fish).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the subjects (coral and fish) and their visual attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It mentions the \"clear blue water,\" but this is essential context for an underwater scene and is a justified use of background information.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption mostly uses objective language. Words like \"vibrant\" and \"teeming\" are slightly interpretive, but in this context, they function as efficient descriptors for a scene with bright colors and many moving subjects, making this a very minor and acceptable deviation.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses specific terms (\"brain corals,\" \"soft corals\") instead of vague ones.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing key visual attributes like color (\"brown,\" \"green,\" \"white,\" \"yellow,\" \"orange\"), shape (\"branching,\" \"rounded\"), and quantity (\"numerous\").\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the different types of coral by their unique appearances.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, clean paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, as requested.\n\n**Overall, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, descriptive, and technically sound.**",
