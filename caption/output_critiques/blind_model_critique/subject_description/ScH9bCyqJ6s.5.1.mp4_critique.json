    "pre_caption": "A person with light-colored skin holds a blue smartphone circuit board with both hands, a gold-colored ring visible on their left ring finger. The circuit board features a prominent camera module with three lenses set in silver-colored metal housings. A large, silver-colored metal shield covers a central portion of the board, surrounded by various small electronic components, connectors, and thin black wires. The person uses a silver-colored precision screwdriver with a knurled handle to point at and touch the smallest of the three camera lenses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and serves as a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all the rules.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subjects as a \"person,\" a \"smartphone circuit board,\" and a \"precision screwdriver.\" The specific details, such as the board's blue color, the three-lens camera module, the silver-colored metal shield, the gold ring on the person's finger, and the knurled handle of the screwdriver, are all precise and correct. The action of using the screwdriver to point at the smallest lens is also described accurately.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information without being overly verbose. It describes the key subjects, their most important attributes, and their relationship to one another (the person holding the board and using the tool on it). It successfully paints a full picture of the video's content.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It is both concise and highly informative.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their visual attributes, correctly omitting any description of the background.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective adjectives and emotional language, using purely descriptive terms like \"light-colored skin,\" \"prominent camera module,\" and \"knurled handle.\"\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise terms (\"smartphone circuit board,\" \"precision screwdriver,\" \"camera module\") instead of vague ones. It correctly uses \"person\" since other identifying details like gender are not visible.\n    *   **Attribute Detail:** It provides excellent detail for each subject as instructed (e.g., the person's skin tone and ring; the board's color, components, and layout; the screwdriver's color, type, and texture).\n    *   **Structure and Flow:** The description is logically structured, starting with the person, moving to the primary object they are holding, and finishing with the specific action being performed. This prioritization is effective.\n    *   **Forbidden Words:** The caption correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is exceptionally good. It demonstrates a perfect understanding and application of all the provided guidelines, resulting in a description that is accurate, detailed, objective, and easy to understand. There are no areas that require improvement.",
