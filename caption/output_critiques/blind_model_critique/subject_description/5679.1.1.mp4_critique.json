    "pre_caption": "A man with brown skin, long dark dreadlocks, a beard, and a mustache stands in a kitchen, facing forward and speaking. He wears a black sweater with a white graphic of a camel and text on the front, and he is chopping a carrot with a knife on a wooden cutting board. In the background to the right, a woman with brown skin and dark hair pulled back sits on a counter. She is wearing a purple long-sleeved shirt under a pink and red dress and is looking down at a smartphone in her hands. The kitchen island and counter are covered with a large assortment of fresh produce, including multiple pineapples, bunches of bananas, apples, lemons, limes, oranges, and a head of purple cauliflower.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption describes the scene as if it were a static photograph rather than a dynamic video. For instance, it states the man is both \"facing forward and speaking\" and \"chopping a carrot,\" actions he would likely perform sequentially, alternating his gaze between the camera and the cutting board. The description of the woman as solely \"looking down at a smartphone\" might be inaccurate for the video's full duration; she likely looks up, smiles, or interacts with the man, which would be a crucial detail to include. The caption also misses an opportunity for greater specificity; the \"white text\" on the sweater could be described if legible, and the \"pink and red apron\" could have a specific pattern, like stripes or florals. Furthermore, the description lacks any mention of camera work. A video of this nature would probably include cuts, such as a close-up on the man's hands chopping the carrot or a brief shot focusing on the woman's reaction, but the caption treats the entire scene as one continuous wide shot. Finally, the man's expression while speaking is omitted; noting if he is smiling, serious, or enthusiastic would provide important context about the video's tone.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man with brown skin, long dark dreadlocks, a beard, and a mustache stands in a kitchen, alternating his gaze between the camera and a wooden cutting board as he speaks and chops a carrot. He wears a black sweater featuring a white graphic of a camel and text that reads \"Desert Vibes.\" His expression is enthusiastic as he engages with the audience. The video includes close-up shots of his hands skillfully chopping the carrot. In the background, a woman with brown skin and dark hair pulled back sits on a counter, wearing a purple long-sleeved shirt under a pink and red floral dress. She occasionally looks up from her smartphone, smiling and interacting with the man. The kitchen island and counter are filled with a vibrant assortment of fresh produce, including pineapples, bananas, apples, lemons, limes, oranges, and a head of purple cauliflower. The video features dynamic camera work, capturing both the man's actions and the woman's reactions, adding a lively and engaging tone to the scene.",
