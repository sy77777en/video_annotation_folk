    "pre_caption": "The video features a wooden sailing ship navigating through rough, turbulent ocean waters. The ship is characterized by its large, dark sails and detailed wooden structure, including a prominent deck and railings. The vessel appears sturdy, with visible cabins and masts. The ocean is depicted with high, crashing waves, emphasizing the ship's struggle against the elements. The ship's orientation changes from being prominently visible to partially submerged, suggesting a challenging journey through the stormy sea.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the main subject and the essence of the video but fails to adhere strictly to all the negative constraints, particularly regarding objectivity.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately identifies the primary subject as a \"wooden sailing ship\" and the environment as \"rough, turbulent ocean waters.\" The described attributes like \"large, dark sails,\" \"wooden structure,\" \"deck,\" \"railings,\" \"cabins,\" and \"masts\" are precise and plausible for such a scene.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the subject's material, key parts, and its dynamic interaction with the environment (navigating, being partially submerged by waves). It effectively paints a full picture of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and succinct summary of the video's content.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses a precise term, \"wooden sailing ship,\" instead of a vague one.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It details key visual attributes of the ship (wooden, dark sails, deck, railings).\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific \"frames\" or \"images.\"\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the most salient subject (the ship) and its relationship with its immediate environment (the ocean).\n\n**Weaknesses (Where the caption fails to follow instructions):**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:** The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption violates this rule in several places:\n    *   \"...emphasizing the ship's **struggle** against the elements.\" The word \"struggle\" is an interpretation of the event that assigns emotion and intent. A more objective description would focus only on the physical action, such as \"the ship is repeatedly hit by high, crashing waves.\"\n    *   \"...suggesting a **challenging journey**...\" The phrase \"challenging journey\" is an inference about the nature of the event, not a direct visual description. The visual fact is the ship moving through a stormy sea.\n    *   \"The vessel appears **sturdy**...\" While based on visual evidence, \"sturdy\" is a judgment of the ship's quality rather than a purely descriptive attribute.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is strong in its structure, clarity, and descriptive detail. However, its primary flaw is the inclusion of interpretive and emotional language (\"struggle,\" \"challenging\"), which directly contradicts the instruction to remain objective and stick to only what is visually present. To be fully compliant, the caption should be revised to remove these subjective interpretations.\n\n**A more compliant version would be:**\n\n\"A wooden sailing ship with large, dark sails navigates through turbulent ocean waters. The ship features a detailed wooden structure with a visible deck, railings, cabins, and masts. The ocean has high, crashing waves that periodically obscure the vessel. The ship's orientation changes as it moves, at times being fully visible and at other times partially submerged by the water.\"",
