    "pre_caption": "From a rear-facing perspective on a motorcycle, a racer is seen in a crouched position. This person is wearing a blue, white, and black leather racing suit with the word \"MEGLIO\" in white lettering with a red outline across the lower back. A portion of the motorcycle's white tail section, featuring a black stylized \"W\" logo, is visible on the left. Alongside and slightly ahead, another racer on a red and white motorcycle is wearing a red, orange, and black suit. Further in the distance, a third racer in a red and white suit rides a similar red and white motorcycle. To the right, the front wheel and part of the front fairing of a black motorcycle are also visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A camera is mounted on the rear of a motorcycle, capturing part of the motorcycle and its rider. At the same time, the camera also records other motorcycles and the people riding them.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the subjects and their gear, but it could better capture the dynamic nature of the race. The description of the second racer exiting the frame is a bit clinical; in the video, the camera bike seems to be actively overtaking them at high speed, so describing it as \"the second racer is quickly passed and moves out of view\" would better reflect the action. The phrase \"At the very beginning\" violates the instruction to avoid temporal frame references; this detail about the red and white motorcycle's front wheel could be integrated more smoothly by stating that the camera is positioned within a tight pack of racers. Furthermore, while the racers are the main subjects, the video likely shows them leaning into a turn on the track. Mentioning this pose and the context of the racetrack itself is necessary to fully describe their action and relationship to their environment, as their crouched and angled positions are a direct result of navigating the course. The description of the \"MEGLIO\" text and \"io\" logo is very specific, but a more general description of the suit's color-blocked pattern might be more visually descriptive and less like a transcription.",
