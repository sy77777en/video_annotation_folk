    "pre_caption": "A man, appearing to be in his late 50s or early 60s, with short, neatly combed gray hair, fair skin, and a furrowed brow creating a stern facial expression, is the central figure, standing and facing directly forward. He wears a dark blue military service dress uniform jacket, distinguished by a large array of colorful ribbon bars and a silver pilot wings insignia on the left breast, metallic star insignia on the shoulder straps, various emblems on the lapels, and a name tag on the right breast. A light blue shirt and a dark necktie are visible at the collar. In the dimly lit background, three other figures in formal attire are present but indistinct: one man to his left, another to his right, and a third individual positioned further behind him.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It meticulously follows the instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and highly professional.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is extremely accurate in its descriptive language.\n*   **Verifiable Details:** It describes specific, verifiable elements like \"dark blue military service dress uniform jacket,\" \"ribbon bars,\" \"silver pilot wings insignia,\" and \"metallic star insignia.\" This level of detail suggests a precise and factual observation.\n*   **Cautious Language:** It uses phrases like \"appearing to be in his late 50s or early 60s\" for age and describes the background figures as \"indistinct,\" which correctly adheres to the rule of not describing what is uncertain or not clearly visible.\n*   **Objective Observation:** The description of the facial expression is tied to a physical attribute (\"a furrowed brow creating a stern facial expression\"), grounding the observation in what is visually present rather than making a purely emotional judgment.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive and provides a full picture of the salient subjects.\n*   **Main Subject Focus:** It correctly identifies the man in uniform as the \"central figure\" and dedicates the majority of the description to his detailed visual attributes, as instructed. It covers his age, hair, skin tone, expression, pose, orientation, and a thorough breakdown of his clothing and insignia.\n*   **Secondary Subjects:** It acknowledges the presence of the other figures but correctly keeps their descriptions brief and general (\"three other figures in formal attire are present but indistinct\"), which is appropriate given their lack of clarity and secondary role in the scene.\n*   **Hierarchy of Information:** The description is perfectly structured, starting with the most prominent subject and his general features before moving to the specifics of his uniform, and finally mentioning the less important background figures.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption flawlessly adheres to every rule in the provided instructions.\n*   **Format and Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The language is direct and packed with information without being verbose.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"man,\" \"individual\") and distinguishes the background figures by their location (\"to his left,\" \"to his right,\" \"further behind\").\n*   **Attribute Detail:** The level of detail for the main subject's clothing, pose (\"standing\"), and orientation (\"facing directly forward\") is exemplary.\n*   **Handling of Ambiguity:** The use of \"stern\" is a perfect example of how to follow the spirit of the law. While \"stern\" can be a subjective emotion, the caption justifies it by linking it to the physical \"furrowed brow,\" effectively describing the *appearance* of the expression, not guessing the man's internal emotional state.\n*   **Background Mention:** It mentions the \"dimly lit background\" only to contextualize the indistinct figures, which is a necessary and permitted use of background information according to the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is detailed, objective, and well-structured, demonstrating a complete understanding of all the requirements.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man, seemingly in his late 50s or early 60s, with short, neatly combed gray hair, fair skin, and a furrowed brow that gives him a stern expression, stands as the central figure, facing directly forward.
