    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a black suit with a white dress shirt, who is the main subject. He appears to be in his 30s, with short dark hair, and is shown in an action-oriented pose, breaking through a large glass window. His expression is focused and determined. The video captures him with arms raised, emphasizing the dynamic movement as he moves through the shattered glass. In the background, there are two other men; one is partially visible, wearing a light-colored jacket, and appears to be turning away from the action, while the other is bent over a table, possibly reacting to the commotion. The scene conveys a sense of urgency and dramatic action centered around the main subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several areas where it fails to adhere strictly to the instructions. While it successfully captures the main subject and action, it includes subjective interpretations and speculation that should be avoided.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is largely accurate in its description of the visual facts. It correctly identifies a main subject (a man in a suit), his action (breaking through a glass window), and the presence of two other men in the background with their respective postures.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete. It focuses on the most salient subject in detail, as instructed, and briefly describes the secondary subjects. It successfully synthesizes the action from the video into a coherent description rather than a frame-by-frame account.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has notable flaws.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Core Task:** It provides a description of the subjects, their types (\"man\"), and key visual attributes (\"black suit,\" \"short dark hair\").\n*   **Clarity:** It clearly distinguishes between the main subject and the two men in the background.\n*   **Prioritization:** It correctly starts with the main, most central subject before moving to the less prominent ones.\n*   **Forbidden Words:** It avoids using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** The caption uses several subjective and interpretive words.\n    *   \"...His expression is focused and **determined**.\" — \"Determined\" is an interpretation of the man's internal state rather than a neutral description of his facial features (e.g., \"set jaw,\" \"furrowed brow\").\n    *   \"...emphasizing the **dynamic** movement...\" — \"Dynamic\" is a subjective quality assessment. The description should stick to the action itself (e.g., \"with arms raised as he moves through the shattered glass\").\n    *   \"The scene conveys a **sense of urgency and dramatic action**...\" — This entire final sentence is a subjective interpretation of the mood and tone of the video, which the instructions explicitly forbid. The goal is to describe what is seen, not the feeling it evokes.\n\n*   **Violation of \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\":**\n    *   \"...the other is bent over a table, **possibly reacting to the commotion**.\" — This is speculation about the man's motivation. The instruction is to describe only what is visible, which is that he is \"bent over a table.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a good first draft but is not compliant with the rules. To be considered \"good\" according to the instructions, it must be revised to remove all subjective language and speculation.\n\nA better, compliant version would be:\n\n\"A man in his 30s with short dark hair, wearing a black suit and a white dress shirt, is breaking through a large glass window. He is captured mid-action with his arms raised as he moves through the shattered glass. In the background, a partially visible man in a light-colored jacket is turning away, and another man is bent over a table.\"",
