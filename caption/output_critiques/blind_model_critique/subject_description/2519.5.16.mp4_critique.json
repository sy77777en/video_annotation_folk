    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with light skin and short, dark hair. He has a slight beard and mustache, and his expression appears contemplative. He is wearing a collared shirt with a checkered pattern, visible beneath a dark sweater. The man is facing forward, with his eyes closed in one moment and open in another, suggesting a shift in focus or thought. His facial features are prominent, and the lighting highlights the texture of his skin.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw that violates a key instruction.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the subject's physical attributes. It correctly identifies the man's light skin, short dark hair, slight beard and mustache, and clothing (checkered collared shirt under a dark sweater). The observation that his eyes are closed at one point and open at another is also an accurate description of the action in the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete for a concise description. It successfully captures the most salient features of the subject and the primary action (the change in his eyes) without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. It provides enough information for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the man.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but fails on one critical point.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Conciseness and Format:** It is a single, clear, and coherent paragraph, written in simple English, with no introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Focus:** It focuses entirely on the subject's type and visual attributes, avoiding mention of the background.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It successfully combines details from different moments in the video (\"eyes closed in one moment and open in another\") without referring to specific \"frames.\"\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses the precise term \"man\" and avoids vague words.\n*   **Attribute Detail:** It provides specific details about clothing, hair, and facial hair.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The primary violation is the use of the word **\"contemplative.\"** The instructions explicitly state, **\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"** \"Contemplative\" describes a perceived internal state or emotion, which is a subjective interpretation rather than an objective visual description. A better, more compliant description would focus on the physical state of his facial features, such as \"his expression is neutral with his mouth closed.\"\n*   **Interpretation vs. Description:** The phrase \"suggesting a shift in focus or thought\" is an interpretation of the action. While it's a logical inference, the instructions favor pure description. A more neutral phrasing would be to simply state the action, as the caption already does (\"with his eyes closed in one moment and open in another\"), and omit the speculative part.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe caption is well-written and follows most of the complex rules. However, its use of the subjective term \"contemplative\" is a clear and significant violation of the instructions. To be fully compliant, the caption should be revised to describe the man's expression using only objective, observable details.",
