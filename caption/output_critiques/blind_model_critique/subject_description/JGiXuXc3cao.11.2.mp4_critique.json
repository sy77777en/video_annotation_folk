    "pre_caption": "Two men in matching yellow, long-sleeved collared shirts are depicted sitting side-by-side. The man on the left, who has blondish-green hair in a bowl cut, leans forward with his head bowed. He presses his right hand to his forehead, covering his eyes, while his left hand holds a purple object resembling a pen or straw. To his right sits another man with dark, neatly combed hair and glasses. This man holds a white mug in his left hand and covers his mouth and nose with his right hand as he looks down.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly follows the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies two men and precisely describes their matching yellow shirts, their distinct hairstyles (\"blondish-green hair in a bowl cut,\" \"dark, neatly combed hair\"), and their specific poses (one leaning forward with a hand on his forehead, the other covering his mouth and looking down). The descriptions of the objects they hold—a \"purple object resembling a pen or straw\" and a \"white mug\"—are also accurate and appropriately handle ambiguity.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures all the salient visual information about the subjects without getting bogged down in unnecessary background details. It provides sufficient detail on clothing, hair, accessories (glasses), held objects, and posture for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres flawlessly to all instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the two men, their attributes, and their actions.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional words, describing only what is visually present (e.g., \"covers his mouth\" instead of \"is shocked\").\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise terms (\"men,\" \"mug\") and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Clear Differentiation:** It effectively distinguishes between the two subjects by their location (\"man on the left,\" \"To his right\").\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details about clothing, hair, and pose as required.",
