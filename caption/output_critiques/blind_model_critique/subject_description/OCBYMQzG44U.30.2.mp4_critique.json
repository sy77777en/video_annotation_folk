    "pre_caption": "This video presents a surreal indoor scenery shot, capturing a disorienting journey through a liminal space. The sequence begins in a sterile, green-lit room with white tiled walls, looking down the mouth of a vibrant red water slide. The perspective then plunges into the dark, enclosed tube of the slide, a tight, reddish-brown tunnel that opens toward a bright light. The camera emerges at water level into a long, narrow, flooded hallway, also lined with white tiles and small, high windows. The murky green water is populated by several colorful, abandoned-looking pool floats, including a yellow ring, a purple tube, and an orange inflatable animal. The video lacks a main subject, instead using the first-person perspective to immerse the viewer in the strange and unsettling atmosphere of the environment itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions, most notably the rule against using subjective and emotional language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Accurate:** The caption accurately describes the visual content and the sequence of events in the video. It correctly identifies the green-lit room, the red water slide, the dark tunnel, the flooded tiled hallway, and the various pool floats (yellow ring, purple tube, orange inflatable).\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Mostly Complete:** The description covers the entire journey from start to finish, detailing the different environments and the objects within them. It correctly identifies that the video is a scenery shot without a main subject.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in the following critical ways:\n\n*   **Violation - Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words like \"**surreal**,\" \"**disorienting**,\" \"**sterile**,\" \"**strange**,\" and \"**unsettling**.\" It also uses the interpretive phrase \"**abandoned-looking**.\" These words describe a feeling or an interpretation rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Violation - Use of Introductory Text:** The instructions require returning \"**only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.**\" The caption begins with \"This video presents...,\" which is a form of introductory text. The description should start directly with the visual information.\n*   **Partial Violation - Use of Simple English:** The instruction asks for \"**simple, natural English.**\" The use of terms like \"**liminal space**\" is interpretive and not simple, objective language.\n*   **Good Adherence - Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption correctly follows the instructions for a scenery shot by explaining why there is no main subject: \"The video lacks a main subject, instead using the first-person perspective to immerse the viewer in the... environment itself.\"\n*   **Good Adherence - Structure and Detail:** The caption successfully combines details from across the video into a single coherent paragraph, avoids the words \"image\" or \"frame,\" and describes the transitions and key objects with good visual detail (e.g., \"vibrant red water slide,\" \"white tiled walls,\" \"yellow ring\").\n\nIn summary, while the caption is factually accurate and descriptive, its heavy reliance on subjective, emotional, and interpretive language is a direct and significant violation of the core instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows an indoor scene starting in a green-lit room with white tiled walls, featuring a red water slide.
