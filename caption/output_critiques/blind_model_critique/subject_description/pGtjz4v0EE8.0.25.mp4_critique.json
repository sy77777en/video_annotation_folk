    "pre_caption": "This is an interior scenery shot capturing the opulent and reverent atmosphere of a grand European church or cathedral. The camera slowly pans across the vast space, revealing a stunning display of architectural and artistic detail, from massive, dark marble columns and sections of exposed red brick to the elaborate white marble sculptures and reliefs adorning the walls. The primary focus is a deeply recessed chapel or apse, crowned with a magnificent, gilded dome featuring intricate patterns and figures. Below, a large, dramatic altarpiece painting is enshrined within an elaborate white marble framework, set above what appears to be a reliquary. There is no main subject, as the video's purpose is to immerse the viewer in the overwhelming scale, historical grandeur, and sacred ambiance of the environment itself, with ornate lanterns casting a warm glow that highlights the rich textures throughout the space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an interior scenery shot of a cathedral and follows the panning motion, it relies heavily on subjective adjectives like \"opulent,\" \"reverent,\" \"stunning,\" and \"overwhelming,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions. The description of the gilded dome's \"intricate patterns and figures\" is too vague; it could have specified if these were painted frescoes of angels, geometric mosaics, or coffered panels. Furthermore, the caption mentions a \"dramatic altarpiece painting\" but fails to describe its visible content, such as the biblical scene or figures depicted, which are central to the composition. The phrase \"what appears to be a reliquary\" introduces uncertainty, violating the instruction to only describe what is visible; it would be better to describe its physical form, such as \"a small, glass-fronted gilded box.\" Finally, the concluding sentence is overly interpretive and verbose. A more direct statement that the focus is on the architectural elements would be more effective and concise than speculating on the video's purpose to \"immerse the viewer.\" The description also omits other potentially visible details from the pan, such as the patterned marble floor or the dark, carved wooden pews in the foreground, which would provide a more complete picture of the space.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures the interior of a grand European cathedral, focusing on its architectural and artistic details. The camera pans across the space, highlighting massive dark marble columns, sections of exposed red brick, and elaborate white marble sculptures and reliefs on the walls. The centerpiece is a deeply recessed chapel or apse, crowned with a gilded dome featuring painted frescoes of angels. Below, a large altarpiece painting depicts a biblical scene, framed by an ornate white marble structure, with a small, glass-fronted gilded box beneath it. The video also reveals a patterned marble floor and dark, carved wooden pews in the foreground, with ornate lanterns casting a warm glow that accentuates the rich textures throughout the space. The focus is on the cathedral's architectural elements and historical grandeur.",
