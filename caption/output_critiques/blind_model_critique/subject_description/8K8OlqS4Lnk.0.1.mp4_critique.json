    "pre_caption": "This video presents a suburban scenery shot, capturing a magnificent double rainbow arching across a gray, overcast sky. The primary rainbow is bright and distinct, while a second, fainter arc is visible above it. The scene is framed by elements of a residential neighborhood, including lush green trees, a prominent palm tree on the right, a concrete fence, and power lines stretching across the view. The focus is not on a specific subject but on the overall atmosphere and the natural beauty of the rainbow, with the street-level environment serving as a familiar foreground to the celestial display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a suburban scenery shot and focuses on the double rainbow as the primary feature, it could be improved by adhering more strictly to objective language and incorporating more specific visual details that would likely be present. The use of subjective words like \"magnificent\" and phrases such as \"natural beauty\" and \"celestial display\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional or poetic language. A more effective description would focus on the rainbow's visual characteristics, such as the vividness of its color spectrum or the completeness of its arc. Furthermore, the description of the neighborhood is somewhat generic; I imagine the video shows more specific details, such as the street appearing wet and reflective from recent rain, a specific two-story house with a dark shingled roof partially visible behind the trees, or a red sedan parked in a driveway. Mentioning these concrete details would ground the scene more effectively. Lastly, if the video involves any camera movement, such as a slow pan across the sky or a tilt up from the street level to reveal the rainbow, including this would provide a more accurate and dynamic account of the visual experience, explaining how the elements of the scene are presented to the viewer over time.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a suburban scene featuring a double rainbow against a gray, overcast sky. The primary rainbow displays a vivid color spectrum, while a second, fainter arc is visible above it. The scene includes specific elements of a residential neighborhood: lush green trees, a prominent palm tree on the right, a concrete fence, and power lines. The street appears wet and reflective from recent rain, with a two-story house with a dark shingled roof partially visible behind the trees and a red sedan parked in a driveway. The camera slowly pans across the sky, transitioning from the street level to reveal the full arc of the rainbow, providing a dynamic view of the scene.",
