    "pre_caption": "The central subject is an anthropomorphic Moon, depicted in black and white with a textured, cratered surface that forms a human-like face. This face has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. A large, dark, cylindrical object, shaped like a bullet or a rocket ship, is lodged directly in the Moon's right eye, which is closed as if in reaction. The Moon's overall facial expression suggests discomfort.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the central subjects as an anthropomorphic Moon and a rocket ship and describes their static appearances, it fails to capture the essential action and temporal progression that would be present in the video. The description of the rocket as being \"lodged\" in the Moon's eye treats the scene as a still image rather than a moving sequence. A more effective caption would describe the rocket ship flying through space and then striking the Moon, causing the impact. Furthermore, the video likely shows a change in the Moon's expression; it might appear neutral or observant at first, and then its face would contort upon impact, with its eye closing and smoke or debris puffing out from the collision point. The current caption misses this crucial cause-and-effect narrative. Lastly, the phrase \"suggests discomfort\" is a subjective interpretation of emotion, which should be avoided. Instead, the caption should objectively describe the physical changes in the Moon's face, such as its mouth turning down into a frown or its brow furrowing, to convey the reaction without assigning an emotion.",

Upon impact, the Moon's expression changes as its eye closes, its mouth turns down into a frown, and its brow furrows.
