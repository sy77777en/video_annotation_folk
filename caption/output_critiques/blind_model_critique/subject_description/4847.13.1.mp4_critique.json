    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with dark, curly hair styled up, wearing a light-colored, textured coat with a distinctive collar and button details. She is engaged in an activity at a vanity table, interacting with objects on the surface. Her posture is slightly bent forward, indicating focus on the task at hand. The setting includes a decorative mirror and various items on the table, suggesting a personal or domestic environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the instructions. It is accurate, clear, and provides a strong visual description of the video's subject.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It uses specific, descriptive language to detail the subject's appearance (\"dark, curly hair styled up,\" \"light-colored, textured coat with a distinctive collar and button details\") and her actions (\"engaged in an activity at a vanity table,\" \"posture is slightly bent forward\"). These details paint a precise picture of the scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, focusing on the most salient subject—the woman. It successfully captures her key visual attributes, her posture, and her interaction with her immediate environment. While it mentions \"various items on the table\" without detailing them, this is appropriate as it follows the rule to avoid describing what might be out of focus or unclear. It correctly prioritizes the main subject over the secondary objects.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the video's content in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly identifies the main subject (\"woman\") and describes her in detail before mentioning secondary objects (\"vanity table,\" \"mirror\").\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Simple and Objective Language:** The language is natural and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. Words like \"textured,\" \"decorative,\" and \"distinctive\" are used appropriately to describe visual characteristics.\n*   **Avoids Speculation (with a minor exception):** The caption mostly sticks to what is visible. However, the phrases **\"indicating focus on the task at hand\"** and **\"suggesting a personal or domestic environment\"** are interpretations rather than direct visual descriptions. While they are logical inferences, a stricter adherence to the rules would be to simply state the visual facts (e.g., \"Her posture is slightly bent forward,\" and \"The scene features a woman at a vanity table with a decorative mirror\"). This is a very minor point in an otherwise excellent caption.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is very good. It is a high-quality description that follows nearly all instructions to the letter. The minor point about interpretation is the only area for potential improvement, but it doesn't significantly detract from the caption's overall effectiveness and clarity.",
