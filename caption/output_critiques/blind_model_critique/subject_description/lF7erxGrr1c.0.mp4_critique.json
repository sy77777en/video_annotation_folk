    "pre_caption": "A group of dirt modified race cars, characterized by their open-wheel design, large side panels, and rear spoilers, are on a dirt track. The cars display a variety of color schemes and graphics; one is white with red and black markings, another is black and red, one is white with blue and red accents, and a prominent one is yellow and red. Other cars in the pack include a black vehicle with the number 229 and a blue and yellow car. In the infield area, several non-racing vehicles are present, including a white pickup truck and a white ambulance with red and black stripes. A few people are also in the infield, including a man in a yellow safety vest and another person in a pink shirt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption accurately identifies the types of vehicles and their key features, such as the open-wheel design and color schemes. However, it describes the scene statically, as if from a photograph, rather than capturing the motion inherent in a racing video. The video likely shows these cars actively competing, sliding through turns, and kicking up large clouds of brown dust, details which are missing from the description. The mention of a \"prominent\" yellow and red car is a good start, but the caption should clarify *why* it is prominent—for instance, is it leading the pack, or is the camera tracking it specifically? The description of the infield subjects, like the ambulance and the person in pink pants, feels disconnected from the main event. To improve, the caption should be rewritten to focus on the action, using dynamic verbs to describe the race. For example, you could describe the prominent yellow and red car battling for position with the white and red car as they speed around the track, with the rest of the pack following closely behind them through the dust. The infield elements could then be mentioned as background details the cars are passing, which would create a more cohesive and engaging description of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A thrilling dirt track race unfolds as a group of dirt modified race cars, known for their open-wheel design and striking color schemes, speed around the circuit. The prominent yellow and red car battles fiercely for the lead against a white car with red and black markings, both kicking up clouds of brown dust as they slide through the turns. Close behind, a black and red car and a white car with blue and red accents jostle for position, while a black car numbered 229 and a blue and yellow car race to catch up. In the background, the infield area features a white pickup truck and a white ambulance with red and black stripes, along with a few people, including a man in a yellow safety vest and another in a pink shirt, all watching the high-speed action unfold.",
