  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption accurately identifies the video as a \"seascape scenery shot.\" It correctly points out the key elements that constitute such a scene: the ocean, rocks, and sky. This description is precise and factually correct for a video focused on a coastal environment.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete according to the specific rule for scenery shots. It successfully fulfills the three requirements for this type of video:\n1.  It concisely specifies the type of scenery shot (\"seascape scenery shot\").\n2.  It describes the main components of the environment (\"ocean, rocks, and sky\").\n3.  It explains why there is no main subject, stating that the focus is on the \"atmosphere and scale of the coastal setting.\"\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all the provided instructions:\n\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown formatting.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and directly describes the scene without unnecessary words.\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** It perfectly follows the specific guideline for videos without a salient subject. Instead of forcing a description of an object, it correctly identifies the video's intent to capture a broader environment.\n*   **Avoidance of Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" within the description itself (the first sentence is an acceptable classification as per the instructions for scenery shots).\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives, using neutral terms like \"natural environment\" and \"coastal setting.\"\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the overall scene rather than non-existent or insignificant subjects, as instructed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to apply the provided instructions, particularly the specific rule for describing a scenery shot. It is accurate, complete, and follows every constraint perfectly.",
