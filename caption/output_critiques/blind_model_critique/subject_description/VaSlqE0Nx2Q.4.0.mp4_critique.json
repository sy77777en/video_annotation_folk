    "pre_caption": "The video features a person with medium-length hair, wearing a dark, loose-fitting garment, partially concealed among tall grass. The person’s face is not clearly visible, and their posture suggests they are either standing or slightly crouched within the grass. As the view shifts, a lone figure, likely the same person, appears in the distance, small in scale against a vast expanse of rolling sand dunes with sparse vegetation. The black-and-white presentation emphasizes the contrast between the figure and the landscape, highlighting the person’s isolation and the openness of the environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A black-and-white scene shows tall grass swaying in the foreground, with a person partially hidden in the middle of the grass and distant hills under a cloudy sky in the background. The camera then moves forward beyond the tall grass to reveal an expansive black-and-white landscape of rolling sand dunes and sparse vegetation, with a lone figure visible in the distance, emphasizing the vastness of the scene.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate and adheres to most of the instructions. However, there is a minor area for improvement regarding subjectivity.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is very accurate. It correctly identifies a person in two different contexts: first, partially hidden in tall grass, and second, as a small, distant figure in a vast sand dune landscape. The descriptions of the person's attire (\"dark, loose-fitting garment\"), the environment (\"tall grass,\" \"rolling sand dunes with sparse vegetation\"), and the overall visual style (\"black-and-white presentation\") are all correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive. It successfully synthesizes the two distinct scenes of the video into a single, coherent paragraph. It captures the key subject, the change in their presentation (from partially concealed to a distant figure), and the defining characteristics of the setting in both parts. Mentioning the black-and-white aesthetic is a crucial detail that adds to the completeness of the description.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and succinct summary of the video's content.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly focuses on the person as the main subject and uses the environment for context.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the video as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Proper Language:** It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses simple, natural English.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides good visual details for the subject (\"medium-length hair,\" \"dark, loose-fitting garment\") and the environment.\n*   **Temporal Order:** It correctly describes the scenes in the order they appear, noting the transition with the phrase \"As the view shifts.\"\n*   **Format:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n*   **Avoids Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The final sentence uses the word \"isolation\" (\"highlighting the person’s isolation\"). While the visual evidence (a lone figure in a vast, empty landscape) strongly suggests this feeling, \"isolation\" is an interpretation of an emotional or psychological state, not a direct visual attribute. A more objective description would stick to the visual facts, such as: \"The black-and-white presentation emphasizes the strong contrast between the dark figure and the bright, expansive landscape.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is of high quality and very effective. Its only minor flaw is the use of a subjective term (\"isolation\") which interprets the scene's mood rather than strictly describing its visual components as per the instructions.",
