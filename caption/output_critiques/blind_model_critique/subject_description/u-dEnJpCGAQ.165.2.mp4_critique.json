    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of elephants in a grassy savanna. The elephants, varying in size, are dark gray and appear to be grazing. They are spread out across the scene, with some standing and others possibly lying down or partially obscured by the tall grass. The setting is open and expansive, suggesting a natural habitat. The elephants are the primary subjects, and their presence is consistent throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects as a group of elephants in a savanna and notes their general action and direction of movement. However, it lacks specific visual detail that would be present in the video. For instance, instead of just \"dark gray,\" the description could be more precise, mentioning the characteristically wrinkled texture of their skin and whether it is covered in dust or mud, which might give it a brownish or lighter gray appearance in the sunlight. The caption also misses key distinguishing features like the presence, size, and color of tusks on the adult elephants, or the motion of their large ears flapping as they walk. The description of the group's composition—\"the elephant at the very back appearing to be of similar size to the one at the front, while the elephant in the middle seems smaller\"—is clunky and could be stated more clearly and confidently as \"Two adult elephants walk on either side of a smaller, juvenile elephant,\" which also better implies a family unit. Finally, the last sentence stating that the elephants are the primary subjects and are consistent is redundant meta-commentary; a strong description makes this self-evident without needing to be explicitly stated.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a group of elephants in a grassy savanna, highlighting their characteristically wrinkled skin, which appears brownish or lighter gray due to dust or mud in the sunlight. Two adult elephants, each with large, ivory tusks, walk on either side of a smaller, juvenile elephant, suggesting a family unit. Their large ears flap gently as they move through the open, expansive landscape, grazing on the tall grass. Some elephants stand prominently, while others are partially obscured by the grass, adding depth to the scene.",
