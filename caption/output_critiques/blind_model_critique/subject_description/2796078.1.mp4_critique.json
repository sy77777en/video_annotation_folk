    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with curly brown hair, wearing a beige jacket, holding a small dog with curly fur. The woman is facing away from the camera, and her hair is tied back with a clip. The dog is nestled in her arms, partially visible, with its head turned slightly to the side. As the video progresses, the woman and the dog move out of the frame, leaving behind an outdoor setting with wooden chairs and tables, and a backdrop of greenery and a building with large windows.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good starting point by identifying the woman and the dog as the initial subjects and noting the transition to an outdoor scene. However, it lacks the specific detail needed to create a vivid mental image of the video. For instance, the description of the woman could be enhanced by including her apparent age, such as a young adult, and her pleasant facial expression, as she is smiling slightly. The dog, described only as having 'curly fur,' could be more clearly identified by its color, for example, as a small white dog, possibly a poodle. The most significant area for improvement is the description of the transition; rather than simply 'moving out of the frame,' the woman turns from her initial profile view to face the camera before walking away into the background, an action that purposefully reveals the setting. Finally, the description of the revealed 'outdoor setting' is too general. Specifying it as a 'cafe patio' with 'dark wood tables' and mentioning the presence of other blurred patrons in the background would provide much-needed context. The 'greenery' could be more concretely described as 'large potted plants,' and the 'building' could be identified as a 'modern restaurant,' which would make the description more accurate and immersive.",
