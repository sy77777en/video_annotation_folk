    "pre_caption": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic fox with exaggerated, cartoon-like features. The fox has a large, bushy tail and elongated ears, and its body is drawn with fluid, dynamic lines. It is depicted in a playful pose, interacting with a circular object resembling a plate or disc. The fox's limbs are extended, and its expression appears focused and engaged. The character's design emphasizes agility and expressiveness, typical of animated creatures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\nThe caption is partially successful but has several significant flaws in its adherence to the specific rules outlined in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Good:** The caption accurately identifies the subject type with a precise term: \"animated anthropomorphic fox.\" It also correctly identifies its key features (\"large, bushy tail,\" \"elongated ears\") and its interaction with a \"circular object resembling a plate or disc.\"\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The caption strays from direct visual description into artistic analysis. Phrases like \"drawn with fluid, dynamic lines\" and \"The character's design emphasizes agility and expressiveness, typical of animated creatures\" are interpretations of the art style and character intent, not a description of the subject's visible attributes. The instructions require describing what is seen, not analyzing the design principles behind it.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Good:** The caption identifies the main subject (the fox) and a secondary subject (the circular object), and it describes the subject's pose (\"limbs are extended\").\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The caption is critically incomplete because it completely omits **color**. Color is one of the most fundamental visual attributes for any subject, especially an animated one. The instructions explicitly ask for details like color, and its absence is a major oversight.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some rules well but violates several key negative constraints.\n\n**Strengths (Rules Followed):**\n\n*   It is a single, concise paragraph.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It focuses on the subject and avoids mentioning the background.\n*   It uses precise subject types (\"fox,\" \"object\").\n\n**Weaknesses (Rules Violated):**\n\n*   **Violation: \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"** The caption uses the word \"playful\" to describe the pose. \"Playful\" is a subjective interpretation of the character's mood or intent, which is explicitly forbidden. A more compliant description would stick to the physical orientation, such as \"crouching with its limbs extended.\" Similarly, \"engaged\" is an interpretation of the fox's mental state. \"Focused\" is borderline but more acceptable as it can describe a visible state (e.g., eyes directed at one point).\n*   **Violation: \"Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"** The final sentence, \"The character's design emphasizes agility and expressiveness, typical of animated creatures,\" is entirely analytical. It describes the *purpose* of the design and makes a generalization (\"typical of...\"), which is not a direct visual observation. This is a clear violation of the rule to describe only what is visible.\n*   **Violation: \"Describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language.\"** As mentioned in the completeness section, the failure to describe the **color** of the fox and the object is a significant deviation from this instruction.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption provides a decent starting point by identifying the subject and its general form. However, it fails by including subjective analysis and interpretation while omitting fundamental visual details like color. To be compliant, the caption should be rewritten to remove interpretive language (\"playful,\" \"fluid, dynamic lines,\" the entire final sentence) and add objective, descriptive details, most importantly the colors of the fox and the object.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic fox with exaggerated, cartoon-like features. The fox has a large, bushy orange tail and elongated ears, and its body is drawn with smooth lines. It is depicted in a crouching pose, interacting with a circular object resembling a plate or disc, which is white. The fox's limbs are extended, and its expression appears focused, with eyes directed at the object. The character's design highlights its physical attributes, emphasizing its agility.",
