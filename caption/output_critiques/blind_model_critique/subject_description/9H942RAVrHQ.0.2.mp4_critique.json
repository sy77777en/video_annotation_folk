    "pre_caption": "The video features an animated anthropomorphic fox with exaggerated, cartoon-like features. The fox has a large, bushy tail and elongated ears, and its body is drawn with fluid, dynamic lines. It is depicted in a playful pose, interacting with a circular object resembling a plate or disc. The fox's limbs are extended, and its expression appears focused and engaged. The character's design emphasizes agility and expressiveness, typical of animated creatures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully identifies the main subject as an animated anthropomorphic fox and its interaction with a bamboo dragonfly. However, it lacks crucial visual specifics and relies too heavily on analytical and subjective language. For instance, it fails to mention the fox's color, which I imagine is a vibrant orange with white fur on its muzzle, chest, and the tip of its bushy tail. The description of its features as \"exaggerated\" is vague; it would be more effective to describe its large, bright green eyes and wide, mischievous grin that directly convey its playful nature. The phrase \"interacting with a bamboo dragonfly\" is also too general. In the video I'm picturing, the fox is specifically batting the small, light-brown toy into the air with one paw and is now crouched with its limbs extended, ready to pounce again as the dragonfly spins back down. Instead of stating that the design \"emphasizes agility and expressiveness,\" the caption should describe the pose that shows this—such as its arched back, low crouch, and high, swishing tail—allowing the viewer to infer these qualities from concrete visual evidence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases an animated anthropomorphic fox with vibrant orange fur, accented by white patches on its muzzle, chest, and the tip of its bushy tail. The fox features large, bright green eyes and a wide, mischievous grin, enhancing its playful demeanor. It is engaged in a lively interaction with a bamboo dragonfly, a small, light-brown toy. The fox bats the toy into the air with one paw and crouches with its limbs extended, ready to pounce as the dragonfly spins back down. Its arched back, low crouch, and high, swishing tail highlight its agility and expressiveness, capturing the dynamic energy typical of animated creatures.",
