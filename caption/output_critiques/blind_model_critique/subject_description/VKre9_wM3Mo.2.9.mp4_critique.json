    "pre_caption": "A white, semi-translucent toilet is positioned in the center of a solid black background. The toilet has its lid open, revealing the interior of the bowl, which is illuminated from within by a bright, cool blue light. A soft, white spotlight shines on the surface directly beneath the toilet, creating a gentle glow that fades into the darkness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a white, semi-translucent toilet with an internal blue light against a black background, it misses several key dynamic aspects of the video. The description portrays a static image rather than a sequence of events. For example, the video begins with the toilet unlit, and after a few seconds, the blue light flickers on and then brightens to a steady, pulsing glow, a detail the caption omits entirely. The caption also fails to mention the other visible parts of the subject, such as the toilet tank and a chrome flush handle on its right side, which are also rendered in the same semi-translucent material and catch the blue light. Furthermore, the phrase \"seems to represent water\" is subjective and interpretive; a more accurate description would simply state that a bright, cool blue light emanates from the bowl. The \"soft light source\" beneath the toilet is not separate but is clearly a reflection of the internal blue light on the glossy black surface, and the caption should specify this relationship to provide a more precise and objective account of the visual information.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a white, semi-translucent toilet positioned in the center of a solid black background. Initially unlit, the toilet's interior gradually comes to life as a bright, cool blue light flickers on and then brightens to a steady, pulsing glow. The toilet's tank and chrome flush handle on its right side, also made of the same semi-translucent material, catch and reflect the blue light. The glow from the bowl creates a reflection on the glossy black surface beneath, enhancing the visual effect and seamlessly blending into the surrounding darkness.",
