    "pre_caption": "The video features a gumball machine with a beige base and a transparent globe containing multicolored gumballs. The machine has a metal lever and a dispensing slot. Initially, the gumballs are inside the globe, but by the end, several gumballs are dispensed onto a flat surface in front of the machine. The gumballs are various colors, including red, blue, and brown, and they are scattered across the surface. The machine and gumballs are the central focus, with the action centered around the dispensing of the gumballs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **good**, but with minor room for improvement. It successfully captures the main subject and action of the video while adhering to most of the key instructions.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"gumball machine\" and its contents as \"gumballs.\" The described attributes (beige base, transparent globe, metal lever, multicolored gumballs) and the action (dispensing) are a precise representation of what happens in such a video.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description is very complete. It covers the initial state of the subjects (gumballs in the globe) and their final state (gumballs dispensed on a surface), effectively summarizing the entire event. It includes sufficient detail about both the machine and the gumballs.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, clear paragraph that gets straight to the point.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"gumball machine,\" \"gumballs\") and avoids vague language.\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details like \"beige base,\" \"transparent globe,\" \"metal lever,\" and the colors of the gumballs (\"red, blue, and brown\").\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" within the description itself.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The description is free of subjective or emotional adjectives.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The phrase \"Initially... but by the end\" segments the video chronologically. While it effectively describes the change, it slightly goes against the instruction to \"describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one.\" A more integrated way to describe the action would be to phrase it as a continuous process. For example: \"...a gumball machine with a beige base and a transparent globe that dispenses several multicolored gumballs onto a flat surface in front of it.\"\n    *   The final sentence, \"The machine and gumballs are the central focus, with the action centered around the dispensing of the gumballs,\" is meta-commentary. It describes the composition and focus of the video rather than the subjects themselves. The instructions ask for a direct description of the subjects, and this information is already implied by the preceding sentences. Removing this sentence would make the caption more concise and direct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is accurate, clear, and follows most of the complex rules. To make it excellent, it could rephrase the description of the action to be more fluid and remove the final sentence, which analyzes the video's focus instead of simply describing the content.",
