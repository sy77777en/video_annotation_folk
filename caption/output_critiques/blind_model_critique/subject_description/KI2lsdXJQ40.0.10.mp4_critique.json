    "pre_caption": "The video features a pair of dark brown, worn leather shoes and a black hard-shell suitcase with silver latches and a partially open lid. The shoes are positioned upright and close together, showing visible creases and scuffs, suggesting frequent use. The suitcase is medium-sized, rectangular, and sits on the floor with its lid propped open, revealing a glimpse of light-colored clothing or fabric inside. At one point, the shoes are seen outside the suitcase, and later, they appear to be inside the suitcase, with the lid partially closed over them. No people or other living beings are visible, and the focus remains on the shoes and suitcase as the primary subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good baseline, it lacks the specific visual details that make the video compelling. For instance, the \"dark brown, worn leather shoes\" are more specifically men's oxford dress shoes, with deep creases across the top and distinct scuff marks on the toes, giving them a sense of history. The most significant oversight is the description of their movement; rather than just \"moving on their own,\" the shoes animate in a clear stop-motion style, taking short, jerky hops with one shoe leading the other as they cautiously approach and climb into the suitcase. The \"blue hard-shell suitcase\" also has more defining features, such as a matte, ribbed texture and four visible spinner wheels at its base. Inside, the \"light-colored clothing\" is identifiable as a neatly folded white collared shirt. Lastly, the action of the lid closing is more nuanced; it doesn't just \"begin to close,\" but rather it pauses for a moment after the shoes are inside before shutting smoothly and deliberately, adding a dramatic finality to the sequence that the current description misses.",
