    "pre_caption": "A worn, pinkish-brown teddy bear is the central subject. The plush bear has a fuzzy, slightly matted texture and visible stitching, giving it an aged appearance. It features mismatched eyes: one is a large, dark, four-holed button, while the other is a smaller, dark bead. A small, dark, shiny piece forms its nose above a stitched mouth. Around its neck is a faded pink scarf tied in a knot. A light-skinned human hand places a dark gray, soft cap on the bear's head. The cap, made of a fabric or leather-like material with prominent stitching, has a button on its side that matches the bear's button eye.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video takes place in a home setting. It starts with a background featuring a chair, a vanity, and a rocking horse. A hand then places a plush bear on the floor in the foreground, showing its upper body. The focus shifts to the bear, and the hand puts a hat on its head.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the central subject as a \"pinkish-brown teddy bear\" and precisely describes its key features, such as the \"fuzzy, slightly matted texture,\" \"visible stitching,\" and \"mismatched eyes\" (one a button, one a bead). The description of the \"light-skinned human hand\" placing a \"dark gray, soft cap\" on the bear's head is also a correct representation of the action. The detail about the button on the cap matching the bear's button eye is an excellent and accurate observation.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It captures all the essential visual information without being overly long. It describes the main subject (the bear) in great detail, then introduces the secondary subjects (the hand and the cap) in the context of their interaction with the main subject. It successfully describes the materials, colors, and unique characteristics of all subjects involved, leaving the reader with a clear and thorough mental picture of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the entire event (placing the cap on the bear) without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types like \"teddy bear\" and \"human hand.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives. Terms like \"worn\" and \"aged\" are used appropriately as they are supported by visual evidence mentioned in the caption (\"matted texture,\" \"visible stitching\").\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing visual attributes, such as the bear's mismatched eyes, the cap's material, and the faded color of the scarf.\n*   **Subject Hierarchy:** It correctly identifies the bear as the \"central subject\" and structures the description around it, introducing the hand and cap as they interact with the bear.\n*   **Action Description:** It clearly describes the key action (\"places a... cap on the bear's head\"), which is essential to understanding the video.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A pinkish-brown teddy bear, with a worn and fuzzy texture, is the central focus. Its aged appearance is highlighted by visible stitching and mismatched eyes: one a large, dark button, the other a smaller bead. A small, shiny piece forms its nose above a stitched mouth, and a faded pink scarf is tied around its neck. A light-skinned hand gently places a dark gray, soft cap on the bear's head. The cap, featuring prominent stitching and a button that matches the bear's button eye, adds to the bear's charmingly vintage look.",
