    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned man with short, light-colored hair is shown hanging by his hands. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants. His face is contorted in an expression of physical strain as he struggles, pulling his body upward and swinging his legs. The perspective on the man changes, shifting from a close-up of his upper body to a wider view that shows his entire body dangling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video has a **main subject with dynamic size**, so the description should focus on them. Don't mention the background scene and other motion.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that closely follows the provided instructions. It is accurate, concise, and informative.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the subject and his actions. It correctly identifies a man who is \"hanging by his hands,\" wearing the specified clothing, and exhibiting physical effort (\"pulling his body upward and swinging his legs\"). The description of the changing perspective from a close-up to a wider view is also a precise account of the video's composition.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, providing key visual details without becoming overly long. It covers the subject's gender, skin tone, hair, clothing, and facial expression. It also effectively describes his posture and actions. It correctly omits details that are likely not visible or are speculative, adhering to the instruction to \"avoid describing what is not visible.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong adherence to the specific rules outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet provides a clear mental image of the video's content.\n*   **Focus on the Subject:** The entire description is focused on the man, his attributes, and his actions, correctly ignoring the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Avoids Subjective Emotion:** The phrase \"expression of physical strain\" is a perfect choice. It describes the man's facial contortion as a physical reaction rather than assigning a subjective emotion like \"pained\" or \"determined,\" which would have violated the instructions.\n*   **Describes Key Attributes:** It details the man's clothing (\"light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants\"), hair (\"short, light-colored hair\"), and skin tone (\"light-skinned\").\n*   **Handles Shot Transitions:** The final sentence, \"The perspective on the man changes, shifting from a close-up of his upper body to a wider view that shows his entire body dangling,\" is an exemplary way to handle a shot transition. It explains the change clearly and concisely without using technical jargon.\n*   **Formatting:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English, as required.\n\nThe only minor point for improvement would be to replace the passive phrase \"is shown\" with a more active voice (e.g., \"A light-skinned man... hangs by his hands\"). However, this is a minor stylistic point, and the caption as written is clear and effective.",
