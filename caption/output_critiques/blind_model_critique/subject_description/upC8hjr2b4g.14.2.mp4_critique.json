    "pre_caption": "This video presents an atmospheric interior scenery shot of a desolate hallway. At the far end, a closed door stands beneath a light fixture that initially bathes the entire corridor in an intense, ominous red glow. This alarming light flickers and then abruptly shuts off, plunging the scene into near-complete darkness. The only remaining illumination is a faint, cool light filtering through a paned window on the left wall, leaving the hallway looking cold and mysterious. The focus is not on a particular subject but on the environment itself, using the dramatic shift from a threatening red to a desolate darkness to build a powerful sense of suspense and unease.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an interior scenery shot and captures the central event of the light changing, it deviates significantly from the instructions by using highly subjective and emotional language. Words like \"ominous,\" \"alarming,\" \"threatening,\" \"mysterious,\" \"suspense,\" and \"unease\" are interpretive and violate the rule to avoid adjectives that convey emotion. The description should be objective, stating that the hallway is lit by a \"saturated red light\" rather than an \"ominous red glow.\" Furthermore, the caption lacks specific visual detail that would be present in the video; for example, it could have mentioned the hallway's peeling wallpaper, the dark wood of the floor, the specific industrial design of the bare-bulb light fixture, or the arched shape of the paned window. The final sentence, which analyzes the filmmaker's intent to \"build a powerful sense of suspense,\" is an interpretation, not a description of the visual content. A more accurate caption would have focused on observable facts, such as how the red light is brightest at the far end of the hall and fades toward the foreground, and how after it extinguishes, the faint light from the window creates a distinct rectangular pattern on the opposite wall, leaving the door at the end as a solid black silhouette.",
