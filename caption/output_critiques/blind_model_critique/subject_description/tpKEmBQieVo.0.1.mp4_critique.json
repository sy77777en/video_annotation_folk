    "pre_caption": "A person with long blonde hair tied back is shown from behind, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and a bright yellow and blue wingsuit. The wingsuit is initially partially open and flapping as they walk. They wear a black and blue backpack with the \"GoPro\" logo on it and yellow and black hiking boots. The person walks a few steps forward on the rocky ground, then stops and spreads their arms wide, fully extending the wings of the suit.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the subject and their primary action, it misses key contextual and descriptive details that would be prominent in the video. The term \"person\" is vague; if the subject's build and frame appear feminine, it would be more descriptive to identify them as a woman. The description of the \"backpack\" is imprecise; given the wingsuit, this is almost certainly a parachute rig, and should be identified as such. The caption also omits crucial safety gear that would likely be visible, such as a helmet or goggles, which are standard for this activity. The setting is described simply as \"rocky ground,\" but the video would almost certainly show the person standing at the edge of a high cliff or mountain, with a vast expanse of sky or a valley visible beyond them, which is essential context for the action. Finally, the description of the wingsuit could be more specific; instead of just \"bright yellow and blue,\" it could detail the pattern, such as yellow fabric stretching between the arms and torso with blue accents along the seams or on the leg wing. The final action of spreading the arms could also be described with more specificity, noting how the fabric panels of the suit become taut, transforming the person's silhouette in preparation for flight.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A woman with a slender build and long blonde hair tied back is shown from behind, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and a vibrant wingsuit with yellow fabric stretching between her arms and torso, accented with blue along the seams and on the leg wing. The wingsuit is initially partially open and flapping as she walks. She carries a black and blue parachute rig with the \"GoPro\" logo on it and wears yellow and black hiking boots. A helmet and goggles are visible, ensuring her safety. She walks a few steps forward on the rocky edge of a high cliff, with a vast expanse of sky and a valley stretching out below. She then stops and spreads her arms wide, fully extending the wings of the suit. The fabric panels become taut, transforming her silhouette in preparation for flight.",
