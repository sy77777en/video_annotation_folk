    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with light skin and short, light-colored hair, who appears to be the main subject. He is speaking at a press event, surrounded by microphones and cameras, indicating a public setting. The man is wearing a dark suit and is positioned centrally, suggesting he is the focus of attention. Around him, several people are visible, including a person in a striped shirt holding a camera, and another individual with dark hair partially obscured by equipment. The scene is crowded, with the main subject addressing the media, highlighting a formal and possibly tense atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and general setting, it lacks specific visual details and includes subjective interpretations that should be avoided. For instance, describing the man as \"slightly overweight\" and the atmosphere as \"possibly tense\" is interpretive; a more objective description would be \"a heavy-set man\" and would omit any mention of atmosphere. The caption also misses key details about his attire and actions; in the video, the man is wearing a dark red tie with his suit and is actively gesturing with his right hand for emphasis as he speaks. The description of the press equipment is too generic; the video clearly shows a cluster of microphones on the podium, several bearing the distinct logos of major news networks, and the cameras include both large, tripod-mounted broadcast cameras and smaller DSLRs held by reporters. Furthermore, the secondary subjects are described too vaguely; the \"person in a striped shirt\" is a woman with a blue and white striped blouse focusing a large telephoto lens, and the \"individual with dark hair\" is a man whose back is to the viewer, holding a boom microphone. A better caption would incorporate these specific, observable details to create a more accurate and vivid picture of the scene without resorting to subjective analysis.",
