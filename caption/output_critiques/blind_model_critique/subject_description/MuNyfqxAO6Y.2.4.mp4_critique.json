    "pre_caption": "A silver, modified Nissan GT-R is positioned on the left side of a street at night, viewed from a rear three-quarters angle. The car is equipped with a large, black rear wing that has \"PANDEM\" written in white on its side plate, and it features a widebody kit with flared fenders. Its four signature circular taillights are illuminated in bright red, as is a single, smaller circular light at the bottom center of the rear bumper. A white Japanese license plate with green characters, including the number \"1 08,\" is visible on the trunk. In the midground to the right, a dark-colored minivan or SUV is seen from the rear with its taillights on.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"modified Nissan GT-R\" and precisely details its specific features, such as the \"PANDEM\" branding on the large, black rear wing, the widebody kit, and the signature quad circular taillights. It also accurately notes the color of the car (\"silver\"), the state of the lights (\"illuminated in bright red\"), and the specific details on the Japanese license plate (\"white... with green characters, including the number '1 08'\"). The description of the secondary vehicle as a \"dark-colored minivan or SUV\" is also accurate, correctly conveying the ambiguity of its exact model.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive without being verbose. It follows the instruction to describe the main subject in detail while briefly mentioning the secondary one. It captures all the salient visual information:\n*   **Subject Types:** \"Nissan GT-R,\" \"minivan or SUV.\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It details color, modifications, specific parts (wing, fenders), markings (\"PANDEM,\" license plate), and lighting for the main car.\n*   **Spatial Information:** It effectively uses location (\"on the left side,\" \"in the midground to the right\") and orientation (\"viewed from a rear three-quarters angle\") to build a clear mental picture of the scene, as permitted by the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It delivers a rich description in a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The description is centered entirely on the two vehicles, avoiding unnecessary details about the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"silver,\" \"large,\" \"circular\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses specific terms like \"Nissan GT-R,\" \"rear wing,\" and \"widebody kit.\"\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It correctly prioritizes the main subject (the GT-R) with a detailed description and then concisely mentions the secondary subject, distinguishing them by location and appearance.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required.",
