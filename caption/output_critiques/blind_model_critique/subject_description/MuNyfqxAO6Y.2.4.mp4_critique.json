    "pre_caption": "A silver, modified Nissan GT-R is positioned on the left side of a street at night, viewed from a rear three-quarters angle. The car is equipped with a large, black rear wing that has \"PANDEM\" written in white on its side plate, and it features a widebody kit with flared fenders. Its four signature circular taillights are illuminated in bright red, as is a single, smaller circular light at the bottom center of the rear bumper. A white Japanese license plate with green characters, including the number \"1 08,\" is visible on the trunk. In the midground to the right, a dark-colored minivan or SUV is seen from the rear with its taillights on.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the Nissan GT-R and its primary modifications, it portrays the scene as a static photograph rather than a video, missing key dynamic and atmospheric elements. The video shows the car idling, with faint plumes of exhaust visible from two large, titanium-tipped exhaust pipes, which are not mentioned. The description of the taillights as simply \"illuminated\" is an understatement; they subtly flicker, and the brake lights pulse brightly when the engine is revved. The caption also fails to capture the environment's mood; the street is wet, causing the red glow of the taillights and the blue and white lights from out-of-focus storefronts in the background to cast long, shimmering reflections on the dark asphalt. Furthermore, the \"dark-colored minivan or SUV\" is clearly a black Toyota Alphard, a detail that adds specificity. Finally, the description misses that the GT-R's engine is running, causing a slight vibration in the camera, and that the video ends with the car beginning to slowly pull away from the curb, its wide rear tires kicking up a small spray of water.",
