    "pre_caption": "The video features a man skateboarding along a sidewalk. He is wearing a white cap, a brown short-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers. The man is captured from behind, showcasing his dynamic posture as he balances on the skateboard. His movement is fluid, indicating skill and control. The setting includes urban elements like a brick wall and parked vehicles, but the focus remains on the man's skateboarding activity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, although it is accurate in its description.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a man skateboarding. The details provided, such as the clothing (white cap, brown short-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, white sneakers) and the action (skateboarding on a sidewalk, seen from behind), are specific and plausible for such a video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is reasonably complete for a concise summary. It correctly identifies the main subject, his attire, and his action. It also briefly notes the surrounding environment (brick wall, parked vehicles) to provide context, which is appropriate.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is where the caption has significant issues. It violates several explicit rules:\n\n1.  **Forbidden Introductory Text and Words:** The instructions state, \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text\" and \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is forbidden introductory text and also uses the word \"video.\"\n2.  **Use of Subjective/Inferential Language:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to focus on visual attributes. The caption uses phrases like \"dynamic posture,\" \"movement is fluid,\" and \"indicating skill and control.\" While \"dynamic\" can be a visual descriptor, \"fluid,\" \"skill,\" and \"control\" are interpretations of the action, not direct visual descriptions. They are subjective judgments about the quality of the man's skateboarding.\n3.  **Unnecessary Mention of Background/Focus:** The instructions say, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects...\" The caption mentions the background and then explicitly states, \"...but the focus remains on the man's skateboarding activity.\" This is a meta-commentary about the video's composition rather than a direct description of the scene itself, which is not in line with the instructions.\n\n### Improved Example\nTo better adhere to the instructions, the caption should be rewritten to be a direct, objective description. For example:\n\n\"A man wearing a white cap, a brown short-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers rides a skateboard along a sidewalk. He is viewed from behind as he balances on the board, moving past a brick wall and parked vehicles.\"",
