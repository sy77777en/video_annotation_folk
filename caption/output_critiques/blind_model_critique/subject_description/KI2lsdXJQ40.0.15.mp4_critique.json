    "pre_caption": "The video features several small, boxy cars with simple, angular shapes and solid colors such as white, black, and gray. These cars have minimal detailing, with flat surfaces and basic windows, and they appear to be made from a material resembling painted cardboard or plastic. The cars are positioned on a wide, flat surface, and some are grouped together while others are spaced apart. Orange traffic cones with white stripes are also present, arranged in a line near one of the cars. The overall appearance of the vehicles and objects suggests they are part of a miniature or model scene rather than full-sized, real-world subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects as \"small, boxy cars\" and secondary subjects as \"orange traffic cones.\" The descriptions of their visual attributes—such as the cars' \"simple, angular shapes,\" \"solid colors,\" \"minimal detailing,\" and the cones' \"white stripes\"—are precise. The observation that they appear to be made of \"painted cardboard or plastic\" and are part of a \"miniature or model scene\" is a crucial and accurate inference that correctly contextualizes the subjects.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It covers all the salient subjects and their key features. It describes not only what the subjects are but also their material, condition, and spatial arrangement (\"some are grouped together while others are spaced apart,\" \"arranged in a line\"). It successfully paints a full picture of the scene without omitting any important visual information.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to all instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and packed with relevant detail.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the cars and cones, mentioning the surface only to provide necessary context for their position.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses descriptive, neutral language (\"boxy,\" \"angular,\" \"orange\") and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Handling Uncertainty:** It correctly uses cautious phrasing like \"appear to be\" and \"suggests\" when describing the material and the nature of the scene, which is an excellent way to avoid stating unconfirmed details as fact.\n*   **Subject Identification and Detail:** It uses precise terms (\"cars,\" \"traffic cones\") and provides detailed visual attributes for each.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It correctly identifies the cars as the primary group of subjects and describes them collectively, which is the appropriate strategy for a scene with multiple similar items and no single focal point.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions perfectly. It is accurate, comprehensive, and meticulously crafted to be objective and clear. The description is detailed enough for a reader to visualize the scene accurately while remaining concise and well-structured.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a collection of small, boxy cars characterized by simple, angular shapes and solid colors like white, black, and gray. These cars feature minimal detailing, with flat surfaces and basic windows, and seem to be constructed from a material similar to painted cardboard or plastic. They are arranged on a wide, flat surface, with some cars grouped together and others spaced apart. Additionally, orange traffic cones with white stripes are lined up near one of the cars. The overall appearance of the vehicles and objects indicates they are part of a miniature or model scene rather than full-sized, real-world subjects.",
