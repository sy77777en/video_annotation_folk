    "pre_caption": "The video begins focused on a male-presenting humanoid figure with a featureless, metallic silver head that has a red glow on its sides. The figure is wearing a light blue, long-sleeved button-down shirt, a dark grey tie, and dark blue trousers, and its metallic silver hands are resting on its lap as it sits in a black chair. The camera then pans to the left to reveal a female-presenting humanoid figure sitting in a similar chair. This figure also has a featureless, metallic silver head, which has a blue glow on its sides and hair styled in a bun. She is dressed in a light grey pantsuit with a white shirt underneath, and she sits with her legs crossed and her metallic silver hands on her lap.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two subjects as humanoid figures with distinct male and female presentations. All the described visual details—the metallic silver heads, the red and blue side glows, the specific clothing items and their colors (light blue shirt, dark grey tie, light grey pantsuit), the metallic hands, and the seated poses—are precise and true to the visual information in the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It captures all the essential and distinguishing features of both subjects without getting lost in minor background details. It provides a full picture by describing the head, clothing, hands, and posture for each figure, fulfilling the instruction to describe key visual attributes in detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of detail into a clear, readable paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The entire description is dedicated to the two figures.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Proper Use of Motion:** It correctly mentions the camera pan (\"pans to the left\") because it is necessary to explain how the second subject is revealed.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption uses neutral, descriptive language and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** The use of \"male-presenting humanoid figure\" and \"female-presenting humanoid figure\" is an excellent choice. It is precise, acknowledges their non-human nature, and explains the gendered styling without making assumptions.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing clothing, material (metallic), color, and pose for both subjects.\n*   **Order and Transitions:** It correctly describes the subjects in the order they appear and clearly explains the camera movement that transitions from the first subject to the second.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.",
