    "pre_caption": "A close-up of a single matchstick with a red, granular head on a light-colored wooden stick is shown. The matchstick ignites in a bright flash, and its head is consumed by a steady, teardrop-shaped flame that is yellow-orange with a blue base. As the flame burns, the head transforms into a black, porous, and charred mass. The flame eventually goes out, leaving the burnt, blackened head, from which a thin wisp of white smoke briefly rises.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a strong, chronologically accurate description of the matchstick's life cycle, it misses key visual details that would likely be present in such a close-up video. The description begins with the matchstick already ignited, omitting the initial, crucial action of the red head being struck against a rough, dark striker surface, which would create the friction for the \"bright flash.\" The flame is described as \"steady,\" which is unlikely for a match; a more accurate description would likely include its flickering or dancing movement as it reacts to air currents. Furthermore, as the flame consumes the head, the caption fails to mention that the top portion of the light-colored wooden stick itself would also begin to blacken and char, not just the head. Finally, the phrase \"the flame eventually goes out\" is too general; a more specific visual description, such as the flame sputtering and shrinking as it runs out of fuel or being abruptly stretched and extinguished, would be more evocative. The description of the smoke could also be enhanced by noting its curling, twisting motion as it rises and dissipates.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a close-up of a single matchstick, its red, granular head poised against a rough, dark striker surface. As the match is struck, friction ignites the head in a bright flash. The flame flickers and dances, reacting to subtle air currents, as it consumes the matchstick. The yellow-orange flame, with a blue base, steadily transforms the head into a black, porous, and charred mass, while the top portion of the light-colored wooden stick also begins to blacken and char. As the flame runs out of fuel, it sputters and shrinks before being abruptly extinguished. A thin wisp of white smoke rises, curling and twisting as it dissipates into the air.",
