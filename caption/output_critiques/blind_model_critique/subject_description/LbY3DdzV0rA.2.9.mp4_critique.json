    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm developing over a desert at dusk. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric power of the natural environment. The sky is filled with a massive, churning storm cloud, its dark purple and grey masses brilliantly illuminated from within by flashes of lightning, creating spectacular bursts of white and pink light. Below the turbulent cloud cover, sheets of rain fall over a distant mountain range, which is silhouetted against the warm, orange glow of the setting sun on the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a landscape shot focused on a thunderstorm and follows the structural guideline of explaining the absence of a main subject, it could be significantly improved by adhering more closely to the instructions regarding objectivity and detail. The caption uses subjective, emotional language such as \"dramatic,\" \"powerful,\" and \"spectacular,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions of the storm's visual characteristics. For example, instead of a \"powerful thunderstorm,\" a more accurate description might be \"a vast, dense storm system.\" Furthermore, the description is missing key details that would likely be present in the video; it fails to mention any foreground elements, such as the dark silhouettes of saguaro cacti or desert scrub, which would provide crucial context and a sense of scale against the immense sky. The description of the lightning is also too general. A more informative caption would distinguish between the different types of visible lightning, such as the \"diffuse, internal flashes of sheet lightning that cause the cloud mass to glow\" and the \"distinct, branching bolts of lightning that arc downwards toward the mountains.\" Finally, the description of the light could be more precise, detailing how the \"warm, orange band of light from the set sun on the horizon\" contrasts with the cool blues and purples of the storm clouds above, rather than just stating its presence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This landscape video captures a vast, dense storm system developing over a desert at dusk. The focus is on the immense scale and atmospheric dynamics of the natural environment. The sky is dominated by a massive, churning storm cloud, with dark purple and grey masses illuminated from within by diffuse, internal flashes of sheet lightning, causing the cloud to glow. Distinct, branching bolts of lightning arc downwards toward the silhouetted mountain range in the distance. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of saguaro cacti and desert scrub provide context and a sense of scale against the expansive sky. Sheets of rain fall over the mountains, silhouetted against a warm, orange band of light from the setting sun on the horizon, which contrasts with the cool blues and purples of the storm clouds above.",
