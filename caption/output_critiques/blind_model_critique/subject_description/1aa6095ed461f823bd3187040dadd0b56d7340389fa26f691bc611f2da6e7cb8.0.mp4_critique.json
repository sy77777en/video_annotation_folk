    "pre_caption": "The video features a silver laptop with a sleek design, open on a wooden surface. The screen displays a digital map interface with detailed geographical features, including roads, rivers, and green areas representing parks or forests. The map shows different locations and routes, with a blue line indicating a specific path or direction. The laptop's keyboard is visible, featuring a standard layout with black keys. The map interface includes a sidebar with additional information, such as location details and navigation options. The overall focus is on the map displayed on the laptop screen, highlighting its use for navigation or route planning.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has minor areas for improvement.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"silver laptop\" and accurately describes the content on its screen as a \"digital map interface\" with specific features like roads, rivers, a blue line for a route, and a sidebar. The description of the physical attributes of the laptop (silver, open, black keys) and its placement (on a wooden surface) is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete, covering all the salient subjects and their key visual attributes in detail. It provides enough information for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Format:** It correctly follows the single-paragraph format without any introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is clear, and it combines details from the entire scene into a coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"laptop\" and \"digital map interface\" instead of vague words.\n    *   **Attribute Detail:** It provides excellent detail on visual attributes (e.g., \"silver laptop,\" \"black keys,\" \"blue line indicating a specific path\").\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states to \"avoid subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses the word **\"sleek\"** to describe the laptop's design, which is a subjective quality. A more objective description would focus only on observable attributes like color, material, or shape.\n    *   **Interpretive Language:** The final sentence, \"The overall focus is on the map displayed on the laptop screen, highlighting its use for navigation or route planning,\" is more of an interpretation of the video's purpose rather than a direct visual description. The instructions ask to describe what is visible, and while the *use* is implied, stating the \"focus\" is a meta-commentary. The detailed description of the map already effectively implies its purpose.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that more strictly adheres to all instructions:\n\nA silver laptop is open on a wooden surface. Its screen displays a digital map interface with detailed geographical features, including roads, rivers, and green areas. The map shows various locations and routes, with a solid blue line indicating a specific path. The laptop's keyboard, which has black keys in a standard layout, is visible below the screen. The map interface also includes a sidebar containing text and navigation options.",
