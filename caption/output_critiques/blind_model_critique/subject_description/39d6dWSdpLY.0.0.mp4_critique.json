    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a vehicle moving along a long, cracked asphalt road. The road stretches into the distance, leading the eye toward a majestic range of snow-capped mountains illuminated by the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset. The surrounding terrain is an arid plain covered in low, dry brush under a clear blue sky. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the vast scale of the natural environment and evoke the feeling of a journey through an open, expansive landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot from a moving vehicle, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The description uses subjective language such as \"majestic\" and \"warm,\" and it interprets the video's intent by stating it is \"designed to...evoke the feeling of a journey,\" which should be avoided in favor of objective visual details. The phrase \"either sunrise or sunset\" introduces uncertainty, violating the rule to only describe what is visible; it would be better to describe the light's qualities, such as \"low-angled golden light.\" The caption also misses some plausible key details that would enhance its accuracy. For example, the perspective from a vehicle often includes a portion of the car's hood or dashboard at the bottom of the view, which is a persistent foreground object that should be mentioned. Furthermore, the \"clear blue sky\" might be an oversimplification, as a sunrise or sunset scene would likely include clouds tinged with orange and pink hues near the horizon. Adding specifics like the color of the lane markings on the asphalt road would also provide a more complete and precise visual account.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a landscape scene from the perspective of a moving vehicle, with a portion of the car's hood visible in the foreground. The camera follows a long, cracked asphalt road with yellow lane markings, stretching into the distance toward a range of snow-capped mountains. These mountains are bathed in low-angled golden light, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. The surrounding terrain is an arid plain dotted with low, dry brush. Above, the sky features a gradient of blue transitioning to orange and pink hues near the horizon, adding depth to the scene. The composition highlights the vastness of the natural environment, offering a detailed view of the expansive landscape.",
