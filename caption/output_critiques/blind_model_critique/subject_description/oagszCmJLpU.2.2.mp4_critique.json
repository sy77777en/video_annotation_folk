    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a powerful thunderstorm at night over a vast, dark plain. The video's focus is on the environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the immense scale and power of the storm rather than a specific main subject. The sky is filled with deep blue and black turbulent clouds, which are continuously and dramatically illuminated from within by pulsating flashes of pink, purple, and white lightning, creating a spectacular and ominous light show against the dark horizon. A single, tiny, steady yellow light is visible in the far distance on the left, accentuating the vastness of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape shot of a nighttime thunderstorm, it misses several key visual details and contains some inaccuracies. The description of the lightning is incomplete; in addition to the pulsating flashes within the clouds, the video clearly shows several distinct, forked bolts of brilliant white lightning striking the ground on the right side of the frame. The characterization of the landscape as a 'vast, dark plain' is also imprecise, as the brightest flashes reveal the clear silhouette of a low, jagged mountain range along the horizon, adding significant depth. Furthermore, the 'single, tiny, steady yellow light' is misidentified; the video actually shows a pair of red lights that blink in unison, suggesting a distant communications tower. Lastly, the caption uses subjective adjectives like 'spectacular' and 'ominous,' which could be improved by using more objective language to describe the high frequency and intensity of the lightning strikes.",
