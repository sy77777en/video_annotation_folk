    "pre_caption": "The video features a large group of horses gathered closely together. The horses display a variety of colors, including shades of brown, black, and white. They are positioned in a dense formation, suggesting movement or a gathering. The scene captures the collective presence of the horses, emphasizing their numbers and diversity in color.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is decent but could be significantly improved. It follows some instructions well but falls short on others, particularly regarding detail and descriptive precision.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"group of horses\" and accurately notes their varied colors and close proximity. There are no factual errors in what is stated.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete. The instructions ask for a description of \"key visual attributes in detail.\" The caption only mentions color (\"shades of brown, black, and white\") and formation (\"gathered closely together,\" \"dense formation\"). It lacks other potential key details that would likely be visible, such as:\n*   Specific markings (e.g., patches, spots, blazes on their faces).\n*   The appearance of their manes and tails (e.g., color, length).\n*   Their general build or breed, if discernible.\n*   Their specific poses or orientations (e.g., \"some are facing forward while others are seen in profile\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses the precise term \"horses.\"\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use \"image,\" \"frame,\" or subjective emotional adjectives.\n*   **Group Description:** It correctly follows the guideline for describing multiple subjects without a clear focus by treating them as a collective group.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere:**\n\n*   **Lacks Detail:** The primary failure is not providing enough detail. The instruction to \"describe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language\" is not fully met. The description is too general.\n*   **Uses Inference:** The phrase \"suggesting movement or a gathering\" is an interpretation, not a direct observation. The instruction states, \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" A better caption would describe their visible poses factually (e.g., \"They are standing in various orientations within a dense formation\").\n*   **Redundancy:** The final sentence, \"The scene captures the collective presence of the horses, emphasizing their numbers and diversity in color,\" is redundant. It summarizes what has already been stated in the first two sentences, which goes against the goal of being concise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it is too generic and violates key instructions. While it gets the format and basic subject identification right, it fails to provide the level of specific, factual detail required. It also includes an unnecessary interpretive phrase and a redundant final sentence. A better caption would eliminate the summary, replace the inference with a factual description of their poses, and add more specific visual details about the horses' appearances.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A large group of horses is gathered closely together, displaying a variety of colors, including shades of brown, black, and white. Some horses have distinctive markings, such as patches and blazes on their faces. Their manes and tails vary in color and length, adding to the visual diversity. The horses stand in various orientations within the dense formation, with some facing forward and others seen in profile. Their collective presence highlights their numbers and the diversity in their appearances.",
