    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling urban scene at night, with several people walking on a tiled pedestrian walkway. The individuals are dressed in dark, formal clothing, likely suits, and some are carrying bags. A few people are wearing face masks. The setting is surrounded by tall, illuminated buildings with prominent signage, contributing to a vibrant city atmosphere. The people are dispersed across the walkway, moving in various directions, suggesting a typical evening in a busy city area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the general setting as a bustling urban night scene with pedestrians, but it lacks specificity and contains inaccuracies. It fails to prioritize the main subject, a woman in the foreground who is more in focus than the surrounding crowd. She is wearing a dark trench coat over a dress and carrying a distinctive red handbag, key details that are missed entirely. The description inaccurately generalizes that all individuals are in \"dark, formal clothing,\" whereas the crowd actually displays a mix of attire, including some men in suits but also others in casual puffer jackets and jeans. Furthermore, the absolute claim that \"all are wearing face masks\" is incorrect; a few people in the mid-ground have their masks pulled down, making \"most individuals\" a more accurate descriptor. The mention of bags is too vague; specifying the main woman's red handbag, a man pulling a small rolling suitcase, and another person with a backpack would provide more concrete visual information. Lastly, the caption uses the subjective phrase \"vibrant city atmosphere\" and misses the opportunity to describe the specific nature of the \"prominent signage,\" which consists of bright, multi-colored neon signs with Japanese characters, a crucial detail for identifying the location and style of the cityscape.",
