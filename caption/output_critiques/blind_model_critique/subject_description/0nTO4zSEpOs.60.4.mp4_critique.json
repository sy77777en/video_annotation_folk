    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling urban scene at night, with several people walking on a tiled pedestrian walkway. The individuals are dressed in dark, formal clothing, likely suits, and some are carrying bags. A few people are wearing face masks. The setting is surrounded by tall, illuminated buildings with prominent signage, contributing to a vibrant city atmosphere. The people are dispersed across the walkway, moving in various directions, suggesting a typical evening in a busy city area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it successfully captures the general essence of the scene, it fails to adhere to several critical negative constraints and guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of people in dark clothing, some with bags and masks, on a tiled walkway at night surrounded by illuminated buildings is plausible and internally consistent.\n*   **Inaccuracy/Speculation:** The phrase \"**likely suits**\" violates the rule: \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption should only describe the observable \"dark, formal clothing\" without inferring the specific garment type.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Partially Complete:** The caption identifies the main subjects (\"several people\") and provides some group attributes (clothing, bags, masks). This aligns with the instruction to describe subjects as a group if there is no clear focus.\n*   **Lacks Detail:** The instructions ask for key visual attributes like gender, hairstyle, and skin tone \"if discernible.\" The caption remains very general. If any individuals were clear enough to be described with more specificity (e.g., \"a man in a dark coat,\" \"a woman with long hair\"), that detail is missing. It treats the group as a homogenous whole, which might be an oversimplification.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"**bustling**,\" \"**vibrant**,\" and \"**typical**,\" all of which are subjective and interpretative rather than objective and descriptive.\n*   **Violation of \"Don't Mention the Background\":** The instruction is clear: \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" A large part of the caption is dedicated to the background: \"The setting is surrounded by tall, illuminated buildings with prominent signage.\" This description does not help distinguish the people from one another and should have been omitted.\n*   **Violation of \"No Interpretation\":** The caption includes phrases like \"**contributing to a vibrant city atmosphere**\" and \"**suggesting a typical evening in a busy city area**.\" These are interpretations of the scene's mood and context, not a direct, factual description of visual elements as required.\n*   **Violation of \"Concise Focus on Subjects\":** By dedicating significant space to the background and atmosphere, the caption loses its concise focus on the subjects (the people), which the instructions mandate as the primary goal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a good general description for a casual audience, but it is a poor execution of the specific, technical instructions provided. It fails on multiple core rules, particularly the prohibitions against subjective language, background description, and interpretation. A good caption, according to the rules, would have focused exclusively on the observable, objective details of the people in the scene.",
