    "pre_caption": "A man with light skin and voluminous, curly, shoulder-length blonde hair is dancing with a woman who has light skin and long, straight blonde hair. The man wears a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a dark bow tie and has a white flower pinned to his lapel. The woman is dressed in a light-colored, sleeveless garment and wears a corsage of pinkish flowers on her wrist. They are holding hands and have their arms around each other as they dance closely, looking into each other's eyes and leaning in to kiss.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation by identifying the two main subjects and their core interaction, but it misses several key visual details and misrepresents the flow of the action. The description of the clothing could be more specific; the man's \"dark suit jacket\" is a classic black tuxedo jacket, and the woman's \"light-colored, off-shoulder garment\" is clearly a white wedding gown with intricate lace detailing on the bodice. The description of the action is incomplete, as the video doesn't just show them \"leaning in to kiss\" but captures the full moment where they share a gentle, lingering kiss and then pull back slightly, both breaking into wide, genuine smiles. Furthermore, the hair descriptions are not entirely accurate; the man's hair is more wavy than \"voluminous, curly,\" and the woman's \"long, straight blonde hair\" is actually styled in an elegant low chignon, with only a few soft tendrils framing her face. Lastly, the caption omits the woman's other visible accessories, such as the simple diamond stud earrings and a delicate silver necklace that are clearly visible as they dance.",
