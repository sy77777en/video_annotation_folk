    "pre_caption": "Two stylized, glowing white human figures stand next to each other. They are depicted as featureless silhouettes, lacking any discernible clothing, hair, or facial details, but possessing a clear humanoid form with a head, torso, and limbs. The figure on the left is positioned slightly behind and to the left of the other, while the figure on the right stands slightly forward. Both are in a static standing pose.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes two subjects as \"stylized, glowing white human figures.\" The use of terms like \"featureless silhouettes\" and \"humanoid form\" is an accurate and objective way to describe subjects that lack specific details like faces or clothing. The description of their relative positions (\"figure on the left is positioned slightly behind,\" \"figure on the right stands slightly forward\") is also a precise spatial observation.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It covers all the essential visual information about the subjects:\n*   **Number and Type:** \"Two... human figures.\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** \"stylized,\" \"glowing white,\" \"featureless silhouettes,\" \"humanoid form with a head, torso, and limbs.\"\n*   **Pose and Orientation:** \"stand next to each other,\" \"static standing pose.\"\n*   **Relationship:** It clearly distinguishes the two figures by their left/right positioning and their forward/backward placement.\n\nThere are no missing details that could be added without violating the instructions (e.g., by describing the background or speculating on gender).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the given instructions almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear mental image in a short, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the two figures, correctly ignoring the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"motion.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, non-subjective adjectives (\"glowing,\" \"white,\" \"stylized\") and avoids emotional language.\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subjects as \"human figures,\" which is the most precise and non-speculative term given their featureless nature.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on their form, color, and lack of features.\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively uses location (\"on the left,\" \"on the right\") to differentiate between the two identical subjects.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or markdown.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and objective, creating a clear and concise description of the subjects while adhering strictly to all the rules.",
