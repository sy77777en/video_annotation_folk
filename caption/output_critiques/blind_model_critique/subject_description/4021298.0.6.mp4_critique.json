    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a scene featuring several camels and a group of people in a rocky, mountainous area. The camels are adorned with colorful, decorative tassels and blankets, adding vibrant hues to their natural brown tones. One camel, prominently positioned, has a close-up shot that highlights its face and decorative harness. The people, dressed in varied traditional attire, including headscarves and long garments, are gathered near the camels. One man wears a red jacket, while another is in a dark coat with a patterned headscarf. The setting suggests a cultural or tourist activity, with the camels and people interacting in a natural, outdoor environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption, but it has one significant flaw and a minor area for improvement.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects as \"camels\" and \"a group of people\" and accurately describes their key visual attributes, such as the camels' \"colorful, decorative tassels and blankets\" and the specific clothing of the people (\"red jacket,\" \"dark coat with a patterned headscarf\"). The description of the setting as a \"rocky, mountainous area\" is also precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, covering the most salient subjects and their important features. It successfully combines details from different moments (a wider view and a close-up) into a single, coherent paragraph, giving a good overall sense of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, concise paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It correctly uses precise subject types (\"camels,\" \"man\") and avoids vague terms.\n    *   It provides strong, objective descriptions of visual attributes (colors, clothing, decorations).\n    *   It successfully distinguishes between multiple subjects (e.g., \"One camel, prominently positioned,\" \"One man... another...\").\n    *   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Major Violation:** The final sentence, \"The setting suggests a cultural or tourist activity, with the camels and people interacting in a natural, outdoor environment,\" violates the instruction to **avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.** Stating that the scene \"suggests a cultural or tourist activity\" is an interpretation of the event's purpose, not a direct description of visual facts. The word \"interacting\" is also a bit vague compared to describing specific actions.\n    *   **Minor Violation:** The phrase \"has a close-up shot\" refers to a cinematographic technique rather than just describing the subject. The instruction asks to combine details without referring to specific frames or shots. A better phrasing would be: \"One camel is seen in detail, highlighting its face and decorative harness.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good and follows most of the complex instructions well. Its primary failure is making an inference about the nature of the activity instead of sticking strictly to visual description. Removing the final interpretive sentence would make it almost perfect.",
