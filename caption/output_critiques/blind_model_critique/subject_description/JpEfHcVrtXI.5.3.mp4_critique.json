    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption effectively captures the main subjects and the core action of the scene. However, it could be enhanced by adding more specific visual details that would likely be visible. The description of the small creature is good, but it omits its posture; for instance, it could be described as standing alertly and looking up towards the cyan light, which would add context to its stillness. For the larger creature, describing it simply as \"dark\" and \"bulky\" misses key opportunities for detail. In a dark scene, any source of light, even faint, would be prominent. You could mention if the creature has glowing eyes, perhaps a faint red or yellow, which would be a very salient feature. The action \"picks up\" is too generic and lacks the nuance of the interaction. A more descriptive phrase, such as \"gently scoops up the small creature in one large hand and places it on its shoulder\" or \"swiftly grabs the creature,\" would clarify the nature of their relationship—whether it's protective or aggressive. Finally, while you mention the cyan light outlining the small creature, you could also describe how that light interacts with the larger creature as it runs across the scene, for example, by noting how the swirling light casts a moving highlight across its back and head, further defining its form and motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dark, silhouetted landscape, a small, slender creature with two long, pointed ears stands alertly on a ledge, its posture suggesting attentiveness as it gazes up towards a bright, swirling cyan light in the sky. To the right, a much larger, bulky creature with a rounded, owl-like silhouette is seen in mid-air, as if jumping or floating away. Its form is partially illuminated by the cyan light, which casts a moving highlight across its back and head, revealing faintly glowing red eyes that pierce through the darkness. The larger creature gently scoops up the small creature in one large hand, placing it protectively on its shoulder, suggesting a bond between the two as they move together through the ethereal landscape.",
