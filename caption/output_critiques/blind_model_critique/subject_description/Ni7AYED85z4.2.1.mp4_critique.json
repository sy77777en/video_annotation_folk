    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the ambiance of a European-style public square. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and sense of place rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The camera moves along a cobblestone pavement, passing the enclosed outdoor patio of a restaurant. The patio structure features dark wood framing and large glass windows, through which neatly set dining tables with white tablecloths and wine glasses are visible. In the background, people stroll past a grand, light-colored stone building with prominent columns and steps, while a classic, ornate dark green lamppost stands on the corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **good** but has a few minor areas where it deviates from the instructions. It successfully captures the essence of the video but could be improved for stricter adherence.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key subjects and their visual attributes: the cityscape setting, the cobblestone pavement, the restaurant patio with its dark wood and glass structure, the dining tables with white tablecloths, the background stone building with columns, and the ornate dark green lamppost.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is largely complete, covering the most prominent elements of the scene. However, the description of the \"people\" is minimal (\"people stroll\"). While the instructions allow for brief mentions of secondary subjects, adding a general detail like \"casually dressed people\" would have made it more visually informative without being overly specific.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Clarity and Subject Identification:** It uses precise, clear terms for all subjects (e.g., \"cobblestone pavement,\" \"lamppost,\" \"patio\") and avoids vague language.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and follows the specific instruction to explain *why* there is no main subject (\"the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and sense of place\").\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole, integrating details smoothly rather than listing them frame by frame.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The primary weakness is the use of subjective language. The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"ambiance\" and \"sense of place,\" which describe the feeling or atmosphere of the scene rather than its objective visual characteristics. Words like \"grand\" and \"classic\" are also borderline subjective, though they can be argued as descriptive of scale and style.\n*   **Redundant Opening:** The first two sentences are slightly meta, explaining what the video *is* and *why* it lacks a main subject. While this follows one part of the instruction, it could be integrated more naturally into the description itself for better flow and conciseness. For example, starting with \"A view of a European-style public square moves along a cobblestone pavement...\" would be more direct.",
