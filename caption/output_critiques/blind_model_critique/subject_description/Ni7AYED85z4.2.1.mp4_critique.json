    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the ambiance of a European-style public square. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on establishing the atmosphere and sense of place rather than highlighting a specific person or object. The camera moves along a cobblestone pavement, passing the enclosed outdoor patio of a restaurant. The patio structure features dark wood framing and large glass windows, through which neatly set dining tables with white tablecloths and wine glasses are visible. In the background, people stroll past a grand, light-colored stone building with prominent columns and steps, while a classic, ornate dark green lamppost stands on the corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot and captures several key elements, it misses opportunities to fully convey the \"ambiance\" it mentions. The description of \"people stroll\" is too generic; the video likely shows more specific individuals, such as a woman in a bright red coat walking a small dog or a couple sitting on a bench, whose inclusion would add life and scale to the scene. The caption also fails to describe the quality of the light, a critical component of the atmosphere; for instance, it could have mentioned the warm, golden glow of a late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the cobblestones. Furthermore, the \"grand, light-colored stone building\" could be more vividly detailed by noting its specific architectural features, such as the large arched windows on its ground floor or the statues flanking its main entrance. Finally, the sentence explaining the lack of a main subject feels like an unnecessary meta-commentary; a stronger caption would demonstrate this by weaving all the described elements into a cohesive whole that naturally directs the viewer's attention to the overall environment rather than explicitly stating its purpose.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures the vibrant ambiance of a European-style public square, where the warm, golden glow of the late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the cobblestone pavement. The camera glides past the enclosed outdoor patio of a restaurant, framed in dark wood with large glass windows revealing neatly set dining tables adorned with white tablecloths and wine glasses. A woman in a bright red coat walks a small dog, adding a splash of color and life to the scene, while a couple sits on a nearby bench, enjoying the tranquil atmosphere. In the background, a grand, light-colored stone building stands majestically, featuring large arched windows on its ground floor and statues flanking its main entrance. A classic, ornate dark green lamppost graces the corner, completing the picturesque setting.",
