    "pre_caption": "A middle-aged, light-skinned woman with shoulder-length brown hair stands on a red carpet on a stage. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, knee-length dress and tall black boots. Positioned in profile, she faces towards the right side of the scene. She holds a small, dark object, likely a presentation remote, in her hands, appearing to be in the process of giving a speech.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the provided instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a middle-aged, light-skinned woman and accurately describes her hair, clothing (dark gray sleeveless dress, tall black boots), and pose (standing in profile, facing right). The description of her location on a red carpet on a stage is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the key visual attributes of the subject as required by the instructions, including her estimated age, skin tone, hairstyle, clothing style and color, footwear, pose, and orientation within the scene. It also notes the object she is holding.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:** The caption adheres to the instructions very well, but with one minor deviation.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the salient subject and her key visual attributes.\n    *   It correctly uses a precise subject type (\"woman\").\n    *   It avoids subjective adjectives, meta-terms like \"image\" or \"frame,\" and unnecessary details about the background.\n    *   It correctly describes her pose and location to provide context for her action.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The phrase \"**likely a presentation remote**\" is a form of speculation. While it is a reasonable guess, it is not a confirmed fact from the visual evidence. A more compliant description would have been to simply describe the object's appearance, such as \"a small, dark object.\" Similarly, \"**appearing to be in the process of giving a speech**\" is an inference about her action. While it's a strong and useful inference, the speculation about the remote is a clearer violation of the rule against describing what you are unsure about.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent—it is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the vast majority of the rules. The only point of critique is the minor speculation about the identity of the object she is holding, which slightly deviates from the strict instruction to avoid describing things one is unsure about.",
