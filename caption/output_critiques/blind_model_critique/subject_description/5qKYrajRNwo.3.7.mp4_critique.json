    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit, cluttered room, a young girl, depicted as a stop-motion puppet, sits in the foreground. She has dark skin, and her black hair is styled in two braids. Her most prominent and atypical feature is her eyes, which are large, round, and completely dark, appearing as hollow sockets without pupils or irises. She wears a simple, sleeveless, off-white dress and is seated cross-legged on the floor, holding an open book. In the background, another puppet figure of a woman is seated. This woman also has dark skin and the same large, hollow, dark eyes. She wears a reddish-brown top and is engaged in an activity with her hands.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two main subjects as stop-motion puppets and notes their key features, it describes the scene as if it were a static photograph rather than a dynamic video. It misses the core stop-motion action; for example, the video shows the young girl slowly turning a page of her book, her head tilting slightly as she reads, not just holding it open. The description of the woman in the background is too vague with \"engaged in an activity with her hands\"; in the video, she is clearly knitting, her hands methodically working with dark blue yarn and wooden needles. The caption also omits important textural details, failing to mention that the puppets are made of a soft, felt-like material, and that their \"atypical\" eyes are glossy, black beads that reflect the dim light. Lastly, the description doesn't capture the subtle narrative created by the camera's movement, which slowly pushes in on the girl before briefly racking focus to the knitting woman, establishing a quiet, shared space between the two characters.",
