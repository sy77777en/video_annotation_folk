    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot of a street in Japan on a bright, sunny day. The focus is on the overall urban environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject, capturing a sense of place and time. A modern, grey, arched entrance to the Gojo subway station stands prominently on the sidewalk, with its signage clearly visible. Pedestrians and a cyclist move along the pavement, which is lined with a mix of multi-story buildings. In the background, traffic flows down the street, and green mountains are visible in the distance under a clear blue sky, completing the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a daytime cityscape scene in Japan. It correctly identifies the key elements: the Gojo subway station entrance, pedestrians, a cyclist, multi-story buildings, street traffic, and distant green mountains under a blue sky. The description of the station entrance as \"modern, grey, arched\" is specific and precise.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, capturing the entire scope of the scene from the prominent foreground object (the subway station) to the moving elements (people, traffic) and the distant background (mountains). It successfully paints a full picture of the urban landscape.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and follows the specific instruction for this type of content. It explicitly states, \"The focus is on the overall urban environment and atmosphere rather than a specific subject,\" which is exactly what the rules require.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The paragraph is well-structured, concise, and easy to understand. It delivers all the necessary information without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"cityscape,\" \"subway station,\" \"pedestrians,\" and \"cyclist.\" It correctly treats the people as part of the general scenery rather than as main subjects requiring detailed descriptions, which is appropriate for a wide environmental shot.\n    *   **Objective Language:** The description uses objective, descriptive language (\"grey, arched,\" \"green mountains,\" \"clear blue sky\") and avoids subjective, emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, clean paragraph with no introductory text or markdown, as instructed.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" within the description itself (the introductory phrase \"This video presents\" is acceptable as it frames the description, but the core description is clean).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It correctly analyzes the video's content, applies the appropriate rule for a scenery shot, and constructs a description that is accurate, complete, and stylistically perfect.",
