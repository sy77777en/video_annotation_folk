    "pre_caption": "The video features a person, two camels, and a car. The person, dressed in dark blue or black clothing that covers their body and head, is sitting on the sand. Next to them, one light-brown camel stands with a dark pack on its back, while a second camel lies on the ground. A blue car speeds across the sand dunes, kicking up a large cloud of dust. The focus then shifts to a close-up, slow-motion view of the sand and small, dark pieces of debris being thrown into the air, flying directly toward the viewer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video takes place in a desert surrounding. In the beginning, the camera moves closer to two camels and a person, then quickly passes over them, revealing a car speeding through the desert, kicking up a large amount of sand. The camera then approaches the flying sand, transitioning into a slow-motion shot of sand and debris flying toward the camera, creating a powerful scene.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good sequential overview, but it lacks integration and specificity, making the scenes feel disconnected. The relationship between the person with the camels and the speeding car is unclear; the caption describes them as separate events rather than elements within a single, cohesive scene. For instance, the car could be driving in the background behind the person, creating a dynamic contrast, which the caption fails to mention. The description of the person is vague; specifying a gender, such as \"a man,\" and a more precise clothing type, like \"a dark blue thawb and a matching ghutra,\" would be more informative. Similarly, the \"blue car\" could be more descriptively identified as a \"blue 4x4 SUV\" or \"dune buggy.\" The second camel is described as lying down, but its color and whether it also has a pack are omitted. The transition is described as \"the focus then shifts,\" which is ambiguous; a \"hard cut\" is a more precise term if it's an abrupt scene change. Finally, the \"small, dark pieces of debris\" in the slow-motion shot could be more vividly described as \"coarse grains of sand and small pebbles,\" and specifying that this spray originates from the car's spinning tire would connect the final shot back to the preceding action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a cohesive scene in a desert setting, featuring a man dressed in a dark blue thawb and a matching ghutra, sitting on the sand beside two camels. One camel, light-brown with a dark pack on its back, stands alert, while the other, a darker shade, lies on the ground without a pack. In the background, a blue 4x4 SUV speeds across the sand dunes, creating a dynamic contrast as it kicks up a large cloud of dust. The scene transitions with a hard cut to a close-up, slow-motion view of coarse grains of sand and small pebbles being flung into the air by the SUV's spinning tire, flying directly toward the viewer.",
