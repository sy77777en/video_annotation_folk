    "pre_caption": "Several people are seen from behind, seated in red theater chairs and facing a stage. One man has short, graying hair and wears a dark suit jacket. A young man with fair skin, dark curly hair, and a mustache, dressed in a black turtleneck and a matching jacket, walks onto the stage. He stands behind a small table and holds a golden-colored statuette with an abstract design. As the audience members, whose hands are briefly visible, applaud, the young man smiles slightly before walking away with his award.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video depicts an award event. Several people are seated facing the stage, with their upper backs visible as they move out of frame while the camera trucks to the right. The award winner enters the frame, showing his upper torso, and then exits the scene.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a clear sequence of events, but it could be improved by adding more specific visual context that would likely be present in the video. For instance, the description of the stage is minimal; the video probably shows more than just a \"small table,\" such as a podium, microphone, or a large screen in the background, which would help establish the setting as a formal ceremony. The action of the young man picking up an award that is \"already on the table\" is unusual and lacks context; the video might show another person placing it there or it might be a specific type of event where this is standard, which the caption could clarify to avoid ambiguity. The description of the audience as \"several people\" might underrepresent the scale if the video shows a large, filled auditorium. Furthermore, the caption ends abruptly with the man walking away; it's highly probable the video shows what he does next, such as approaching a microphone to speak, which is a significant part of the action. The description of his \"slight smile\" is also vague; the video would reveal a more specific expression, such as an appreciative, proud, or relieved smile, which would add more depth. Lastly, the caption reads like a single, continuous shot, whereas a production of this type would almost certainly involve cuts between different angles, like a wide shot of the stage, a close-up on the statuette, and a reaction shot of the man's face, which are important visual details to include.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera captures a large, filled auditorium with rows of red theater chairs, where the audience is seated, facing a well-lit stage. On the stage, a podium with a microphone stands beside a large screen displaying event graphics, setting the scene for a formal award ceremony. A young man with fair skin, dark curly hair, and a mustache, dressed in a black turtleneck and matching jacket, walks onto the stage. He approaches a small table where a golden-colored statuette with an abstract design has been placed, possibly by a previous presenter. As he picks up the award, the camera cuts to a close-up of his face, revealing a proud and appreciative smile. The audience applauds, their hands visible in the foreground. The young man then steps towards the microphone, preparing to give a speech, as the camera shifts to a wide shot of the stage, capturing the grandeur of the event.",
