    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a dynamic pose, wearing a black and white striped sports jersey with the number 18. He has short, dark hair and a determined expression. His eyes are glowing red, and red, vein-like energy surrounds him, emphasizing his intense focus and power. The man appears to be in motion, possibly running or charging forward, with his fists clenched and arms bent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially successful but has several significant flaws in its adherence to the instructions. While it correctly identifies the subject and some of his visual attributes, it violates key negative constraints, particularly regarding subjectivity and interpretation.\n\n### Accuracy & Completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the man's appearance (striped jersey with number 18, short dark hair, glowing red eyes, red energy) is specific and appears to be accurate based on the description.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption provides a good overview of the subject's key features, clothing, and pose. It successfully synthesizes these details into a single description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the caption succeeds and fails based on the specific rules:\n\n*   **Successes:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a reasonable length and provides key information.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subject as a \"man\" and describes his visual attributes.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single paragraph without Markdown or introductory text (other than the phrase \"The video features...\").\n    *   **No Forbidden Words:** It avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Failures:**\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** The caption uses the phrases **\"determined expression\"** and **\"intense focus.\"** These are interpretations of the man's internal state or emotion, not objective descriptions of his facial features (e.g., \"eyebrows lowered,\" \"mouth set in a firm line\").\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible\":** The caption states that the energy emphasizes his **\"power.\"** Power is an abstract concept, not a visible attribute. The instruction is to describe the visual elements themselves (the red energy), not what they symbolize or imply.\n    *   **Violation of \"Avoid describing what you are unsure about\":** The caption uses the word **\"possibly\"** (\"possibly running or charging forward\"). This is speculative. The instructions require describing only what is certain. A better approach would be to describe the pose objectively (e.g., \"He is in a forward-leaning pose with his arms bent and fists clenched\").\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**The caption is not good because it fails to follow several critical instructions.** It mixes objective description with subjective interpretation, emotional adjectives, and speculation, all of which are explicitly forbidden by the rules. A good caption, according to the provided instructions, would stick strictly to describing the visible facts without interpreting their meaning or the subject's emotional state.\n\n**Improved Example (Following all instructions):**\nA man with short, dark hair is shown in a forward-leaning pose. He wears a black and white striped sports jersey with the number 18 on it. His eyes glow red, and red, vein-like lines of energy emanate from his body. His arms are bent with his fists clenched.",
