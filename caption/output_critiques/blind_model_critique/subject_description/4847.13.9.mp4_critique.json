    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a man wearing a dark suit and a tall black top hat, who is seated at a table, initially looking down at a large, light-colored map spread before him, and then turns his head to look towards an older man. This older man, also in a dark suit and with light-colored hair, stands to the right of the table, facing the seated man and gesturing with his right hand as if speaking. In the background, two other men in dark suits are present; one stands at a counter to the left, initially with his back to the viewer before turning slightly, and another, wearing what appears to be a cap, stands at a counter further to the right, mostly facing away.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It adheres to the instructions with a high degree of accuracy and quality.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is very accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the number of subjects (four men), their key visual attributes (dark suits, a top hat, a cap, light-colored hair), their relative positions (seated at a table, standing to the right, in the background), and the central object of interest (a large, light-colored map). The description of the actions—one man looking down then turning, another gesturing—accurately captures the dynamic nature of the interaction.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive. It successfully identifies and describes all the subjects present, from the main interacting pair to the secondary figures in the background. It includes not only their appearance but also their posture, orientation, and actions over the course of the video. By mentioning the map, it includes the key object that establishes the context for the main subjects' interaction.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The paragraph is a single, coherent block of text that is dense with information but remains easy to read and understand. It avoids unnecessary words while providing a full picture.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It masterfully describes the progression of action (\"initially looking down... and then turns his head\") without breaking the rule of not referring to specific frames.\n*   **Subject Identification and Differentiation:** It uses the precise term \"man\" and effectively distinguishes between the four subjects using clear descriptors like \"the main subject... wearing a... top hat,\" \"This older man,\" and the two men \"in the background,\" further separated by their location and actions.\n*   **Visual Attributes and Objectivity:** The description uses specific, objective language (e.g., \"dark suit,\" \"tall black top hat,\" \"gesturing with his right hand\") and avoids subjective emotional adjectives. It also correctly handles uncertainty with the phrase \"what appears to be a cap.\"\n*   **Structure and Focus:** The caption correctly prioritizes the most salient subjects—the two men at the table—describing them in detail first. It then appropriately gives a less detailed description of the secondary figures in the background, perfectly following the instructions for handling scenes with a clear focus.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, well-structured, and written in clear, objective language.",
