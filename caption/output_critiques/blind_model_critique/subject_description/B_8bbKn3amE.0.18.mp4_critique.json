    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial scenery shot that plunges the viewer through the dramatic landscape of a massive glacier. The camera navigates at high speed through a deep, narrow crevasse, flanked by towering walls of jagged, fractured ice and compacted snow. The ice within the chasm reveals a pale blue tint, contrasting with the bright white snow on the upper surfaces and the dark, rocky mountain face that borders the glacier under an overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is entirely on conveying the immense scale, raw texture, and imposing atmosphere of the glacial environment. The rapid movement and close proximity to the ice formations emphasize the vastness and intricate details of the natural wonder rather than a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the general essence of the video, correctly identifying it as a high-speed aerial tour of a glacial crevasse. However, it understates some of the most striking visual details. The description of the ice as having a \"pale blue tint\" doesn't do justice to the vibrant, deep sapphire and aquamarine hues that glow from within the densest parts of the glacier, which are a central feature of the footage. The caption also misses the textural contrast between the sharp, crystalline \"fractured ice\" and the softer, wind-sculpted layers of snow that cling to the upper ledges. Furthermore, while the camera movement is noted as \"high speed,\" the description could be more dynamic by mentioning how the camera banks and weaves through the serpentine canyon, closely hugging the ice walls to enhance the sense of velocity and danger. Finally, the \"dark, rocky mountain face\" is more specifically a sheer wall of dark grey slate, and the \"overcast sky\" creates a diffuse, ethereal light that filters into the chasm, making the blue ice seem to glow and casting shifting, soft shadows that add to the scene's depth and moody atmosphere.",
