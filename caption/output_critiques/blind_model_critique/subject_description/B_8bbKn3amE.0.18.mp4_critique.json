    "pre_caption": "This is an aerial scenery shot that plunges the viewer through the dramatic landscape of a massive glacier. The camera navigates at high speed through a deep, narrow crevasse, flanked by towering walls of jagged, fractured ice and compacted snow. The ice within the chasm reveals a pale blue tint, contrasting with the bright white snow on the upper surfaces and the dark, rocky mountain face that borders the glacier under an overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is entirely on conveying the immense scale, raw texture, and imposing atmosphere of the glacial environment. The rapid movement and close proximity to the ice formations emphasize the vastness and intricate details of the natural wonder rather than a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the video as an aerial shot of a glacier, specifically moving through a crevasse. The descriptions of the visual elements—jagged ice, compacted snow, the pale blue tint within the chasm, the white snow on top, and the bordering rocky mountain under an overcast sky—are all factually correct and align with what is typically seen in such videos.\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully captures the essence of the video, including the sense of motion, the textures of the ice and snow, and the overall scale of the environment. It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows most instructions well, but it fails on one key point.\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is clear, informative, and written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole, without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly follows the specific rule for scenery shots. It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot, states there is no main subject, and dedicates the final two sentences to explaining *why* the focus is on the environment, scale, and atmosphere rather than a single subject.\n    *   **Necessary Motion:** It includes the high-speed motion, which is justified as it is the defining action and experience of the video, not just incidental background movement.\n\n*   **Where it fails:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The most significant error is the violation of the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses several subjective and emotive words:\n        *   \"**dramatic** landscape\"\n        *   \"**imposing** atmosphere\"\n        *   \"natural **wonder**\"\n        These words interpret the scene and assign emotional weight, which the instructions explicitly forbid. Words like \"massive\" and \"towering\" are borderline but are more descriptive of scale than emotion; however, \"dramatic\" and \"imposing\" are purely subjective.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**.\n\nIts primary strength is its excellent structure and its adherence to the specific, complex instruction for describing a scenery shot without a main subject. It accurately and completely describes the visual content. However, its failure to remain objective by using emotive, subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"imposing,\" and \"wonder\" is a clear violation of a core instruction. To be considered a great caption, it would need to remove this subjective language and describe the scene in purely objective, descriptive terms.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is an aerial scenery shot that takes the viewer through the expansive landscape of a large glacier.
