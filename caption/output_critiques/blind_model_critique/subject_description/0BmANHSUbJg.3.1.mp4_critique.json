    "pre_caption": "The video features a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned prominently in the foreground. The aircraft is partially engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing. The explosion creates a dramatic contrast against the night setting, with the flames illuminating the scene. In the background, a hangar with bright lights is visible, providing a stark contrast to the dark sky. The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central subject as an exploding passenger airplane, it could be improved by adhering more strictly to the instructions. The description uses subjective and interpretive language such as \"dramatic contrast,\" \"intensity,\" and \"dramatic impact,\" which should be replaced with purely objective visual facts, allowing the visuals to speak for themselves. The final sentence is redundant, summarizing previously stated information, and should be removed for conciseness. The description of the airplane is somewhat generic; it could be enhanced by specifying which wing is on fire (e.g., the right wing, near the engine), mentioning any visible airline logos or tail fin colors that might be illuminated by the flames, and providing a more specific aircraft type if possible (e.g., \"a wide-body, four-engine airplane\"). Furthermore, the caption describes a static scene, but a video would show progression; it could better capture this by describing the explosion as it erupts and the flames and smoke as they grow and billow over time, or by noting if debris is seen falling from the wing. Lastly, while the hangar is mentioned, adding a detail like \"the hangar's large bay doors are open, revealing the interior structure\" could provide more context without shifting the focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, prominently positioned in the foreground. The right wing, near the engine, is engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke billowing and growing over time. Debris can be seen falling from the wing as the explosion progresses. The night setting is illuminated by the flames, and the tail fin, partially visible, displays a logo. In the background, a hangar with bright lights and large open bay doors reveals the interior structure, contrasting with the dark sky.",
