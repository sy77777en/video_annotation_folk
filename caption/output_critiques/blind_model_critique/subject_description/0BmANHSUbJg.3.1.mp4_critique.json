    "pre_caption": "The video features a large passenger airplane with a white fuselage and visible windows, positioned prominently in the foreground. The aircraft is partially engulfed in a fiery explosion, with bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing. The explosion creates a dramatic contrast against the night setting, with the flames illuminating the scene. In the background, a hangar with bright lights is visible, providing a stark contrast to the dark sky. The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but has several areas for improvement based on the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"large passenger airplane\" and accurately describes its key visual attributes (\"white fuselage,\" \"visible windows\"). It also precisely describes the event: a \"fiery explosion\" with \"bright orange flames and thick black smoke emanating from its wing.\" The description of the background (\"hangar with bright lights,\" \"dark sky\") is also correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures the most salient subject (the airplane), the primary action (the explosion), and the relevant context (the night setting and the hangar). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some significant flaws.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a good amount of detail in a relatively short paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"passenger airplane\" and \"hangar.\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It effectively describes colors, shapes, and states (e.g., \"white fuselage,\" \"bright orange flames,\" \"thick black smoke\").\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that prioritizes the main subject first.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n*   **Referring to the Medium:** The instruction states to avoid terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and to describe the content directly. The caption violates this by starting with \"**The video features...**\" and later using the phrase \"**The sequence captures...**\". A better approach would be to start the description directly, for example: \"A large passenger airplane with a white fuselage...\"\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"**dramatic** contrast,\" \"the **intensity** of the explosion,\" and \"**dramatic** impact.\" These words interpret the scene's emotional weight rather than just describing its visual facts. More neutral alternatives would be \"high contrast\" or simply describing the size and brightness of the explosion.\n*   **Redundancy:** The final sentence, \"The sequence captures the intensity of the explosion and the subsequent smoke, highlighting the dramatic impact on the airplane,\" is redundant. It summarizes what has already been described in the preceding sentences and adds subjective commentary, violating the rules on conciseness and objectivity. Removing this sentence would make the caption stronger and more compliant.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately and completely describes the visual content, it fails to adhere to key negative constraints in the instructions, specifically by referring to the video medium, using subjective language, and including a redundant final sentence.",
