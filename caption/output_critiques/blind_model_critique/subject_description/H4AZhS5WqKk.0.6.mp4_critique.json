    "pre_caption": "The video features two cartoon-style animated cats in a confrontational scene. On the left, the head of a large, gray-blue cat is shown in a close-up. This cat has a white muzzle, long black whiskers, a black nose, and large yellow eyes; its expression changes from surprised to angry. Facing it on the right is a smaller, full-bodied red cat styled as a devil. This red cat has a lighter red belly and muzzle, small horns, a pointed tail, and a small black cape. It stands on a white, cloud-like object while holding a red trident and gesturing toward the larger cat with a taunting expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. The gray-blue character on the left is shown in a close-up of its head, while the red character on the right is shown in full body.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is effective, evaluating its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the specific rules.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"two cartoon-style animated cats\" and accurately describes their visual attributes. Details like the \"gray-blue\" color of the large cat, its \"white muzzle\" and \"yellow eyes,\" and the \"devil\" styling of the red cat (complete with \"horns,\" \"pointed tail,\" \"black cape,\" and \"red trident\") are precise and true to the visual information. The description of the scene as \"confrontational\" is an accurate interpretation based on the characters' expressions and actions.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential information needed to understand the scene.\n*   **Subjects:** It identifies and describes both primary subjects in detail.\n*   **Attributes:** It includes color, size, key features (whiskers, horns), clothing/accessories (cape), and held objects (trident).\n*   **Context:** It describes their relative positions (\"On the left,\" \"Facing it on the right\"), poses (\"head... in a close-up,\" \"stands on a white, cloud-like object\"), and interactions (\"gesturing toward the larger cat\").\n*   **Dynamics:** It successfully captures the dynamic nature of the video by noting that the gray-blue cat's \"expression changes from surprised to angry,\" which is a crucial detail that a static description would miss.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided instructions meticulously.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is packed with information but remains a single, coherent, and easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the two cats, their attributes, and their interaction, correctly ignoring the non-essential background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes information from the entire video (e.g., the changing expression) rather than describing a single moment.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear and straightforward.\n*   **Objective Language:** This is a key point. The instruction says to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" However, it also requires describing \"facial expression.\" The caption uses \"surprised,\" \"angry,\" and \"taunting expression.\" In the context of animation, these are not subjective interpretations but rather objective descriptions of the clearly depicted visual cues (e.g., wide eyes for surprise, furrowed brows for anger). The caption correctly describes the *portrayed* expression, which is a visual attribute, adhering to the spirit of the rule.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses the precise term \"cats\" and distinguishes them effectively by their appearance (\"large, gray-blue cat,\" \"smaller, full-bodied red cat\") and location.\n*   **Detailed Attributes and Pose:** The description of colors, features, and poses (\"stands on,\" \"holding,\" \"gesturing\") is exemplary.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of all the rules, including the nuances of describing depicted emotions as objective visual attributes.",
