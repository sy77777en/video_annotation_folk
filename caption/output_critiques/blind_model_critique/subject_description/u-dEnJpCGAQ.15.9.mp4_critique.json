    "pre_caption": "Two adult lionesses with tawny, light brown fur and muscular builds walk forward, accompanied by at least three small lion cubs. The lioness on the right is slightly ahead of the one on the left, and both have alert expressions with their mouths slightly open. The cubs, which share the same tawny fur color as the adults, follow closely. One cub walks prominently near the front, to the right of the lead lioness, while two other cubs are visible further behind, walking and playing near the second lioness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the scene, but it could be more evocative and precise in its descriptions. The final sentence, describing the initial two cubs, is slightly awkward and could be restructured for better clarity. While the caption mentions a cub climbing on a lioness's back, it doesn't capture the likely playful and clumsy nature of the attempt; phrasing it as \"playfully attempts to clamber onto\" would be more descriptive. The description of the cubs is also minimal. It's highly probable they have faint spots or rosettes on their tawny fur, a key visual characteristic of young cubs that distinguishes them from the adults, which is a missed detail. Additionally, their behavior is likely more chaotic and energetic than simply \"following closely\"—describing them as tumbling, pouncing, or weaving between the lionesses' legs would paint a more vivid picture. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe *how* the two additional cubs join the group; for example, they might be seen emerging from tall, dry grass on the side of the path before running to catch up, which would add more context and visual interest to their appearance.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two adult lionesses with tawny, light brown fur and muscular builds stride forward, their alert expressions and slightly open mouths suggesting vigilance. Accompanying them are at least three small lion cubs, their tawny coats adorned with faint spots or rosettes, a charming hallmark of their youth. The cubs exhibit a lively energy, tumbling and weaving between the lionesses' legs. One cub, playfully attempting to clamber onto the back of the lead lioness, adds a touch of whimsy to the scene. Meanwhile, two other cubs emerge from the tall, dry grass on the side of the path, their playful antics evident as they pounce and dart to catch up with the group, adding a dynamic and engaging element to the unfolding scene.",
