    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective inside a wooden fire lookout tower, a vast, mountainous landscape is visible at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden-yellow light, with layers of silhouetted mountains and dark coniferous trees seen from a wooden balcony with a railing. On an interior wall, an orange sign with the word \"PARADISE\" in black letters hangs above a small, square picture of a raccoon.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Overall, the caption is very good and largely successful in following the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and well-structured. However, there are a few minor points where it deviates from the provided rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the setting as a first-person perspective from a wooden fire lookout tower.\n*   It accurately describes the landscape (\"mountainous,\" \"silhouetted mountains,\" \"dark coniferous trees\") and the lighting (\"warm, golden-yellow light,\" \"sunrise or sunset\").\n*   All specific objects are described with correct details: the orange \"PARADISE\" sign with black letters, the red and white \"VOLUNTEER\" poster with its emblem, the orange supply box, and the light blue banner with the exact text \"#48 Firewatch | 2016\".\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete.\n*   It captures both the expansive background scenery and the detailed foreground/interior objects.\n*   It doesn't miss any of the salient subjects visible in the scene, providing a comprehensive overview of what the video contains.\n*   The level of detail for each object is excellent, fulfilling the instruction to describe key visual attributes.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption is mostly successful, but with a few minor violations.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **No Speculation:** It correctly handles the ambiguity of the time of day by stating \"at either sunrise or sunset.\"\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, easy to read, and flows well.\n*   **Subject Prioritization:** It logically starts with the most dominant visual element (the landscape) before moving to the smaller, interior details.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing the color, text, and shape of the various signs, posters, and objects.\n*   **Describes the Scene as a Whole:** It synthesizes the static scene into one description without referring to specific moments.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to the instructions:**\n\n1.  **Use of a Forbidden Term:** The instruction states, \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption uses the word **\"picture\"** (\"a small, square picture of a raccoon\"). This is a direct violation of the rule. A better phrasing would have been \"a small, square depiction of a raccoon\" or \"a small, square illustration of a raccoon.\"\n\n2.  **Use of a Subjective Adjective:** The instruction says to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the word **\"vast\"** to describe the landscape. While \"vast\" is descriptive of scale, it can be interpreted as subjective. A more objective description might be \"an expansive mountainous landscape.\" This is a minor infraction, as the word is used to describe a physical quality rather than an emotional one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy and completeness. Its primary failure is the use of the forbidden word \"picture.\" If that single word were changed, and the minor subjective adjective \"vast\" were replaced, the caption would be a near-perfect execution of the given instructions.",
