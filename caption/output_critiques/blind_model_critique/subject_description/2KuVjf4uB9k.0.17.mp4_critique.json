    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but has some significant flaws regarding adherence to the instructions. While it successfully captures the essence of the video, it violates key negative constraints, particularly the rule against subjective and interpretive language.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the presumed visual content. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"red sports car\" and accurately describes its key attributes (\"decals,\" \"spoiler\"), its action (\"drifting\"), the result of that action (\"thick cloud of white smoke from its tires\"), and the setting (\"winding desert road,\" \"arid, sandy terrain\").\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive. It provides a clear and detailed picture of the scene, focusing on the most salient subject and its interaction with the environment. It gives enough information about the car's appearance, its dynamic movement, and the surrounding landscape for a reader to visualize the video effectively.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is mostly clear and focuses on the primary subject.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses a precise term, \"red sports car,\" to identify the subject.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It effectively describes the car's visual attributes (red, sleek, decals, spoiler) and the environment.\n*   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Use of Motion/Background:** It correctly includes motion (\"drifting,\" \"maneuvers\") and background (\"desert road\") as they are essential to describing the subject's action and location.\n\n**Weaknesses (Where the caption fails to follow instructions):**\n*   **Violation of Objectivity:** The most significant failure is the inclusion of subjective and interpretive language. The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to avoid describing what is not visible.\n    *   **\"enhancing the sense of speed and agility\"**: This phrase describes the *effect* on the viewer, not a visual fact. It is an interpretation of the action.\n    *   **\"emphasizing the action and skill involved in the driving\"**: This is highly interpretive. \"Skill\" is an abstract concept inferred from the action, not a visible attribute. This directly violates the rule to describe only what is visible.\n*   **Redundancy and Analysis:** The final sentence (\"The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail are central to the scene, emphasizing the action and skill involved in the driving\") is more of an analysis of the video's composition and theme rather than a direct description of its contents. The instruction is to describe, not to analyze.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It excels at providing an accurate and visually rich description but fails to adhere strictly to the negative constraint against subjectivity and interpretation. To be fully compliant, the last two sentences should be removed or rewritten to be purely descriptive.\n\n**Example of a more compliant version:**\n\"A red, sleek sports car with a spoiler and decals drifts on a winding desert road. As it maneuvers through the curves at high speed, its tires emit a thick cloud of white smoke that trails behind it. The surrounding landscape consists of arid, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation.\"",
