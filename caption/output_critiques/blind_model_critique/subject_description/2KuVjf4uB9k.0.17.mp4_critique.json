    "pre_caption": "The video features a red sports car prominently drifting on a winding desert road. The car is sleek and aerodynamic, with visible decals and a spoiler on the back. It emits a thick cloud of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed motion and sharp turns. The road is surrounded by arid, sandy terrain with sparse vegetation, enhancing the sense of speed and agility as the car maneuvers through the curves. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail are central to the scene, emphasizing the action and skill involved in the driving.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the core action, it misses several key visual details that would likely be present in such a video. The most significant omission is the driver, who is a central subject performing the action. A more complete description would mention the driver, perhaps a man wearing a helmet and a racing suit, visible through the car's window gripping the steering wheel. The description of the car as having \"visible decals\" is too vague; it would be more informative to specify their nature, such as white racing numbers on the doors or sponsor logos on the hood and fenders. The caption also treats the video as a single, continuous scene, whereas a dynamic video like this would likely feature multiple camera angles and cuts—for instance, a transition from a wide, sweeping drone shot showing the car against the vast desert to a low-angle, close-up shot tracking the spinning tires as they emit smoke. Finally, the last two sentences are more interpretive than descriptive, using phrases like \"enhancing the sense of speed\" and \"emphasizing the action and skill.\" The description should focus strictly on observable facts, such as the car sliding sideways or the volume of smoke, rather than explaining the effect these visuals are intended to create.",
