    "pre_caption": "The video features a dimly lit, monochromatic interior with a man and a woman. The man, dressed in a dark suit, is positioned on the left side, walking towards the center. He has a medium build and short hair. The woman, on the right, is wearing a light-colored dress and has long hair. She appears to be standing still, facing the center. The setting includes a reception desk, a coat rack, and several chandeliers, creating a vintage atmosphere. The text \"The elevator is out of order\" and \"The phone is ringing\" is visible, suggesting a narrative element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description of the video as \"monochromatic\" is inaccurate, as it fails to mention the significant stylistic choice of selective color; the scene is entirely in black and white except for the vivid red liquid on the floor, which is not just \"dots\" but a clear trail of smeared footprints leading from off-screen. The description of the man is too general, omitting that his white shirt is rumpled and untucked and that his movement is not a simple walk but a tense, cautious stride as he limps slightly, clutching his left side. The use of the subjective term \"vintage atmosphere\" is a weakness; it would be more effective to describe the specific visual details that create this feeling, such as the flickering light from the crystal chandeliers casting long, distorted shadows, and the thick layer of dust visible on the unmanned reception desk. Furthermore, while the caption correctly notes the on-screen text \"The phone is ringing,\" it misses the crucial corresponding visual of an old, black rotary phone on the desk, which is visibly shaking and has a small, flashing red light on its base, directly linking the text to a physical object in the scene and heightening the sense of urgency.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a dimly lit interior with a selective color style, predominantly black and white except for a vivid red trail of smeared footprints on the floor. A man in a dark suit, with a rumpled and untucked white shirt, is on the left side, moving cautiously with a limp and clutching his left side. On the right, a woman in a light-colored dress with long hair stands still, facing the center. The setting includes a reception desk covered in a thick layer of dust, a coat rack, and several crystal chandeliers casting flickering light and long, distorted shadows, creating a sense of eerie nostalgia. The text \"The elevator is out of order\" and \"The phone is ringing\" appears on screen, with the latter linked to an old, black rotary phone on the desk, visibly shaking with a small, flashing red light, adding to the scene's tension.",
