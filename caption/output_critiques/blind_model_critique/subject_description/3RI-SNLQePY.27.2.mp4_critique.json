    "pre_caption": "The video features a dimly lit, monochromatic interior with a man and a woman. The man, dressed in a dark suit, is positioned on the left side, walking towards the center. He has a medium build and short hair. The woman, on the right, is wearing a light-colored dress and has long hair. She appears to be standing still, facing the center. The setting includes a reception desk, a coat rack, and several chandeliers, creating a vintage atmosphere. The text \"The elevator is out of order\" and \"The phone is ringing\" is visible, suggesting a narrative element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\nThe caption is good but has several significant flaws that violate the provided instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description of the subjects and their attributes appears to be accurate. It correctly identifies a man in a dark suit and a woman in a light-colored dress, their general positions, and their actions (or lack thereof). It also accurately transcribes the text visible in the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete in its description of the two main human subjects and the prominent text. It provides enough detail about their clothing, hair, and position to give a clear mental picture.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the caption adheres to or violates the specific rules:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is mostly simple and clear.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"man\" and \"woman.\"\n*   **Attribute Description:** It describes key visual attributes for the people, such as \"dark suit,\" \"medium build,\" \"short hair,\" \"light-colored dress,\" and \"long hair.\"\n*   **Pose and Orientation:** It correctly notes the subjects' positions (\"on the left side,\" \"on the right\") and actions (\"walking towards the center,\" \"standing still\").\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the man and the woman using their location and appearance.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Violation: Describing the background unnecessarily.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships.\"\n    *   **Caption:** The caption describes \"a reception desk, a coat rack, and several chandeliers.\" These details do not help distinguish the man from the woman; they are purely environmental descriptions, which the instructions explicitly forbid unless they serve a specific purpose. The mention of the \"dimly lit, monochromatic interior\" also falls into this category.\n\n*   **Violation: Using subjective and interpretive language.**\n    *   **Instruction:** \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" and \"Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"\n    *   **Caption:** The phrase **\"creating a vintage atmosphere\"** is a subjective interpretation of the scene's mood, not an objective visual fact.\n    *   **Caption:** The phrase **\"suggesting a narrative element\"** is an inference about the purpose of the text. The instruction is to describe what is visible, not to interpret its meaning or narrative function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a good starting point but fails on two key instructions: it includes unnecessary background details and adds subjective interpretations. A better caption would focus strictly on the objective, visual facts of the salient subjects (the man, the woman, and the text) without describing the setting or inferring meaning.",
