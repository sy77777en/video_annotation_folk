    "pre_caption": "This video features a dramatic landscape scenery shot that reveals a peculiar, sprawling house from behind a screen of tangled branches. The cobbled-together structure, complete with a rickety-looking tower and a large spherical tank on its roof, is perched precariously on a cliff edge overlooking a dense pine forest. In the distance, layers of mountains fade into a misty, golden-hued sky at either dawn or dusk. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to establish a sense of place, focusing on the grand scale of the environment and the mysterious, unique architecture of the building within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully follows many of the instructions but fails on one critical point.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"house,\" \"branches,\" \"tower,\" \"spherical tank,\" \"cliff,\" \"pine forest,\" and \"mountains.\" The description of the house as a \"cobbled-together structure\" on a \"cliff edge\" overlooking a forest is a precise representation of the scene.\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures the key elements from the foreground (tangled branches), midground (the house and forest), and background (mountains and sky). It also correctly notes the \"reveal\" of the house, which is a key action in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph, as instructed.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses specific nouns like \"house,\" \"tower,\" and \"tank\" instead of vague terms.\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots. It identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and explains that it \"lacks a single main subject\" because its purpose is to \"establish a sense of place\" and focus on the \"grand scale of the environment.\"\n*   **Describing Transitions:** It correctly describes the reveal of the house \"from behind a screen of tangled branches.\"\n\n**What the caption does poorly:**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** This is the most significant violation of the instructions. The instructions state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses several of these:\n    *   \"**dramatic** landscape\"\n    *   \"**peculiar**, sprawling house\"\n    *   \"**rickety-looking** tower\"\n    *   \"perched **precariously**\"\n    *   \"**mysterious**, **unique** architecture\"\n\n    Words like \"dramatic,\" \"peculiar,\" and \"mysterious\" describe a feeling or an opinion about the scene rather than an objective visual fact. While \"rickety-looking\" and \"precariously\" are more descriptive, they still lean heavily into interpretation rather than neutral observation. A more compliant caption would describe the visual facts that *lead* to these conclusions (e.g., \"uneven boards,\" \"leaning tower\") without stating the conclusion itself.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is structurally excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of how to describe a scenery shot according to the rules. However, its repeated use of subjective and emotional adjectives is a direct and significant violation of a core negative constraint. To be considered a \"good\" caption under these rules, it would need to be revised to remove this subjective language and focus only on objective, visual descriptions.",

The structure, complete with a tower and a large spherical tank on its roof, is situated on a cliff edge overlooking a dense pine forest. In the distance, layers of mountains fade into a misty, golden-hued sky at either dawn or dusk. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to establish a sense of place, focusing on the grand scale of the environment and the distinctive architecture of the building within it.",
