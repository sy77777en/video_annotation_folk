    "pre_caption": "This video features a dramatic landscape scenery shot that reveals a peculiar, sprawling house from behind a screen of tangled branches. The cobbled-together structure, complete with a rickety-looking tower and a large spherical tank on its roof, is perched precariously on a cliff edge overlooking a dense pine forest. In the distance, layers of mountains fade into a misty, golden-hued sky at either dawn or dusk. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to establish a sense of place, focusing on the grand scale of the environment and the mysterious, unique architecture of the building within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully identifies the main subject and setting, it relies on subjective adjectives like \"peculiar\" and \"rickety-looking\" instead of providing the objective visual details that create that impression. For instance, it could have described the house as being constructed from a patchwork of weathered wooden planks, grey stone, and rusted metal sheets, and noted that its main tower leans noticeably to one side. The description also misses a key detail suggesting the house is occupied: a thin plume of white smoke drifting from a stone chimney. The term \"sphero-cylinder tank\" is overly technical; \"a large cylindrical tank with a domed top\" would be more natural. Furthermore, the caption omits the quality of the light on the subject itself; it should mention that the low, golden sun illuminates one side of the house, casting long, sharp shadows that emphasize its complex, irregular form against the cliff. Finally, describing the reveal more specifically, such as \"a slow pan from left to right brings the house into view,\" would better capture the video's initial movement.",
