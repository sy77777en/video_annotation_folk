    "pre_caption": "A small red panda with reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and a white face with dark markings is visible through a rectangular window, though its features are somewhat obscured by the glass and reflections. As the view shifts, several zoo visitors appear, including adults and children, dressed in casual clothing of various colors and styles, some standing and others walking. The red panda remains inside its enclosure, separated from the visitors, and the people are positioned at different distances from the enclosure, observing the animal and the zoo environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a small rectangular window, through which a small red panda can be seen, though not clearly. The camera then pans left to reveal it is inside a zoo, showing some visitors and the zoo scenery in a wide shot.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres exceptionally well to all the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"red panda\" and provides specific, verifiable visual attributes (\"reddish-brown fur, a bushy ringed tail, and a white face with dark markings\"). It also accurately notes that the view is partially obscured by \"glass and reflections.\" The description of the \"zoo visitors\" as a mix of \"adults and children\" in \"casual clothing\" is also a precise and correct summary.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive, covering all the essential elements of the video. It describes the initial subject, the transition or shift in view, the appearance of new subjects, and the relationship between them (the panda is in an enclosure, and the people are observing). It successfully creates a complete narrative of the scene without leaving out key information.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, clear, and coherent paragraph. It is concise while still being informative.\n    *   **Holistic Description:** It masterfully combines details from the entire video into a single narrative. The phrase \"As the view shifts, several zoo visitors appear\" is a perfect example of describing a change over time without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Vocabulary and Tone:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. It correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Subject Identification and Attributes:** It uses precise terms (\"red panda,\" \"adults,\" \"children\") and describes their key visual attributes in appropriate detail. The level of detail for the red panda is high, as it is the main subject, while the description for the crowd is more general, which is appropriate for a group of secondary subjects.\n    *   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** The caption clearly distinguishes between the \"red panda\" and the \"zoo visitors.\" It follows a logical order, starting with the initial focus (the panda) and then introducing the visitors as they appear in the scene.\n    *   **Describing Transitions:** The caption effectively describes the change in the scene (\"As the view shifts\") and the result of that change (\"several zoo visitors appear\"), perfectly following the instruction to describe how subjects change or are revealed.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and structured perfectly to provide a clear and objective description of the video's content.",
