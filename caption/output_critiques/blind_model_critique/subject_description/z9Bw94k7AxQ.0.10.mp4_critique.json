    "pre_caption": "The video features a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body and occupying about half of the frame’s height. He is wearing a dark jacket and has short hair. The alley is narrow, with tall buildings on either side, and the man is moving towards the brighter end of the alley. The focus remains on the man as he walks, with the surroundings providing context to his movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video shows a man walking forward in an alley, with the camera tracking from behind. The man is centered in the frame, showing his upper body, but only occupying about half of the frame’s height, leaving more room for the surroundings.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption correctly identifies the main subject and action but lacks the specific visual detail necessary to paint a full picture of the scene. The description of the man as wearing a \"dark jacket\" is too vague; the video clearly shows it is a black, waist-length leather jacket with visible wear and tear on the shoulders. Similarly, his \"short hair\" is specifically a dark brown, closely-cropped cut. The caption's description of the alley is also incomplete, as it fails to mention the damp, reflective asphalt underfoot or the prominent, faded graffiti art that covers the lower portions of the red brick walls. While it notes he is walking towards a \"brighter end,\" it misses the significant visual effect of this being a sliver of harsh, overexposed daylight that causes the man's form to begin to silhouette against it. The final sentence about the camera's focus is an unnecessary analysis of the shot's composition rather than a description of the visual content itself and could be removed to improve conciseness.",
