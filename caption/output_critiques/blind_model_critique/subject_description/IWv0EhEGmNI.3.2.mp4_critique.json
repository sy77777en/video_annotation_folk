    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective seen through a green night-vision filter, a pair of hands wearing dark, textured gloves secures a thick, light-colored rope around a large wooden post. The left wrist features a dark-colored band with a watch-like device. The hands use a metal carabiner to fasten the rope to the post. Subsequently, a coiled portion of the rope is thrown downwards, unfurling into a long, glowing cyan line against the backdrop of a dark, distant town with illuminated buildings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It is highly accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is factually correct. It accurately identifies the first-person perspective, the green night-vision filter, the subjects (hands, gloves, rope, post, carabiner), and the sequence of actions. The description of the rope transforming into a \"glowing cyan line\" against the \"dark, distant town\" is a precise and crucial detail that is captured perfectly.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is thorough. It includes all the main subjects and their most important visual attributes, such as the \"dark, textured gloves,\" the \"large wooden post,\" and the \"metal carabiner.\" It also includes finer details like the \"dark-colored band with a watch-like device,\" adding to the richness of the description without being excessive.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative, using simple and natural English.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes, only mentioning the background (\"distant town\") when it becomes relevant to the action of the rope unfurling.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives, using descriptive terms like \"thick,\" \"light-colored,\" and \"glowing.\"\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise terms for subjects (\"hands,\" \"rope,\" \"carabiner\") and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **No Speculation:** It correctly uses the phrase \"watch-like device,\" which describes the object's appearance without making an unverified assumption about its function.\n    *   **Logical Structure:** The description follows the temporal order of events in the video, starting with securing the rope and ending with it being thrown. This makes the action easy to follow.",
