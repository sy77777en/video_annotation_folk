    "pre_caption": "The video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing a powerful weather event unfolding over a vast, open plain. The sky is dominated by immense, churning clouds tinted in ominous shades of orange, brown, and muted yellow, with a prominent, lower shelf cloud suggesting the leading edge of a severe storm. Veils of rain or dust can be seen falling from the cloud base across the horizon, which is punctuated by the faint silhouettes of utility poles and a distant mountain range on the right. There is no single main subject, as the composition's intent is to immerse the viewer in the powerful and awe-inspiring atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the sheer scale of the atmospheric display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main components of the scene, it misses several key visual details and violates the instruction to avoid subjective interpretation. The final sentence, which speculates on the \"composition's intent\" and uses emotional words like \"powerful\" and \"awe-inspiring,\" should be removed. The description of the clouds as \"churning\" is too general; in the video, the large central mass of the storm cloud exhibits a clear, slow, counter-clockwise rotation, a specific motion that is a primary feature of the event. Furthermore, the caption mentions \"a few vehicles\" but fails to specify them; a prominent red semi-truck is visible traveling from left to right on the road, and its bright color provides a crucial point of contrast against the dark landscape. The \"open field\" is not just a generic field but is covered in dry, pale-yellow grass, and the \"distant mountains\" are not just on the right but are a low, hazy blue range that stretches across the entire horizon behind the plain. Lastly, the description of the utility poles as \"scattered\" is imprecise; they form a distinct, straight line receding into the distance on the left side of the road, establishing a clear sense of perspective that the current caption overlooks.",
