    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw that prevents it from being perfect.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a \"coastal landscape\" and accurately describes its key components: a beach, waves, a rocky hill with greenery, the ocean, and a sky with clouds. The description paints a clear and correct picture of the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It follows the specific instructions for a scenery shot by not only identifying the type of scene but also explaining *why* there is no main subject. The final sentence effectively clarifies that the focus is on the overall environment rather than a specific person or object, which is a key requirement of the instructions.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is clear, and the description is concise while remaining informative.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"thing.\"\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and provides the required explanation for the lack of a salient subject.\n    *   **Descriptive Language:** It uses good, objective descriptive language for the physical attributes of the landscape, such as \"rocky hill covered in patches of greenery\" and \"deep blue of the ocean.\"\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The primary issue is the use of subjective adjectives that convey emotion or feeling. The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule with the words:\n        *   \"serene\"\n        *   \"gentle\"\n        *   \"natural beauty\"\n        *   \"tranquility\"\n        *   \"peacefulness\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is well-structured, accurate, and follows most of the complex instructions very well, especially the specific rule for describing scenery shots. However, its repeated use of subjective and emotive adjectives is a direct violation of a key negative constraint. To be considered a perfect caption according to the rules, these subjective words would need to be removed or replaced with more neutral, objective descriptions.",
