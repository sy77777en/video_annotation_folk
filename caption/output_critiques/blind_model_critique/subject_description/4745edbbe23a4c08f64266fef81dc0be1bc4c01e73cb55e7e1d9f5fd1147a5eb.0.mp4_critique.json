A prominent rocky hill covered in patches of greenery rises on one side, contrasting with the deep blue of the ocean and the bright sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The focus is on the natural beauty and tranquility of the environment, emphasizing the vastness and peacefulness of the scene rather than any specific object or subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the overall tranquil mood of the coastal landscape, it misses several key visual details that would make the description more vivid and accurate. The video appears to be set in the late afternoon, as indicated by the warm, golden light and the long, soft shadows cast by the rocky hill onto the sand, a detail the caption omits by only mentioning a \"bright sky.\" The \"prominent rocky hill\" is more specifically a formation of dark, jagged volcanic rock that dominates the left side of the frame, not just \"one side.\" Furthermore, the description of the beach is too general; the sand is a coarse, golden-brown, and the receding \"gentle waves\" leave intricate patterns of white foam on the wet shoreline. Finally, while there are no primary subjects, the caption fails to mention the few distant seagulls circling above the water near the hill, which are subtle but important elements contributing to the scene's natural ambiance.",
