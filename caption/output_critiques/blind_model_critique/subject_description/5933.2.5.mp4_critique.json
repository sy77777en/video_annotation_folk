    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a person's hands holding a small notepad and sketching with a pen. The hands have a light skin tone and are focused on drawing a detailed sketch of a lighthouse on the notepad. The sketch includes the lighthouse structure with surrounding lines indicating the landscape or additional features. The pen is actively moving, suggesting the drawing is in progress. The notepad is spiral-bound at the top, and the scene emphasizes the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is good but has a few key areas where it fails to adhere strictly to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate. It describes a plausible and specific scene—a close-up of hands sketching a lighthouse. The details provided, such as the light skin tone, the spiral-bound notepad, and the subject of the sketch, are specific and objective, suggesting a faithful description of the visual content.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies all the primary subjects (hands, notepad, pen, sketch) and describes their key visual attributes and the central action (drawing). It provides enough detail (spiral-bound notepad, lighthouse sketch) to create a clear mental picture of the scene without being overly long.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Concise and Coherent:** The description is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the salient subjects and their attributes rather than the background.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"hands,\" \"notepad,\" \"pen,\" and \"lighthouse.\"\n*   **Attribute Description:** It effectively describes visual attributes like \"light skin tone\" and \"spiral-bound at the top.\"\n*   **Action-Oriented:** It correctly mentions the action (\"sketching with a pen,\" \"actively moving\") as it is essential to understanding the scene.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Violation of \"No Meta-Terms\":** The caption begins with \"The video features...\". The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'\" and to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The word \"video\" and the phrase \"The video features\" are meta-commentary and should be omitted. The description should start directly with the subject.\n*   **Interpretive Language:** The final clause, \"...and the scene emphasizes the act of drawing and the intricate details of the sketch,\" is an interpretation of the shot's purpose rather than a direct description of what is visible. The close-up nature of the shot already implies this emphasis, so stating it is redundant and violates the principle of describing only what is seen.\n*   **Slightly Subjective Adjectives:** Words like \"detailed\" and \"intricate\" lean slightly subjective. While they function descriptively here, more neutral language like \"a sketch with many fine lines\" would be more strictly objective.\n\n### Corrected Version\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that fully adheres to all instructions:\n\nA close-up shows a person's hands with a light skin tone holding a small, spiral-bound notepad and sketching with a pen. The hands are drawing a sketch of a lighthouse, which includes the main structure and surrounding lines. The pen is in motion over the paper, indicating the drawing is in progress.",
