    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle, first-person perspective, a person's arm, adorned with a yellow wristband and clad in a black and white vertically striped sleeve, is visible in the foreground. The view looks down upon a large, paved concrete area set up as an extreme sports course. The course includes a large blue quarter-pipe, a smaller blue and black ramp, several small black wedge ramps, and a circular landing target with a white outer ring and a black center. As the perspective moves, the distinct shadow of a person attached to a rectangular parachute is cast upon the ground, indicating that the viewpoint is that of a parachutist descending toward the course.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it violates several key instructions. While it is detailed and mostly accurate, its structure and inclusion of inferential statements are incorrect.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe description of the visual elements is highly accurate. The details about the person's arm (\"yellow wristband,\" \"black and white vertically striped sleeve\"), the extreme sports course (\"large blue quarter-pipe,\" \"small black wedge ramps,\" \"circular landing target\"), and the shadow (\"shadow of a person attached to a rectangular parachute\") are all correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, successfully identifying and describing all the salient subjects in the video: the arm in the foreground, the course on the ground, and the shadow that appears. It effectively combines details from the entire video into a single narrative.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in three significant ways:\n\n1.  **Describing the Unseen (Major Violation):** The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" The caption concludes by stating, \"...indicating that the viewpoint is that of a parachutist descending toward the course.\" While this is a logical inference based on seeing the shadow of a parachute, the parachutist themselves is not a visible subject. The caption should only describe the visible shadow, not interpret what it means about the person holding the camera.\n\n2.  **Using Cinematographic Language (Minor Violation):** The instruction asks for a description of the subjects, not the way the video is shot. The caption begins with \"From a high-angle, first-person perspective...\" and later uses \"The view looks down upon...\" These are meta-descriptions of the camera work. A better caption would imply the perspective by simply describing the subjects as they appear (e.g., an arm in the foreground is visible above a sports course on the ground).\n\n3.  **Lack of Conciseness:** The use of the phrases mentioned above makes the caption less concise than it could be. By focusing strictly on the subjects, the description would be more direct and adhere better to the instruction to \"Keep the description concise and clear.\"",
