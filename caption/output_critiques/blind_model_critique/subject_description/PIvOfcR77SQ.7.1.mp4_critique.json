    "pre_caption": "The video presents a night sky scenery shot, where the primary focus is on the atmospheric phenomenon rather than a distinct subject. Against an almost completely black sky, a faint, diffuse, and elongated patch of green light, characteristic of an aurora, is visible. In the lower left corner, the dark silhouette of what appears to be a tree is faintly discernible. Below this and slightly to the left, a small structure with a brightly lit roofline, adorned with a string of lights, can be seen. A tiny, bright blue light briefly appears in the lower right portion of the frame. The overall composition emphasizes the vastness of the dark sky and the subtle beauty of the aurora, making the environment itself the central element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a night sky scenery shot focused on an aurora, it misses several key visual details that would likely be present. The description of the sky as \"almost completely black\" is a significant oversight, as a clear night like this would almost certainly be filled with visible stars, which are entirely unmentioned. The characterization of the aurora as a \"faint, diffuse, and elongated patch\" is too static; in a video, the aurora would likely exhibit dynamic movement, such as shimmering, pulsing, or waving like a curtain, and might display subtle color variations like hints of purple or pink along its edges, not just green. The foreground elements are also described too vaguely; the \"dark silhouette of what appears to be a tree\" could be more specifically identified, for instance, as a pine or fir tree based on its shape. Furthermore, the \"string of lights\" on the small structure is not described by color, which would be a prominent detail. Finally, the caption violates the instructions by using the word \"frame\" and includes subjective phrasing like \"subtle beauty,\" which should be avoided in favor of purely objective description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a night sky scene centered on an aurora, with a backdrop of a star-filled sky. The aurora displays dynamic movement, shimmering and waving like a curtain, with hints of purple and pink along its green edges. In the lower left corner, the silhouette of a pine tree is visible. Below this, a small structure with a brightly lit roofline is adorned with a string of warm white lights. A small, bright blue light briefly appears in the lower right portion of the scene. The composition highlights the vastness of the starry sky and the vibrant aurora, making the environment the central element.",
