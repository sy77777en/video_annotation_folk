    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"gray squirrel\" and the object it is on as a \"wooden post.\" The physical descriptions, such as the squirrel's \"white underside\" and \"large, bushy tail,\" and the post's \"rough, bark-covered\" texture, are precise and factual. The sequence of actions—from sitting upright to climbing down headfirst—is also described accurately as it would unfold in such a video.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete, successfully summarizing the key events of the video in a concise manner. It provides all the essential information: the primary subject, its key visual attributes, its location, its initial state, and the main action it performs. By describing both the static pose and the subsequent movement, it gives a full picture of the video's content without leaving out important details.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption perfectly adheres to all the provided instructions.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description centers entirely on the squirrel and its immediate environment (the post), as instructed.\n*   **Synthesis of Information:** It masterfully combines details from the entire video, describing the initial pose and the following action without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types (\"squirrel,\" \"post\").\n*   **Objective Language:** The description uses objective, descriptive adjectives (\"gray,\" \"bushy,\" \"rough\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Detailed Attributes and Actions:** It provides specific visual details for the subject and describes its pose and motion (\"sits upright,\" \"climb headfirst down,\" \"tail arches over its back\"), which is essential for understanding the video's content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and perfectly formatted. It clearly and effectively communicates the visual information of the video.",
