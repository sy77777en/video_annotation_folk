    "pre_caption": "A person's light-skinned hand holds a silver-colored metal utility knife with its sharp, trapezoidal blade extended. The tip of the blade is pressed against the black top bezel of a dark-colored foldable smartphone, right at the edge of the screen. The phone's large display has a blueish tint, and a small, circular grid pattern, indicating an under-display camera, is visible near where the knife is touching. The hand holds both the phone and the knife, positioning the blade to test the material of the phone's frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres closely to the provided instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and well-structured.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subjects: a \"light-skinned hand,\" a \"silver-colored metal utility knife,\" and a \"dark-colored foldable smartphone.\" The description of their attributes is precise, such as the \"trapezoidal blade,\" the \"black top bezel,\" and the \"circular grid pattern\" on the screen. The interaction—the blade's tip pressed against the phone's bezel—is also described correctly.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information. It successfully describes the state of the objects (blade extended, phone being held) and includes fine details like the blueish tint of the display and the pattern indicating an under-display camera, which adds significant value and context.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their visual attributes, correctly avoiding mention of the background.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise, objective language (e.g., \"metal utility knife,\" \"foldable smartphone\").\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption uses descriptive, neutral adjectives (\"silver-colored,\" \"dark-colored\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Detail and Specificity:** It excels at providing specific details for each subject as instructed (e.g., hand's skin tone, knife's material and blade shape, phone's features).\n*   **Handling of Action/Intent:** The final phrase, \"positioning the blade to test the material of the phone's frame,\" describes the purpose of the action. While this is an interpretation of intent, it is strongly implied by the visual context and helps explain the relationship between the subjects, which is permissible under the instructions. It is a reasonable and informative conclusion based on the visual evidence.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThis is an excellent caption that effectively meets all the requirements of the instruction. It is a model example of how to create a detailed, objective, and informative video description.",
