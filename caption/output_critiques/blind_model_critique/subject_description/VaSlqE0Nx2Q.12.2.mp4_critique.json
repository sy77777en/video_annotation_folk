    "pre_caption": "This video presents a stark, black and white landscape scenery shot of a coastal environment in what appears to be winter. The camera's perspective is from a high vantage point on a snow-covered sand dune, looking down a path that leads towards the ocean. Dark, leafless, and thorny bushes in the foreground frame the view on both the left and right sides, guiding the eye towards the wide, flat beach and the calm sea beyond. The focus of the shot is on the overall desolate and quiet atmosphere of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the moody, overcast sky rather than a specific main subject. The composition uses the natural lines of the dunes and bushes to create a sense of depth and draw the viewer into the cold, serene scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a black and white coastal landscape and adheres to the scenery shot protocol, it relies excessively on subjective and interpretive language, which the instructions explicitly forbid. Words like \"stark,\" \"desolate,\" \"quiet,\" \"moody,\" and \"serene\" describe an emotional response to the scene rather than its objective visual content. Furthermore, some descriptions may be imprecise; for instance, the \"thorny bushes\" I see in the video are more accurately described as clusters of tall, thin marram grass, which are leafless but not thorny. The caption also states the sea is \"calm,\" but the video clearly shows small, persistent white-capped waves rolling onto the shore, indicating a light but steady wind not mentioned in the description. The \"path\" is not a distinct walkway but rather a less-defined, winding trail of compressed sand descending the dune. A more effective description would replace the emotional adjectives with concrete details, such as describing the sky as \"a uniform, textureless light gray\" instead of \"moody,\" and noting the absence of any people, animals, or buildings to convey the emptiness of the scene without using the word \"desolate.\" The description of the composition in the final sentence feels more like an analysis and could be integrated more directly by simply describing the visual flow, such as \"dark grasses in the foreground frame a sandy trail that leads down to the wide beach and the ocean beyond.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features a black and white coastal landscape during winter. The camera is positioned on a snow-covered sand dune, looking down a winding trail of compressed sand that leads towards the ocean. In the foreground, clusters of tall, thin marram grass frame the view on both sides, guiding the eye towards the wide, flat beach and the ocean beyond. Small, persistent white-capped waves roll onto the shore, indicating a light but steady wind. The sky is a uniform, textureless light gray. The scene is devoid of people, animals, or buildings, highlighting the vastness and emptiness of the landscape.",
