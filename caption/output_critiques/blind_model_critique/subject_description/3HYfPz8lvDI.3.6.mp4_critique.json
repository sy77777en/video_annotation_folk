    "pre_caption": "The video features a man and a woman in a modern, well-lit room. The man, with short gray hair, is wearing a light gray suit and is seated on a brown chair, facing the woman. The woman, with long dark hair, is dressed in a gray top and pink pants, sitting on a brown leather sofa. Both are engaged in conversation, with the man leaning slightly forward. Two studio lights are positioned between them, illuminating the scene. A small round table with a book on it is placed between the man and the woman. Two cameras on tripods are set up, one on each side, suggesting a recorded interview or discussion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and the setting, it could be significantly improved by reallocating its focus and adding more specific details about the people. The description dedicates too much space to background elements like the paintings, sketch, and studio lights, which the instructions advise against unless essential for context. This detail would be better spent on the primary subjects. For instance, the caption misses key human attributes such as their apparent ages, skin tones, and facial expressions, which are crucial for a vivid description; the video likely shows them with engaged, professional expressions, perhaps smiling or gesturing as they speak. Furthermore, some object descriptions are inconsistent; the \"brown chair\" is vague compared to the \"brown leather sofa,\" and the \"book\" could be described more precisely (e.g., a closed, red hardcover book). Lastly, the caption uses the technical term \"out of focus\" and makes an inference by \"suggesting a recorded interview,\" both of which violate the instructions to describe only what is visible and avoid interpretation. A better approach would be to describe the cameras as \"blurry shapes in the foreground\" and let the visual elements speak for themselves.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a man and a woman in a modern, well-lit room. The man appears to be in his 50s, with short gray hair and light skin, wearing a light gray suit. He is seated on a brown chair, facing the woman. The woman, who seems to be in her 30s, has long dark hair and medium skin tone, dressed in a gray top and pink pants, sitting on a brown leather sofa. Both are engaged in conversation, with the man leaning slightly forward, displaying engaged and professional expressions, possibly smiling or gesturing as they speak. A small round table with a closed, red hardcover book is placed between them. Two studio lights illuminate the scene. Blurry shapes of cameras on tripods are visible on each side, adding to the professional setting.",
