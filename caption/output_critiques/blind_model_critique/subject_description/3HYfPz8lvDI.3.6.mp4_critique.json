    "pre_caption": "The video features a man and a woman in a modern, well-lit room. The man, with short gray hair, is wearing a light gray suit and is seated on a brown chair, facing the woman. The woman, with long dark hair, is dressed in a gray top and pink pants, sitting on a brown leather sofa. Both are engaged in conversation, with the man leaning slightly forward. Two studio lights are positioned between them, illuminating the scene. A small round table with a book on it is placed between the man and the woman. Two cameras on tripods are set up, one on each side, suggesting a recorded interview or discussion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions provided. While it is generally accurate and easy to understand, it violates specific negative constraints regarding subjectivity, inference, and background details.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its factual descriptions. It correctly identifies a man and a woman, their approximate hair and clothing details, their seated positions, and the presence of key objects like a sofa, chair, table, lights, and cameras.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It successfully identifies all the salient subjects (the two people) and the secondary subjects (the production equipment) that define the context of the scene. It provides enough detail to form a clear mental picture of the setup.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly. It violates three explicit rules:\n\n1.  **Violation of Objectivity:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"modern\" to describe the room and \"well-lit\" to describe the lighting. \"Modern\" is a subjective interpretation of style, and \"well-lit\" is a subjective quality judgment. A better approach would be to stick to objective facts, such as describing the light sources themselves, which the caption also does (\"Two studio lights are positioned between them\").\n\n2.  **Violation of Describing Only the Visible:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption concludes by stating the setup is \"suggesting a recorded interview or discussion.\" This is an inference about the purpose of the scene, not a direct visual observation. The caption should only describe the presence of the \"two cameras on tripods\" without interpreting their function.\n\n3.  **Violation of Avoiding Background Details:** The instruction says, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects...\" The caption begins by describing the setting as \"a modern, well-lit room.\" This background information is not essential for identifying or distinguishing the subjects and should have been omitted to maintain focus strictly on the subjects themselves.\n\nIn summary, while the caption creates a clear and accurate picture for a general audience, it does not follow the strict, technical requirements of the prompt. A good caption, according to the provided instructions, would be more clinical and limited to objective, visual facts, avoiding any form of interpretation, subjective language, or non-essential background information.",
