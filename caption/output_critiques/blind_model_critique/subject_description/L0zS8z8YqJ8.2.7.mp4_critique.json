    "pre_caption": "The video features a grey train observation car, shown from both the exterior and interior. Inside the dimly lit car, numerous identical mannequins are seated in rows of dark, high-backed chairs. These humanoid figures have a smooth, reflective, chrome-like surface and lack any discernible facial features. All the mannequins are posed sitting upright, looking out the large panoramic windows.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a wide shot of a moving train, capturing its last carriage from the outside. The camera then transitions inside, revealing a room filled with mannequins sitting while a natural landscape passes by outside.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is highly accurate, complete, and adheres meticulously to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is perfectly accurate.\n*   It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"grey train observation car.\"\n*   It accurately notes that the video shows both \"exterior and interior\" views.\n*   The description of the interior is precise: \"dimly lit,\" \"rows of dark, high-backed chairs,\" and \"large panoramic windows.\"\n*   The description of the mannequins is spot-on: \"humanoid figures,\" \"smooth, reflective, chrome-like surface,\" \"lack any discernible facial features,\" and \"posed sitting upright.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential information needed to understand the video's content without being overly detailed.\n*   It identifies the primary subject (the train car) and the secondary subjects (the mannequins and chairs).\n*   It provides the most important visual attributes for each subject (color, material, pose).\n*   By mentioning that the video shows both the exterior and interior, it effectively summarizes the video's structure and progression.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule in the instructions flawlessly.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is a single, tight paragraph that conveys a lot of information efficiently.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the train car and the mannequins within it, correctly identifying them as the key subjects.\n*   **Synthesizes Video Content:** It combines details from the entire video (\"shown from both the exterior and interior\") rather than describing individual frames.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" (except in the introductory clause, which is acceptable for context).\n*   **Avoids Subjectivity:** The language is objective and descriptive. It uses factual adjectives like \"grey,\" \"dimly lit,\" and \"reflective\" while correctly avoiding subjective or emotional words like \"creepy,\" \"eerie,\" or \"strange.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses precise terms like \"train observation car\" and \"mannequins\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on the mannequins' \"smooth, reflective, chrome-like surface\" and their pose (\"sitting upright, looking out the large panoramic windows\").\n*   **Handles Multiple Subjects:** It correctly identifies the mannequins as \"identical\" and describes them collectively as a group, which is the most logical approach and follows the instructions for handling multiple similar subjects.\n*   **Logical Ordering:** It follows a logical structure, first introducing the setting (the train car) and then describing the subjects within it (the mannequins).\n*   **Handles Shot Transitions:** It addresses the cut between the exterior and interior shots concisely and effectively by stating the car is \"shown from both the exterior and interior.\" This is a perfect interpretation of the instruction.",
