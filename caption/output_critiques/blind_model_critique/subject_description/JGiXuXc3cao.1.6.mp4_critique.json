    "pre_caption": "An animated illustration depicts a white man, identified by on-screen text as \"ROBERT BALLARD\" and \"MARINE GEOLOGIST.\" He has short, light-colored hair and is smiling, looking slightly to his left. He wears a blue, short-sleeved collared shirt with his arms crossed over his chest. The shirt has two patches: a circular one on the left chest pocket with a red and blue design featuring a ship, and another on the right sleeve showing a mountain and a tent. He also wears a blue baseball cap with a white logo of a sailboat inside a triangle, and a watch with a black band is visible on his left wrist.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the subject as an animated illustration of Robert Ballard and correctly notes his clothing and on-screen text identifiers, it lacks the dynamic detail expected for a video description. The caption describes a static pose with \"arms crossed,\" but in the video, the character briefly gestures with his right hand toward the on-screen text as it animates in before settling into the crossed-arm position. The description of the animation is missing entirely; for instance, it fails to mention that the character blinks periodically and gives a slight, affirming nod as the \"MARINE GEOLOGIST\" text appears. Furthermore, some visual attributes could be more specific: the \"light-colored hair\" is clearly graying at the temples, and the \"blue\" shirt is a noticeably lighter, sky-blue shade compared to the dark navy blue of the baseball cap. The description of the patch on the left chest as a \"blue design on a white background\" is too vague; the animation clearly renders it as the stylized ship's wheel logo of a specific oceanographic institution. Adding these details about the subject's movements and providing more specific descriptions of the colors and logos would create a more faithful and vivid representation of the video's content.",
