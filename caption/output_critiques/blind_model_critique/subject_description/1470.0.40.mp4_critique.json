    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with light skin and short hair, wearing a mustard yellow jacket and dark pants. He is holding a blue corded phone to his ear, standing in a doorway with one hand on the door frame. The man appears to be engaged in a conversation. As the video progresses, the man exits the frame, leaving the door closed and the phone hanging on the wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **very good** and adheres closely to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"man\" and accurately describes his visual attributes: \"light skin,\" \"short hair,\" \"mustard yellow jacket,\" and \"dark pants.\"\n*   It accurately describes the key object, a \"blue corded phone,\" and the man's interaction with it.\n*   The description of the man's pose (\"standing in a doorway with one hand on the door frame\") and the final state of the scene (\"the door closed and the phone hanging on the wall\") is also precise.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is comprehensive, providing a full narrative of the video's content. It covers the subject's initial state, his primary action, and his exit from the scene.\n*   It successfully synthesizes information from the entire video into a single, coherent description, as instructed.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet packed with essential details.\n    *   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly focuses on the main subject (the man) and the key object (the phone).\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame\" to refer to the video itself. The use of \"exits the frame\" is acceptable as it describes the subject's action relative to the viewport.\n    *   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, fluent, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n    *   **Subject Transition:** It perfectly follows the instruction to describe a subject disappearing by detailing how \"the man exits the frame.\"\n\n*   **Minor Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The phrase \"The man appears to be engaged in a conversation\" is a slight deviation from the rule to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" While this is a very logical inference, it describes an assumed activity rather than a directly observable action. A stricter adherence to the rules would be to simply state the action, such as \"holding a blue corded phone to his ear,\" which is already mentioned.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis is an excellent caption that meets nearly all the complex requirements of the instructions. The description is accurate, detailed, and well-structured. The only point of critique is a minor inference that could be omitted for 100% compliance with the strictest interpretation of the rules.",
