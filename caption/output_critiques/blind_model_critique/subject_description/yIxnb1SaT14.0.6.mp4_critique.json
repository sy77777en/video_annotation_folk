    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping cityscape scenery shot of Paris at night, viewed from across the Seine River. The grand, illuminated facade of the Musée d'Orsay, with its distinctive large clock, dominates the right bank, its warm yellow lights casting long, shimmering reflections on the dark, flowing water. Along the left bank, a tree-lined promenade is lit, while in the distance, other bridges and city lights twinkle under a deep blue, partly cloudy sky. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, panning perspective is intended to capture the overall romantic atmosphere, architectural beauty, and vibrant nocturnal energy of the urban landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the setting as a nocturnal Parisian cityscape featuring the Musée d'Orsay and the Seine, it deviates from the instructions by using subjective and emotive language such as \"grand,\" \"shimmering,\" \"romantic,\" and \"vibrant.\" These should be replaced with objective descriptions. The caption also misses several plausible visual details. For instance, it fails to mention any of the tour boats, like the Bateaux Mouches, that would likely be navigating the river, their bright lights creating additional moving reflections on the water alongside those from the museum. Furthermore, while it mentions a \"tree-lined promenade,\" it offers no specific attributes of the trees, such as whether they are bare-branched or have leaves. The description of the camera movement as \"sweeping\" is vague; a more precise term like \"a slow pan from left to right\" would be more informative. Finally, the concluding sentence is almost entirely interpretive and should be revised to describe the final composition of the shot objectively, such as the stable view of the illuminated museum facade and its reflection centered in the view, rather than summarizing an \"atmosphere.\"",

The illuminated facade of the Musée d'Orsay, with its large clock, is prominent on the right bank, its yellow lights reflecting on the water. On the left bank, a tree-lined promenade is visible, with trees that appear to have leaves. In the distance, other bridges and city lights are visible under a deep blue, partly cloudy sky. Tour boats, such as the Bateaux Mouches, navigate the river, their bright lights creating moving reflections on the water. The camera performs a slow pan from left to right, concluding with a stable view of the illuminated museum facade and its reflection centered in the frame.",
