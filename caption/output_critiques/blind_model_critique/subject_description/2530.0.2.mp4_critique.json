    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a ballet dancer's feet, showcasing the dancer wearing well-worn, light-colored pointe shoes. The shoes have visible scuffs and wear, indicating frequent use. The dancer's feet are positioned en pointe, demonstrating balance and precision. The skin tone of the dancer is visible through the openings of the shoes, and the crossed ribbons are tied securely around the ankles.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few key areas where it fails to adhere perfectly to the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption appears to be an accurate description of a video showing a ballet dancer's feet in pointe shoes. It correctly identifies the subjects and their most likely attributes.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is detailed and complete, covering the subject (feet), the object they are wearing (pointe shoes), the condition of the shoes (well-worn, scuffs), the pose (en pointe), and other relevant details like the ribbons.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It correctly uses precise terms for the subjects (\"ballet dancer's feet,\" \"pointe shoes\").\n    *   It provides specific visual attributes (\"light-colored,\" \"visible scuffs,\" \"crossed ribbons\").\n    *   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly focuses on the main, salient subject.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of Objectivity:** The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule by using the word **\"elegance,\"** which is a subjective quality.\n    *   **Interpretive Language:** The caption includes phrases like \"demonstrating balance and precision\" and \"The focus is on the technical skill.\" While related to the visual, these are interpretations of the action rather than direct descriptions of what is seen. A more compliant description would simply state the feet are \"positioned en pointe.\"\n    *   **Meta-Commentary:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\" and ends with \"The focus is on...\". This is meta-commentary about the video's composition and intent, which is discouraged. The instructions ask for a direct description of the subjects themselves, not an analysis of the filmmaking.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good** because it is clear, detailed, and captures the essence of the scene. However, it is **not perfect** because it violates the strict instruction to remain purely objective and descriptive by including subjective and interpretive language (\"elegance,\" \"technical skill\") and meta-commentary about the video's focus.",
