    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, captured from a low, forward-moving aerial perspective over a vast, wet sand flat. The camera glides across the expansive beach, which is marked by varying shades of brown and beige sand, toward a calm body of water that reflects the muted, overcast sky. In the distance, a long range of dark, verdant mountains stretches across the horizon, their peaks softened by a light haze. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to convey the immense scale and serene, slightly somber atmosphere of the coastal environment. The focus is on the interplay between the land, water, and mountains under the soft, diffused light, creating a feeling of solitude and tranquility.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a landscape shot, it overlooks several specific visual details and includes subjective language forbidden by the instructions. The description of the sand as merely \"wet\" is insufficient; in the video, the sand is not just damp but has a mirror-like, glassy sheen, reflecting the detailed cloud cover of the overcast sky, and is textured with intricate, winding patterns left by the receding tide. The claim of \"no main subject\" is not entirely accurate, as a flock of small, dark shorebirds is visible foraging near the water's edge in the mid-ground, their presence accentuating the immense scale of the landscape. Additionally, the caption uses prohibited subjective phrases like \"serene, slightly somber atmosphere\" and \"feeling of solitude and tranquility\" instead of objectively describing the visual elements that create this mood, such as the vast, empty space, muted color palette, and lack of human presence. The description of the drone's movement could also be more precise; it's not just \"forward-moving\" but a smooth, low-altitude glide that maintains a slight downward angle, emphasizing the textures of the sand rushing by.",
