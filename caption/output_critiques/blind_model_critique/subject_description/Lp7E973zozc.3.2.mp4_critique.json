    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned, middle-aged woman with shoulder-length blonde hair is shown speaking. She is wearing a brown, long-sleeved, V-neck top with a matching brown belt at her waist. A small microphone is clipped to the neckline of her top. She wears bracelets on both wrists and a watch on her left wrist. Throughout the video, she gestures with her hands while talking and at one point holds a small, dark object in her right hand. Her facial expression is animated as she speaks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It successfully meets all the requirements of the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It uses precise and verifiable language to describe the subject's appearance and actions. For example, it specifies \"shoulder-length blonde hair,\" \"V-neck top,\" and \"bracelets on both wrists.\" The description of the object she holds as a \"small, dark object\" is also a mark of accuracy, as it avoids making an unsubstantiated guess about what the object is.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It provides a comprehensive overview of the subject, covering her physical attributes (skin tone, age, hair), clothing (top, belt), accessories (microphone, bracelets, watch), and key actions (speaking, gesturing, holding an object). It gives the reader a full and detailed mental picture of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption adheres perfectly to the provided instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and packed with essential details.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the main subject (the woman) and her visual attributes, as instructed.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It successfully synthesizes information from the entire video (\"Throughout the video,\" \"at one point\") without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject identification (\"woman\"). It also avoids subjective emotional adjectives, using \"animated\" to factually describe the movement in her facial expression rather than an emotion.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on clothing, accessories, and actions, just as the instructions require.\n*   **Clarity and Language:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.",
