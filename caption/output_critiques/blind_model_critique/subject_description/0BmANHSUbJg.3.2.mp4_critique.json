    "pre_caption": "The video features two men in a well-lit indoor setting. The man on the left is wearing a gray suit with a white shirt and a beige tie, accented by a red flower on his lapel. He has short brown hair and a clean-shaven face, appearing to be in his 30s. His expression shifts from speaking to a more neutral look. The second man, partially visible on the right, is dressed in a dark suit with a white shirt. His hair is light brown and styled neatly. Both men are standing and facing each other, suggesting a conversation or interaction between them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies two men as the subjects and precisely describes their appearance. Details such as the \"gray suit,\" \"white shirt,\" \"beige tie,\" and \"red flower on his lapel\" for the man on the left are all correct. The description of the second man in a \"dark suit\" and with \"light brown\" hair is also accurate, as is the observation that he is only \"partially visible.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe description is very complete and captures the most essential information. It provides key visual attributes for both subjects, including clothing, hairstyle, and facial hair. It successfully creates a holistic summary of the video by noting the man's changing expression (\"shifts from speaking to a more neutral look\"), which indicates it's describing the action over time rather than a static moment. It also correctly notes their orientation (\"standing and facing each other\").\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of and adherence to the rules:\n\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that is both concise and informative.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It correctly focuses on the two men, providing detailed descriptions without getting distracted by the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses neutral, descriptive language and avoids subjective adjectives. For example, it describes the man's expression as \"neutral\" rather than \"bored\" or \"uninterested.\"\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the two subjects by their location (\"man on the left,\" \"man... on the right\").\n*   **Handling of Inference:** The final phrase, \"suggesting a conversation or interaction between them,\" is a minor inference. However, it is a very logical conclusion based on the visual evidence (two people facing each other, one speaking) and the use of the word \"suggesting\" appropriately qualifies it as an interpretation rather than a stated fact. This is an acceptable and helpful way to describe the relationship between the subjects without violating the spirit of the instructions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the detailed instructions almost perfectly. It successfully translates the visual information from the video into a clear and objective text description.",
