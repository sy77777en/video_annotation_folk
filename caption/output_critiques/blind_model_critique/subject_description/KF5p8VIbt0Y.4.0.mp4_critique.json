    "pre_caption": "The video features two women with light skin, both wearing dark, loose-fitting garments and head coverings that drape over their hair and shoulders. The woman on the left has pronounced dark eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a somber expression, with her hand raised to her chest in one moment and her gaze directed slightly upward. The woman on the right, positioned closely beside her, has similarly styled clothing and head covering, with delicate facial features and wide eyes, and she leans gently toward the woman on the left, looking up with a concerned or attentive expression. A third subject, a hand with light skin and long fingers, appears in the foreground, reaching toward the two women. In the background, a partially visible face of another person can be seen, but their features are obscured by shadow and distance. The overall focus remains on the two women and the reaching hand, with their close proximity and attentive postures suggesting a shared moment of concern or attention.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the three main subjects—two women and a hand—and their general appearance, it misses some key relational details and specificity that would make the scene clearer. The description of the hand \"brushing the air\" is too vague; in the video, the hand, which appears to be a man's due to its size and structure, makes a clear and deliberate sign of a cross or blessing in the space just before the left woman's face, without making physical contact. The caption also fails to connect the subjects' gazes; both women are not just looking \"upward\" or \"at the other woman\" but are intently focused on the hand and its symbolic gesture, which is the central action of the scene. Furthermore, the description of their clothing as \"dark, loose-fitting garments\" could be more specific by noting the coarse, wool-like texture and the style of the head coverings, which are simple, draped veils reminiscent of historical or religious attire. Finally, while the hand enters from the foreground, its arm, clad in a similarly dark sleeve, is briefly visible, indicating it belongs to a third person standing just out of frame rather than being a disembodied subject. Incorporating these details would better convey the solemn, ritualistic interaction that is the video's focal point.",
