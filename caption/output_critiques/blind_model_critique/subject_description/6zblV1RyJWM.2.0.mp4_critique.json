    "pre_caption": "The video features a large African elephant prominently in the foreground. The elephant has a textured, gray skin with visible wrinkles and large, fan-like ears. Its tusks are long and curved, with a slightly worn appearance. The elephant's trunk is thick and muscular, hanging down in front of its face. Its eyes are small and dark, set beneath a prominent brow. The elephant is facing forward, occupying most of the frame, showcasing its massive size and distinctive features.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as an \"African elephant\" and precisely describes its key visual attributes, such as its textured gray skin, large ears, long curved tusks, and thick trunk. These details are factually correct for the species.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It covers the subject's type, its most important physical features in detail (skin, ears, tusks, trunk, eyes), its position within the scene (\"prominently in the foreground\"), and its orientation (\"facing forward\"). It provides a comprehensive visual summary of the subject.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that is both brief and rich with descriptive detail.\n    *   **Focus on the Subject:** It focuses entirely on the elephant, describing its visual characteristics without getting distracted by the background or other non-essential elements.\n    *   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The description is objective and factual. It avoids emotional language (e.g., \"majestic,\" \"gentle\") and sticks to what is visually verifiable. Adjectives like \"large\" and \"massive\" are used appropriately to describe scale, which is a key visual attribute.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It uses the precise term \"African elephant\" and avoids vague words. It also correctly avoids meta-terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing key visual attributes with specific language, such as \"textured, gray skin with visible wrinkles,\" \"large, fan-like ears,\" and \"long and curved\" tusks.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single, clean paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
