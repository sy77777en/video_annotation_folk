    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It masterfully adheres to all the instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and perfectly formatted.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is perfectly accurate. It correctly identifies the Greek letters as \"ΠΑΧΩΝ\" and precisely describes the visual transformation they undergo—from \"dark, shadowy indentations\" to \"bright, glowing white.\" The description of the background as a \"textured, rocky surface\" with \"layered, uneven texture\" and shades of \"green, brown, and grey\" is also a faithful representation of the visual information.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive without being verbose. It captures the most critical elements:\n1.  **The primary subject:** The Greek word \"ΠΑΧΩΝ.\"\n2.  **The secondary subject/setting:** The rocky surface.\n3.  **The key action/transition:** The process of the letters illuminating.\n\nBy including the initial state, the final state, and the transition between them, the caption provides a complete summary of the video's entire duration.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions with exceptional precision:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph that conveys all necessary information without wasted words.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly identifies the subjects (\"the Greek word,\" \"the background surface\") and describes their key visual attributes in detail.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It perfectly synthesizes the entire video's action (\"initially appearing as... gradually illuminate\") into a single narrative, avoiding any reference to specific frames.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Handling of Background and Motion:** It mentions the background (\"rocky surface\") because the main subject is \"superimposed on\" it, making it essential for context. It describes the motion (\"gradually illuminate\") because this is the central action of the video and the primary change the subject undergoes. This is a perfect application of the rule.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"textured,\" \"layered,\" \"uneven,\" \"dark,\" \"bright\") and avoids subjective or emotional language. The phrase \"suggesting a natural rock formation\" is a reasonable, evidence-based inference, not baseless speculation.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses the precise term \"Greek word\" and identifies the specific letters.\n*   **Logical Order:** It correctly prioritizes the most salient subject (the word) before describing the surface it rests on.\n*   **Describing Transitions:** The caption's greatest strength is how it describes the subject's transition over time. The phrasing \"initially appearing as... gradually illuminate to...\" is an elegant way to describe a change without breaking the flow of the paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is clear, detailed, and technically flawless.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases the Greek word \"ΠΑΧΩΝ\" set against a textured, rocky surface. Initially, the letters appear as dark, shadowy indentations on the stone, but they gradually illuminate to a bright, glowing white. The background surface features a layered, uneven texture with shades of green, brown, and grey, evoking the appearance of a natural rock formation.",
