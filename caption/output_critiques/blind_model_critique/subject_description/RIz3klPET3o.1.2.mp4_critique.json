    "pre_caption": "The video features a small, stylized figure resembling a person on a bicycle. The figure is simplistic, with minimal detail, and is depicted in black and white. The bicycle is also minimalistic, with thin lines representing the frame and wheels. The figure appears to be riding along a thin, black line that extends diagonally across the scene. The overall appearance is abstract and cartoon-like, focusing on the basic shapes and lines to convey the subjects.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the main subjects—the figure, the bicycle, and the colorful points—and correctly notes their minimalistic, black-and-white style. However, it could be more descriptive to better capture the visual experience. The description of the \"four colorful points\" is too general; it would be more informative to specify their colors, such as red, blue, green, and yellow, and their form, for instance, if they are solid dots or glowing orbs. More importantly, the caption implies motion by stating the points \"follow the figure,\" but it fails to describe the primary action of the video, which is the cyclist moving across the scene, for example, from left to right. Describing this fundamental movement is crucial for context. Additionally, the relationship between the points and the cyclist could be clarified—for instance, whether they appear sequentially to form a trail or simply follow as a fixed group. A more integrated description of the cyclist as a single unit, rather than a separate figure and bicycle, would also improve flow.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a small, stylized figure resembling a person on a bicycle, depicted in a simplistic, black-and-white style. The figure and bicycle are minimalistic, with thin lines forming the frame and wheels. The cyclist moves smoothly across the scene from left to right along a thin, black line. Accompanying the cyclist are four colorful points—red, blue, green, and yellow—that glow and follow the figure, creating a dynamic trail. These points enhance the abstract, cartoon-like appearance, emphasizing the movement and interaction between the cyclist and the vibrant orbs. The overall composition focuses on basic shapes and lines to convey a sense of motion and unity.",
