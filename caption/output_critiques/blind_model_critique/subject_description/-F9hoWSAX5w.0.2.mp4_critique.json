    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a dimly lit urban street scene with multiple subjects. Two people, both wearing dark clothing and hooded jackets, walk along the wet sidewalk. One person is slightly ahead, while the other follows closely behind. The street is lined with buildings featuring illuminated signs, including a recognizable fast-food logo and a pub sign. A few pigeons are visible on the ground, adding to the urban atmosphere. The overall scene conveys a typical city street with pedestrians and ambient lighting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it captures the general essence of the scene, it fails to adhere to several key requirements, particularly regarding descriptive specificity and objectivity.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nWithout access to the video, it's impossible to verify if the described elements (two people, wet sidewalk, specific signs, pigeons) are factually present. Assuming they are, the caption is accurate in its broad strokes. However, its quality is judged by its adherence to the instructions, not just its factual correctness.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and lacks the level of detail required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Subject Details:** The instructions mandate describing people with details like \"skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age, gender\" if they are discernible. The caption only provides \"dark clothing and hooded jackets.\" If these other details were visible in the video, their omission is a major flaw. If they were obscured by the hoods or lighting, the caption should have noted that to be more precise (e.g., \"two people whose faces are obscured by their hoods\").\n*   **Vague Object Description:** The phrase \"a recognizable fast-food logo\" is not descriptive. The instructions ask for specific features like \"color, material, shape, and distinguishing features.\" Instead of stating the logo is \"recognizable,\" the caption should have described its visual properties (e.g., \"a yellow, arched logo\" or \"a red and white sign with text\") so the reader can visualize it without prior knowledge.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption follows some rules but violates several crucial ones.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   It is a single, concise paragraph.\n*   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It correctly identifies subject types (\"people,\" \"pigeons,\" \"buildings\").\n*   It uses action (\"walk along\") and relative position (\"one person is slightly ahead\") to distinguish the two people, as suggested.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:** The caption includes phrases like \"adding to the urban atmosphere\" and \"conveys a typical city street.\" These are interpretations of the scene's mood and classification, not objective visual descriptions. The instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives\" is meant to prevent this kind of summary in favor of concrete facts.\n*   **Unnecessary Framing:** The caption starts with \"The video depicts...\" and ends with \"The overall scene conveys...\". This is redundant framing. The instructions call for a direct description that immerses the reader in the scene, not a report about the video itself.\n*   **Lack of Specificity:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption fails to provide the detailed visual attributes for both people and objects that are at the core of the captioning instructions. The goal is to describe *what is visible* in detail, and the caption remains too general.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two individuals, whose faces are obscured by their hoods, walk along a wet sidewalk on a dimly lit urban street. The first person, slightly ahead, wears a dark hooded jacket and pants, while the second person follows closely behind in similar attire. The street is lined with buildings, one of which displays a bright yellow, arched fast-food logo, and another features a red and white pub sign with text. A few pigeons peck at the ground, contributing to the bustling city environment.",
