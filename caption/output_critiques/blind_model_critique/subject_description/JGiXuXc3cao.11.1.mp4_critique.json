    "pre_caption": "An older, light-skinned man with white, combed-back hair is depicted in profile, looking toward the left. He wears a gray suit jacket over a white collared shirt. With his left hand, he holds the bottom of a large, rectangular photograph, while his right hand is raised, pointing with his index finger at the center of the image. The photograph itself has a teal-colored background and shows a dark, vertical, rectangular object with some mottled green and dark texturing on its surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly describes the subject as an older, light-skinned man with white hair, wearing a suit jacket and collared shirt. The description of his actions—holding a photograph with one hand and pointing at it with the other—is precise. The details of the photograph itself, including its teal background and the dark, textured object within it, are also factually correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the key visual attributes requested in the instructions. For the man, it includes his age, skin tone, hair, clothing, and pose. For the object (the photograph), it describes its shape, color, and the appearance of the object depicted within it. It provides a comprehensive overview of the scene's subjects.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:** The caption adheres to the instructions very well, with one minor exception.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, clear, and coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the primary subject (the man) and the object he is interacting with (the photograph), avoiding unnecessary details about the background.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It uses objective language (e.g., \"gray suit jacket,\" \"white hair\") and avoids subjective or emotional terms.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"man\" and \"photograph.\"\n    *   **Detail and Prioritization:** It describes the man first as the main subject and then describes the photograph he is holding, which is a logical order. The level of detail for both is appropriate.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Forbidden Terminology:** The instruction explicitly states, \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption violates this rule by using the word \"image\" in the sentence: \"...pointing with his index finger at the center of the **image**.\" To be fully compliant, it should have used \"photograph\" again or a suitable synonym like \"picture.\"",
