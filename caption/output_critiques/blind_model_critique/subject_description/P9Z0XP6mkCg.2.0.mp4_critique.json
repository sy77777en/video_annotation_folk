    "pre_caption": "From an over-the-shoulder perspective, a stylized, white humanoid figure is shown sitting at a desk and using a computer. The figure, which is out of focus, has a smooth surface and is visible from the upper back. The central focus is a black Sony computer monitor displaying a Wikipedia article for \"Alan MacMasters,\" which features a black-and-white portrait of a man with dark hair. To the left of the monitor, a sandwich rests on a small blue plate on the wooden desk. A black computer tower stands to the far left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video is filmed from the left rear side of a humanoid subject, showing them using a computer. The subject is blurred and positioned on the right side of the frame, with only half of their upper body visible. The computer screen, fully visible and in focus, occupies the center of the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the main subjects: the stylized humanoid figure, the Sony monitor, the Wikipedia article for \"Alan MacMasters,\" the portrait, the sandwich, the blue plate, and the computer tower. All visual attributes, such as colors, materials, and on-screen content, are described precisely.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It captures the overall composition (\"over-the-shoulder perspective\"), the state of the subjects (the figure is \"out of focus\"), their spatial relationships (\"To the left of the monitor\"), and the most salient details (the specific Wikipedia article). It successfully creates a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows every rule flawlessly:\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that conveys a lot of information without being wordy.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered on the subjects and their visual attributes.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types like \"humanoid figure,\" \"computer monitor,\" and \"sandwich.\"\n    *   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, neutral language (\"stylized,\" \"smooth,\" \"black-and-white\") and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Logical Order:** The description is logically ordered, starting with the framing subject (the figure), moving to the central focus (the monitor), and then describing the secondary objects on the desk.\n    *   **Clarity:** The relationships between subjects are clearly defined, making the scene easy to visualize.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and written in a clear, objective style. There are no improvements needed.",
