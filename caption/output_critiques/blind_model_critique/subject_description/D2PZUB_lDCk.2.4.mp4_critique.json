    "pre_caption": "This abstract animation features a dark, deep-brown background filled with glowing golden elements. At the bottom, a dynamic, wavy surface is composed of countless tiny, shimmering golden particles, creating the appearance of a digital sea or landscape. From a bright, horizontal light source at the horizon of this surface, numerous thin, vertical beams of golden light rise upwards. These beams are accompanied by a multitude of smaller, floating specks of golden light that drift and sparkle throughout the space, some moving upwards and others gently falling like snow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the core visual components and their colors, it could be improved by framing the scene more cohesively as an abstract landscape, as per the instructions for scenery shots. Instead of listing the elements as separate subjects, describing them as features of a single, unified environment would create a more fluent and natural description. The critique could also be more specific about the qualities of the light and motion. For instance, the \"thin, vertical beams\" could be further detailed by mentioning if they vary in thickness and intensity or if they appear solid or ethereal. Similarly, while the upward motion is noted, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the *pace* of the animation; specifying whether the elements rise slowly and gracefully or quickly and energetically would add a crucial layer of detail. Finally, the description of the \"wavy surface\" as being \"composed of countless tiny, shimmering golden particles\" is slightly redundant; these details could be integrated more concisely to improve the overall flow of the paragraph.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In this abstract animation, a dark, deep-brown backdrop sets the stage for a mesmerizing golden landscape. The scene unfolds with a dynamic, wavy surface that resembles a digital sea, crafted from shimmering golden particles. At the horizon, a bright, horizontal light source gives rise to a series of vertical beams of golden light, varying in thickness and intensity, creating an ethereal glow. These beams ascend gracefully, accompanied by a myriad of smaller, floating specks of golden light that drift and sparkle throughout the space, some rising slowly and others gently descending like delicate snowflakes. This cohesive environment captures the essence of an abstract, luminous landscape, inviting viewers into its serene and enchanting world.",
