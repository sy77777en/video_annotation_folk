    "pre_caption": "The video shows a man and a woman seated in the foreground, likely in a courtroom or formal assembly, with several other people visible in the blurred background. The man, positioned to the left and seen from the back, wears a dark suit jacket and has short, graying hair and a visible beard. To his right, the woman is shown in profile, facing towards the left side of the frame. She has fair skin, shoulder-length, straight brown hair, and is wearing a black top. Her expression is neutral and serious. Behind them, several rows of people are seated, though they are out of focus. Among them, a Black man in a dark suit with a red tie is visible on the left, and a woman with dark curly hair is noticeable in the row directly behind the main subjects. The setting features wooden pews or benches.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two primary subjects and the general setting, it lacks specificity and misses key dynamic elements visible in the video. The description of the man's clothing as a \"dark suit jacket\" is vague; the video shows it is a charcoal gray, single-breasted suit. Similarly, the woman's \"black top\" is more accurately described as a black silk blouse with a modest V-neck. The caption speculates that the setting is \"likely in a courtroom\" instead of describing the observable evidence, such as the dark, polished wood paneling on the walls behind the subjects, which, combined with the pews, solidifies the formal setting. Furthermore, the description is too static for a video, failing to mention the subtle action where the woman briefly glances down at a legal pad on her lap and the man turns his head slightly to the right, offering a three-quarter view of his face and revealing that his \"visible beard\" is a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper goatee. This movement contradicts the caption's claim that he is only \"seen from the back.\" Finally, the description omits small but distinct details like the single pearl earring visible on the woman's left ear.",
