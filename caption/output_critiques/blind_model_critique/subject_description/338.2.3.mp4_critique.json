    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with medium-length dark hair and a light skin tone, wearing a dark-colored top with intricate gold embroidery. She is seated at a table, holding chopsticks and eating from a plate of food that includes colorful vegetables. Her expression is attentive and engaged as she looks slightly to the side. In front of her, there is a glass of amber-colored liquid and a small bowl, suggesting a dining setting. The scene conveys a moment of dining and conversation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it violates several key instructions, primarily by including subjective language and speculation.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the visual details are correct (a woman with dark hair, a dark top with gold embroidery, eating with chopsticks), the factual description of the subjects and objects is accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete. It correctly identifies the main subject (the woman) and describes her key attributes and actions. It also includes relevant secondary subjects (food, glass, bowl) that provide context to the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to adhere to several important negative constraints:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The caption describes the woman's expression as \"attentive and engaged.\" These words describe an internal state or emotion, which is a subjective interpretation. The instructions explicitly state to avoid such adjectives. A better, more objective description would focus on observable facts, such as \"she looks toward the side with a neutral expression.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\":** The final sentence states the scene conveys a \"moment of dining and conversation.\" While \"dining\" is a reasonable inference from the act of eating, \"conversation\" is pure speculation. There is no mention of another person or of the woman speaking. This directly violates the rule against describing what is not visible.\n*   **Inclusion of Interpretive Summary:** The final sentence, \"The scene conveys a moment of dining and conversation,\" is an interpretation of the scene's meaning rather than a direct description of its visual components. The goal is to describe what is present, not what the scene implies or represents.\n\n### What the Caption Does Well\n*   It correctly follows the single-paragraph format without introductory text or Markdown.\n*   It successfully avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It provides a good level of detail for the main subject's visual attributes (hair, skin tone, clothing).\n*   The structure is logical, starting with the main subject and then describing the objects immediately around her.",
