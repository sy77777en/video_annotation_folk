    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with medium-length dark hair and a light skin tone, wearing a dark-colored top with intricate gold embroidery. She is seated at a table, holding chopsticks and eating from a plate of food that includes colorful vegetables. Her expression is attentive and engaged as she looks slightly to the side. In front of her, there is a glass of amber-colored liquid and a small bowl, suggesting a dining setting. The scene conveys a moment of dining and conversation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundation but misses several key visual specifics that would make the description more accurate. For instance, the \"plate of food\" is not generic; it is a white ceramic plate holding several pan-fried dumplings garnished with chopped green onions, and the \"small bowl\" clearly contains a dark, soy-based dipping sauce. The \"glass of amber-colored liquid\" also has visible ice cubes and condensation on its exterior, indicating it is a cold beverage. Crucially, the description completely omits the partial view of a second person. The forearm and hand of a man, wearing a watch with a brown leather strap, are visible on the right side of the table, providing essential context for the woman's engaged expression and the implied conversation. The description of her clothing could also be more precise; the \"maroon vest\" has a distinct velvet texture, and the \"gold embroidery\" on her black top forms a clear floral pattern around the neckline. Lastly, the final sentence is an unnecessary interpretation; describing the visual evidence of the interaction—her gaze directed off-screen toward the other person—is more effective than subjectively stating that the scene \"conveys a moment of dining and conversation.\"",
