    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an aerial cityscape, it is too general and misses the opportunity to describe the specific visual elements that make the scene compelling. The description could be improved by detailing the \"historic walled city\" itself, such as describing the thick, weathered stone of the surrounding wall and the dense cluster of buildings within, characterized by their varied red and orange terracotta-tiled roofs. The caption also fails to mention prominent architectural features that serve as visual anchors, such as a large, centrally located cathedral with a distinct spire and a bustling main plaza visible below. Furthermore, adding details about the warm, late-afternoon light casting long shadows across the structures would better convey the atmosphere. Mentioning the tiny, distant figures of people walking in the plaza and cars navigating the narrow streets would more effectively illustrate the \"expansive scale\" the caption aims to capture, grounding the abstract concept in tangible visual evidence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This aerial cityscape captures the historic walled city in stunning detail. The thick, weathered stone of the surrounding wall encloses a dense cluster of buildings, their red and orange terracotta-tiled roofs creating a vibrant mosaic. A large, centrally located cathedral with a distinct spire stands as a prominent architectural feature, while a bustling main plaza below adds life to the scene. The warm, late-afternoon light casts long shadows across the structures, enhancing the atmosphere. Tiny, distant figures of people walking in the plaza and cars navigating the narrow streets illustrate the expansive scale, grounding the scene in tangible visual evidence.",
