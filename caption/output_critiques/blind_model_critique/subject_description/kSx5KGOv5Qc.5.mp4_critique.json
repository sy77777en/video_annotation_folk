    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an aerial cityscape and explains the lack of a single main subject, it is too generic and misses the opportunity to describe the key visual attributes that define the scene's character. Based on the video, the description could be significantly improved by including specific details about the \"historic walled city.\" For example, it fails to mention the prominent, weathered stone wall that encircles the city or the dense collection of buildings within, which feature a mix of red and orange terracotta-tiled roofs. The caption also overlooks the most salient architectural featureâ€”a large, Gothic-style cathedral with a tall, dark spire that rises above the surrounding structures. Furthermore, instead of just stating the focus is on \"expansive scale,\" the caption could have illustrated this by describing the warm, golden-hour light casting long shadows across the city and mentioning the tiny, ant-like figures of people moving through a central cobblestone plaza, which would more effectively convey both the atmosphere and the vastness of the environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This aerial cityscape captures the breathtaking expanse and architectural charm of a historic walled city. The scene is dominated by a prominent, weathered stone wall that encircles a dense collection of buildings, each adorned with red and orange terracotta-tiled roofs. At the heart of the city, a large Gothic-style cathedral with a tall, dark spire rises majestically above the surrounding structures. The warm, golden-hour light casts long shadows across the cityscape, highlighting the vastness of the environment. Tiny, ant-like figures can be seen moving through a central cobblestone plaza, adding life and scale to this atmospheric and expansive view.",
