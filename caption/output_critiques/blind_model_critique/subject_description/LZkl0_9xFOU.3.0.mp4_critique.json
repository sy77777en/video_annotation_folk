    "pre_caption": "The video focuses on a rectangular computer screen with a dark bezel, displaying a sequence of user interfaces. Initially, a menu with white text on a dark blue-grey background lists options such as \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet\" (highlighted in light green), \"Clear Xbox Live configuration,\" and \"Create a new profile.\" The screen then transitions to show \"Testing Network Connection\" and \"Logging on to Xbox Live: 0 seconds.\" Finally, it displays a list of arcade games, including \"Banjo-Kazooie\" and \"Burnout™ CRASH!,\" each accompanied by a small icon, the game title, the label \"Arcade Game,\" and a \"0/200\" score, all on a light green background with several square icons to the right. Partially visible on the right side of the screen is a blurry, light-toned object, possibly a person's shoulder. Below and to the right of the screen, a stack of colorful magazines or books is present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately details the user interface elements on the screen, it makes a significant assumption by identifying the subject as a \"computer screen\" when the content—specifically the Xbox Live and Arcade game interface—strongly suggests it is a television screen. The description of the \"blurry, light-toned object\" as \"a person's hair\" is speculative; it would be more accurate to describe it as an out-of-focus form at the edge of the view, and if more of the person is visible, such as their shoulder or the side of their head, that detail should be included. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the action causing the screen changes; for instance, it should mention if a cursor or highlight moves to select the \"Test Connection to XePartnerNet\" option, as this action is what links the different UI states. Furthermore, the description of the \"stack of colorful magazines or books\" is too generic; if any titles or cover art are even partially visible, especially if they are gaming-related, this would be a key contextual detail to include. Lastly, the \"several square icons to the right\" on the final screen could be more precisely described, perhaps as the vertical navigation tabs characteristic of the Xbox 360 dashboard, and the description omits any potential reflections on the screen's surface, which are common when filming a display.",
