    "pre_caption": "The video features a large airplane with a distinctive design. The aircraft is predominantly white with a light blue stripe running along its fuselage. It has four engines, two on each wing, and a prominent tail fin. The nose of the plane is rounded, and the cockpit windows are visible. The landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground. The plane has a sleek, streamlined shape, and there are red lights on the top of the fuselage and the wingtips. The overall appearance suggests a modern, well-maintained aircraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few significant flaws that prevent it from perfectly adhering to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate in its description of the physical attributes. It correctly identifies the subject as an \"airplane\" and details its color (\"predominantly white with a light blue stripe\"), components (\"four engines,\" \"landing gear,\" \"tail fin\"), and specific features (\"red lights on the top of the fuselage and the wingtips\").\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers the aircraft's overall structure, color scheme, key parts, and current state (landing gear extended), providing a comprehensive visual summary of the subject.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It clearly identifies the subject type (\"airplane,\" \"aircraft\").\n*   **Detail:** It provides specific visual attributes as requested (color, shape, parts).\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the single, salient subject.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule multiple times.\n    *   \"...a **distinctive** design.\" (Distinctive is a subjective judgment).\n    *   \"...a **prominent** tail fin.\" (Prominent is a judgment of importance or size relative to other parts).\n    *   \"...a **sleek**, streamlined shape...\" (Sleek is a subjective term implying elegance and style).\n\n2.  **Speculation and Inference:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The final sentence is a clear violation of this rule.\n    *   \"The overall appearance suggests a **modern, well-maintained** aircraft.\" This is an interpretation, not a direct observation. \"Modern\" and \"well-maintained\" are conclusions based on the visual evidence, not the evidence itself. The caption should describe *why* it might look modern or well-maintained (e.g., \"The aircraft has a white fuselage with no visible dirt or damage\") rather than stating the conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is good because it is detailed, well-structured, and accurately describes the main physical features of the airplane. However, it is not a perfect caption because it fails to follow the critical instructions to remain completely objective and avoid subjective language and speculation. The use of words like \"distinctive,\" \"sleek,\" \"modern,\" and \"well-maintained\" introduces opinion and interpretation, which the instructions explicitly forbid.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a large airplane with a unique design. The aircraft is predominantly white with a light blue stripe running along its fuselage. It has four engines, two on each wing, and a large tail fin. The nose of the plane is rounded, and the cockpit windows are visible. The landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground. The plane has a streamlined shape, and there are red lights on the top of the fuselage and the wingtips. The aircraft's white fuselage appears clean and undamaged.",
