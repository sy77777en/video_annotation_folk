    "pre_caption": "The video features a large airplane with a distinctive design. The aircraft is predominantly white with a light blue stripe running along its fuselage. It has four engines, two on each wing, and a prominent tail fin. The nose of the plane is rounded, and the cockpit windows are visible. The landing gear is extended, indicating it is on the ground. The plane has a sleek, streamlined shape, and there are red lights on the top of the fuselage and the wingtips. The overall appearance suggests a modern, well-maintained aircraft.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview of the aircraft's general appearance and color scheme, but it misses several critical details and actions that are prominent in the video. It fails to mention the iconic \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" text along the side of the fuselage, the Seal of the President of the United States near the main door, or the American flag on the tail fin, all of which are clearly visible. The description is also too static; it mentions the plane is \"on the ground\" but omits that the video shows it actively taxiing on the tarmac. Furthermore, the caption completely overlooks secondary subjects and key events, such as the mobile staircase being positioned against the aircraft and the main door opening in preparation for deplaning. The statement that the nose is painted dark blue is an oversimplification, as the video shows the light blue band sweeping up under the cockpit, with the nose cone itself being a different, metallic color. Lastly, the concluding sentence about the plane appearing \"modern\" and \"well-maintained\" is a subjective judgment and should be replaced with objective visual facts.",
