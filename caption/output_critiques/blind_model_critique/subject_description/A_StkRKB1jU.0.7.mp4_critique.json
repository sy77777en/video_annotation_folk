    "pre_caption": "Two men wearing clown masks and dark clothing are seen running. The first man, positioned more to the right, wears a clown mask with blue paint around the mouth, a red nose, red paint around the eyes, and black eyebrows, and is dressed in a dark jacket. A second man, initially behind the first, also wears a similar clown mask and dark clothing. A third man, also in a clown mask and dark attire, is briefly visible running and raising a dark object, possibly a bag or cloth, above his head.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies three men as the subjects, notes their distinctive clown masks and dark clothing, and describes their action of running. The detailed description of the first man's mask (blue paint, red nose, red paint around eyes, black eyebrows) is specific and precise. It also accurately captures the brief appearance of the third man and his action of raising an object.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information about the subjects without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. It provides enough information to form a clear mental picture of the scene. It correctly focuses on the subjects and their key attributes (masks, clothing, actions) as instructed.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph that is both brief and packed with relevant information.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the three men, their appearance, and their actions, correctly ignoring the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or subjective adjectives.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses the precise term \"men\" and distinguishes them clearly (\"The first man,\" \"A second man,\" \"A third man\") using their position and order of appearance.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on the most visible attributes (the clown masks) while correctly omitting details that are not visible (e.g., facial features, hair).\n*   **Handling Uncertainty:** The phrase \"possibly a bag or cloth\" is a reasonable way to handle an object that is not clearly identifiable. While the instructions say to avoid describing what you are unsure about, qualifying the statement with \"possibly\" is an acceptable and informative compromise that acknowledges the uncertainty without making a definitive, and potentially incorrect, claim.\n*   **Describing Action:** It correctly includes the action \"running\" because it is a primary and defining characteristic of what the subjects are doing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is a high-quality description that is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the complex set of instructions with near-perfect precision. It successfully balances the need for detail with the requirement for conciseness, resulting in a clear and effective summary of the video's subjects.",
