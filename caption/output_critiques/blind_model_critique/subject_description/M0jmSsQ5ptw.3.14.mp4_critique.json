    "pre_caption": "The video opens on a long, white, cylindrical object suspended horizontally on a thin cable that stretches across a paved area. In the midground to the right, a yellow metal structure, which appears to be a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys, is positioned next to a tall black barrier. The camera then moves upward and to the right, shifting focus to a close-up of a different part of the apparatus. This new view shows a light-colored vertical post, on top of which a thick, gray, flat strap with a silver reflective stripe down its center moves rapidly over a black pulley wheel. A black cable is also visible, attached to the side of the post with a silver carabiner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"long, white, cylindrical object,\" a \"yellow metal structure,\" a \"post,\" a \"strap,\" and a \"cable.\" The descriptions of their attributes—such as the strap being \"thick, gray, flat\" with a \"silver reflective stripe,\" and the structure being a \"yellow metal\" mechanism with pulleys—are precise and match the visual evidence. The description of the action, with the strap moving \"rapidly over a black pulley wheel,\" is also correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive, describing both distinct phases of the video. It starts with the initial wider view, capturing the main objects and their spatial relationship. It then effectively describes the camera movement and the shift to a close-up, detailing the new elements that come into focus. It provides enough detail to create a clear mental image of the entire sequence without being overly long.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule in the instructions flawlessly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The description is centered entirely on the apparatus and its components.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Appropriate Use of Motion/Background:** It mentions the \"paved area\" for context and the camera/strap movement because they are essential to understanding the video's content.\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption uses descriptive, neutral language (e.g., \"long, white, cylindrical\") and avoids subjective or emotional words.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses specific terms like \"cylindrical object,\" \"winch,\" \"pulley wheel,\" and \"carabiner\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It excels at describing color, shape, material, and specific markings (e.g., \"silver reflective stripe\").\n*   **Shot Transition:** It perfectly describes the transition, noting the camera movement (\"moves upward and to the right, shifting focus\") and explaining what the new view shows.\n*   **Logical Order:** The description follows the temporal order of the video, describing the initial scene before moving on to the close-up, which is the correct approach.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a long, white, cylindrical object hanging horizontally on a thin cable that spans a paved area. To the right in the midground, a yellow metal structure resembling a winch or launch mechanism with pulleys is situated next to a tall black barrier. The camera then pans upward and to the right, focusing on a close-up of another part of the apparatus. This new perspective reveals a light-colored vertical post, atop which a thick, gray, flat strap with a silver reflective stripe down its center moves swiftly over a black pulley wheel. A black cable is also visible, secured to the side of the post with a silver carabiner.",
