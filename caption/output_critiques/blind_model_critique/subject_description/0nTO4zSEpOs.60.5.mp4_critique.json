    "pre_caption": "The video captures a bustling urban scene at night, featuring a modern cityscape with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. In the foreground, a walkway is visible with three people. A man in a dark suit and carrying a bag walks towards the camera, while another man in a similar suit walks away. A woman in a long, light-colored coat and wearing a mask walks to the right. The background showcases a busy street with several buses and cars, highlighting the vibrant city life. The overall atmosphere is lively, with the bright lights of the buildings contrasting against the night sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects without a clear main focus**. This video likely focuses more on the landscape, with some subjects present but not the main focus. In such cases, it's best to briefly describe these subjects' types without going into too much detail. If the video features many subjects, but it's unclear which one is the main subject, please describe all the subjects collectively as a group.\n\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it captures the general essence of the scene, it fails to adhere to several key negative and positive constraints.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   Assuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the facts presented (e.g., a night scene, three people, their clothing, actions, background elements) are likely accurate. However, without the video, a definitive judgment on accuracy is impossible.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The caption is incomplete in its description of the subjects. The instructions require detailed visual attributes for people, including \"skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression.\" The caption only describes clothing, accessories (bag, mask), and actions, omitting all other requested physical details for the three people.\n*   The description of the background subjects (\"several buses and cars\") is too vague. The instructions ask for details like color, material, or shape for objects, none of which are provided for the vehicles.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption fails most significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives\":** The primary failure is the repeated use of subjective and interpretive language. The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses:\n    *   \"**bustling** urban scene\"\n    *   \"**vibrant** city life\"\n    *   \"The overall atmosphere is **lively**\"\n    These words describe a mood or feeling rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Describing What Is Not Visible\":** The caption interprets the scene's meaning by stating it is \"**highlighting** the vibrant city life\" and describing the \"**overall atmosphere**.\" These are analytical conclusions, not direct visual descriptions.\n*   **Incomplete Subject Attributes:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption does not provide the required level of detail for the subjects' visual attributes, which is a core part of the instructions.\n*   **Minor Violation of \"No Introductory Text\":** The caption begins with \"The video captures...\", which acts as a small introductory phrase. The instructions ask to return \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A better approach would be to start directly with the description, such as \"An urban scene at night features...\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is not good because it fundamentally misunderstands the objective, descriptive nature of the task. It injects subjective interpretation and atmosphere, which the instructions explicitly forbid, while simultaneously omitting the specific, detailed visual attributes that the instructions demand.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An urban scene at night features a modern cityscape with illuminated skyscrapers and digital billboards. In the foreground, a walkway is visible with three people: a man with light skin, short black hair, and no facial hair, wearing a dark suit and carrying a bag, walks towards the camera; another man with medium skin, short brown hair, and a clean-shaven face, in a similar suit, walks away; a woman with light skin, long blonde hair, and no visible facial hair, in a long, light-colored coat and wearing a mask, walks to the right. The background shows a busy street with several vehicles, including red and blue buses and silver cars, highlighting the city activity. The bright lights of the buildings contrast against the night sky.",
