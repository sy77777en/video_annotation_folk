    "pre_caption": "In the video, a woman with light skin and dark hair pulled back is shown from the chest up, facing towards the right and looking slightly upwards. She wears a headset with a microphone positioned near her slightly open mouth. Her attire is a dark, patterned uniform featuring gold-colored insignia on the collar points. Partially visible behind her on the left is another person wearing a camouflage uniform with a circular patch on the upper sleeve.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects, it lacks the specificity and dynamic detail that would be present in the video. The description of the woman's uniform as \"dark, patterned\" is too general; in the video, it's clearly a navy blue digital camouflage pattern, and the \"gold-colored insignia\" are identifiable as gold oak leaf rank pins, indicating her specific rank. Her hair is not just \"pulled back\" but is styled in a tight, regulation-style bun. The caption misses the opportunity to describe the action; her \"slightly open mouth\" and upward gaze are part of the act of her speaking clearly and deliberately into her microphone, which is a central activity in the video. The second person is not just \"partially visible\" but is a man, also wearing a headset and looking intently at a monitor just out of frame, and the \"circular patch\" on his sleeve is a distinct squadron emblem featuring a stylized griffin. Finally, the \"partially visible hand\" on the right is actively pressing illuminated buttons on a complex control console, which is a key detail that establishes the setting as a high-tech command center or cockpit rather than just an abstract background. Adding these details about specific patterns, ranks, actions, and environmental interactions would create a much richer and more accurate description of the video's content.",
