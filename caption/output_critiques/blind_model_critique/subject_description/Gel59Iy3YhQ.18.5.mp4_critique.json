    "pre_caption": "A white goose with a bright orange beak and orange webbed feet is depicted in a simplified, low-polygon art style. It has a smooth, untextured body and small black dots for eyes. A woman, seen from behind, shares this stylized aesthetic; she has a pear-shaped body and is dressed in a maroon top, brown pants, and black shoes. Her form is minimalistic, with no discernible facial features and simple cylindrical arms. Other objects, such as a classic red British pillar box and a fruit stand with geometrically shaped produce, are also rendered in the same flat-shaded, cartoon-like style. A black A-frame sign displays a white circle containing a black silhouette of a goose with a red line through it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"white goose\" and precisely describes its key features like the \"bright orange beak and orange webbed feet\" and \"small black dots for eyes.\" The description of the woman is also accurate, noting her \"maroon top, brown pants,\" her \"pear-shaped body,\" and the fact she is \"seen from behind.\" The descriptions of the environmental objects, such as the \"red British pillar box\" and the \"black A-frame sign\" with the goose silhouette, are also spot-on.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It doesn't just describe one subject; it provides a holistic view of the scene's key elements. It successfully identifies the main character (goose), the player character (woman), and other significant objects that establish the setting. Crucially, it identifies the unifying \"simplified, low-polygon art style,\" which is essential for understanding the video's aesthetic. This shows a comprehensive understanding of the visual information.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a lot of descriptive information into a single, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** The entire caption is dedicated to describing the subjects (goose, woman, objects) and their specific visual characteristics (color, shape, style).\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective terms (\"low-polygon,\" \"maroon,\" \"cylindrical\") and avoids subjective emotional words.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses clear and precise terms like \"goose,\" \"woman,\" and \"pillar box.\"\n*   **Logical Order:** It correctly prioritizes the most salient subject (the goose), followed by the secondary character (the woman), and then the environmental objects.\n*   **Single Paragraph Format:** The output is a single, well-structured paragraph with no introductory text or markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary response that perfectly balances detail with conciseness while strictly adhering to every rule in the provided instructions.",
