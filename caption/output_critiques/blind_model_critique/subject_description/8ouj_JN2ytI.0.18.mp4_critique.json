    "pre_caption": "The video shows a large group of people, mostly men, walking forward in a dimly lit, narrow, enclosed space. Many are dressed in dark uniforms, with some individuals wearing police hats or helmets. The word \"POLICE\" is visible in white capital letters on the back of at least one person's uniform, and \"GCPD\" can be seen on the back of another. The individuals are clustered together, moving in the same direction.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview but misses key details that contribute to the video's intensity and context. While it correctly identifies the subjects as police officers, it under-describes their appearance; many are not just in 'dark uniforms' but are equipped with heavy tactical vests, with the 'POLICE' marking on the back of these vests, and several are carrying rifles at a low-ready position, not just standard patrol gear. The description of the action as 'walking forward' is too generic; the officers are moving in a tight, coordinated formation, suggesting a tactical advance, not a casual walk. Furthermore, the caption states they 'all suddenly stop and turn,' but the video shows a lead officer initiating the halt with a clear hand signal, after which the group pivots in a practiced, uniform manner. Finally, the 'enclosed space' could be more specifically described as a concrete underground corridor, and the dim lighting is characterized by harsh overhead sources creating deep shadows, which adds to the tense atmosphere that the current caption doesn't fully capture.",
