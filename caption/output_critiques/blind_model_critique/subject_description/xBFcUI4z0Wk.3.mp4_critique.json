    "pre_caption": "A black and yellow number 2 Chevrolet Camaro race car is stopped on a wet surface, positioned partially on an asphalt track with two yellow lines and partially on a grassy incline. The rear half of the car is yellow with \"GimmeCountry.com\" in large white letters, while the front half is black with a \"Gimme Country\" logo on the hood. A large white number \"2\" is on the side door, accompanied by sponsors like \"Pinnacle\" and \"ALSCO.\" White smoke or steam continuously billows from the front of the car, obscuring parts of the hood. A white vehicle, possibly a safety car with its headlights on, briefly appears on the left side of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the specific race car, its livery, and the general situation, it overlooks several key visual elements that would be central to the scene. Most critically, there is no mention of the driver, who would likely be visible either inside the cockpit, possibly gesturing or looking towards the track, or in the process of climbing out of the car. The description of the car's condition is also incomplete; beyond the smoke, there is likely visible damage, such as a crumpled front splitter, scuffed paint along the side, or a dislodged rear bumper, which would provide context for why the car is stopped. The \"white smoke\" could be more precisely described as dense steam erupting from a specific point under the hood, consistent with a radiator failure on a wet track. Furthermore, the description of the safety vehicle is too passive; its lightbar would be actively flashing with vibrant yellow or red lights, not just \"activated.\" Finally, the scene would almost certainly include other elements, such as other race cars driving past slowly under yellow flag conditions or track marshals in brightly colored fire suits running towards the disabled Camaro, all of which are salient subjects that are missing from the description.",
