    "pre_caption": "A massive, bipedal, frog-like monster with bloated, light green skin appears in a video game. The creature wears a dark harness across its large chest and wields a large, axe-like weapon that glows with a red light. It confronts a much smaller, cloaked figure. This small figure is dressed in dark purple and black, with a pale face visible, and carries a weapon that emits a purple glow.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the instructions very well.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two main subjects as a \"bipedal, frog-like monster\" and a \"cloaked figure.\" The descriptions of their visual attributes are precise, matching what is typically seen in such a video: the monster's \"bloated, light green skin,\" \"dark harness,\" and \"axe-like weapon that glows with a red light,\" as well as the smaller figure's \"dark purple and black\" clothing, \"pale face,\" and \"weapon that emits a purple glow.\" The relationship between them (\"confronts\") is also accurately described.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential details needed to visualize the scene. It provides sufficient information about both subjects' appearance, size relationship (\"massive\" vs. \"much smaller\"), and key possessions (their glowing weapons) without getting lost in minor, irrelevant details.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption successfully follows all the given rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to read while being packed with descriptive information.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The description is entirely focused on the two subjects and their key attributes. It correctly avoids mentioning the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives. Words like \"massive\" and \"large\" are used as objective descriptors of size and scale, which is appropriate.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses clear and specific terms (\"monster,\" \"figure\") and distinguishes them effectively by their appearance.\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** The description of skin color, clothing, and weapons is specific and detailed, as requested.\n*   **Subject Prioritization:** It correctly begins with the larger, more visually dominant subject (the monster) before moving to the smaller one.\n*   **Contextual Information:** The inclusion of \"in a video game\" is a good choice. While not a direct visual attribute of the subjects themselves, it provides essential context that explains their fantastical nature, which is helpful for the reader and does not violate the spirit of the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A colossal, bipedal, frog-like monster with bloated, light green skin emerges in a video game. The creature is adorned with a dark harness across its expansive chest and wields a large, axe-like weapon that glows with a menacing red light. It faces off against a much smaller, cloaked figure. This figure is clad in dark purple and black attire, with a pale face visible, and carries a weapon that emits an eerie purple glow.",
