    "pre_caption": "A group of people are seen on a wooden boardwalk at what appears to be a zoo. A woman with her back to the camera stands looking at an enclosure; she has brown hair in a ponytail and wears a long, light purple dress and a grey backpack. A couple walks past her from the right. The woman in the couple has shoulder-length brown hair and is wearing a cream-colored top, a long teal skirt, and carries a large blue and white tote bag. The man walking with her has short dark hair, wears a white face mask, a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt, and dark pants. Other people are visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects and their general attire, it misses several key visual details and fails to capture the dynamic of the scene. The description of the woman at the railing is incomplete; in the video, her head is turned slightly in profile, revealing she is a young adult with fair skin and is wearing small gold hoop earrings. Her dress is more specifically a lavender, sleeveless sundress. The caption's most significant omission is the interaction between the couple; the man has his arm around the woman's shoulders as they walk, and she is smiling up at him, establishing a clear affectionate relationship that the caption only implies by calling them a \"couple.\" Furthermore, some descriptions could be more precise: the man's \"dark pants\" are black jeans, and the woman's \"cream-colored top\" has a subtle floral pattern visible as she moves. The reference to \"other people\" is too generic; a man pushing a stroller with a child in a bright yellow shirt is briefly but clearly visible in the middle ground, which would add more specific context to the zoo setting. Finally, the camera's focus follows the walking couple, suggesting they are the primary subjects, so the description would be more accurate if it began with them rather than the more static woman at the railing.",
