    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant rainbow arching across a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a study in contrasts, with dark, heavy clouds looming over a lower expanse of light blue sky dotted with softer white clouds. Below, lush green rolling hills are covered in dense trees and vegetation, creating a rich, natural tapestry. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment, emphasizing the ephemeral spectacle of the rainbow against the post-storm sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and explains the absence of a main subject, it relies heavily on subjective adjectives such as \"vibrant,\" \"dramatic,\" \"lush,\" and \"rich,\" which the instructions advise against. Instead of \"dramatic sky,\" it would be more effective to describe the visual contrast objectively, such as \"a sky with dark, dense storm clouds on the upper left and a bright patch of blue sky on the lower right.\" The description of the rainbow could be more specific; for example, the video might show a complete, bright arc, or perhaps even a fainter double rainbow, which are key visual details. The caption also misses potential secondary elements that could add specificity; for instance, the video might include a narrow, winding dirt road cutting through one of the green hills or a small, distant farmhouse, which would ground the scene without becoming the main focus. Furthermore, the final sentence is overly interpretive with phrases like \"atmospheric beauty\" and \"ephemeral spectacle.\" A more concise and neutral explanation would be more aligned with the instructions. Lastly, the term \"sweeping\" implies camera motion; if the camera is indeed panning across the landscape, this action should be described directly (e.g., \"The view pans slowly from left to right...\") rather than being used as a static adjective.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a landscape scene with a complete rainbow arching across the sky. The sky is divided into two contrasting sections: dark, dense storm clouds occupy the upper left, while a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds is visible on the lower right. Below, green rolling hills are covered with dense trees and vegetation. A narrow dirt road winds through one of the hills, and a small farmhouse can be seen in the distance. The camera pans slowly from left to right, capturing the expansive view and highlighting the rainbow against the post-storm sky.",
