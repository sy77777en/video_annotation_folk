    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping landscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant rainbow arching across a dramatic sky. The sky itself is a study in contrasts, with dark, heavy clouds looming over a lower expanse of light blue sky dotted with softer white clouds. Below, lush green rolling hills are covered in dense trees and vegetation, creating a rich, natural tapestry. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment, emphasizing the ephemeral spectacle of the rainbow against the post-storm sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has several significant areas where it fails to adhere to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the key elements of a landscape scene: a rainbow, a sky with contrasting dark and light clouds, and green, tree-covered rolling hills. The description paints a clear and factually correct picture of the scenery.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the major components of the scene and their relationships to one another (rainbow in the sky, sky over the hills). It provides enough detail for a reader to visualize the entire landscape effectively.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has notable flaws.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and perfectly follows the specific instruction to explain *why* there is no main subject: \"There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural environment.\"\n*   **Structure and Clarity:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in natural English.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using prohibited words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses precise terms for the subjects (\"rainbow,\" \"sky,\" \"clouds,\" \"hills,\" \"trees\").\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** This is the most significant violation. The instructions state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption is filled with them:\n    *   \"**vibrant** rainbow\"\n    *   \"**dramatic** sky\"\n    *   \"**lush** green rolling hills\"\n    *   \"**rich**, natural tapestry\"\n    *   \"**grand** scale\"\n    *   \"atmospheric **beauty**\"\n    *   \"**ephemeral spectacle**\"\n    These words describe the *feeling* or *quality* of the scene rather than providing a neutral, objective description of its visual attributes.\n\n*   **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The instructions state to \"**Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.**\" The caption begins with \"This video presents...\", which is a form of introductory text.\n\n*   **Minor Speculation:** The phrase \"**post-storm sky**\" is an interpretation of the conditions that led to the scene, not a direct visual observation. While it's a logical inference, a more neutral description would stick to the visible elements, such as \"a sky with dark clouds and a rainbow.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the caption accurately and completely describes the scene and correctly follows the specific rule for scenery shots, it **is not a good caption** because it fundamentally fails the core instruction to be objective and avoid subjective, emotional language. The overuse of words like \"vibrant,\" \"dramatic,\" and \"beautiful\" directly contradicts one of the most important constraints.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a landscape scene featuring a rainbow arching across a sky with contrasting dark clouds and lighter blue areas dotted with white clouds. Below, green rolling hills are covered in dense trees and vegetation. The focus is on the expansive natural environment, highlighting the rainbow against the sky.",
