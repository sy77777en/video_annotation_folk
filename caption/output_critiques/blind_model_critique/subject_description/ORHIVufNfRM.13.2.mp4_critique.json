    "pre_caption": "This video shows a first-person, underwater perspective of a bioluminescent alien forest. The scene is filled with tall, dark, trunk-like structures that have a porous texture and are adorned with glowing green, peanut-shaped organisms. These trunks support numerous flat, disc-shaped caps that are reddish-orange on top and have a lighter, honeycomb-like texture on their undersides. A large school of small, dark, fish-like creatures with glowing purple and green outlines swims throughout the environment. In the background, a very large, dark, whale-like creature with a long, sinuous body glides between the mushroom trees. Other small life forms are visible, including glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures and floating pink rings. The view is framed by the dark red border of a helmet or viewport, and occasionally, two gloved hands in an orange and black suit appear at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is extremely accurate in its description of the video's content.\n*   It correctly identifies the scene as a \"first-person, underwater perspective of a bioluminescent alien forest.\"\n*   The descriptions of the subjects are precise: \"tall, dark, trunk-like structures\" with \"glowing green, peanut-shaped organisms\" and \"reddish-orange... disc-shaped caps\" is a perfect representation of the large flora.\n*   The various creatures are also described accurately: the \"school of small, dark, fish-like creatures with glowing purple and green outlines,\" the \"very large, dark, whale-like creature,\" and the smaller \"glowing blue, ribbon-like creatures and floating pink rings.\"\n*   The first-person elements, such as the \"dark red border of a helmet or viewport\" and the \"gloved hands in an orange and black suit,\" are also correctly identified.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive, capturing all the salient subjects and their key visual attributes without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. It successfully paints a full picture of the complex environment, including the main structures, the various forms of life, and the first-person viewpoint elements. It also correctly notes the occasional appearance of the hands, fulfilling the instruction to describe subjects that appear or disappear.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the given rules exceptionally well:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text (other than the natural \"This video shows...\").\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is clear, simple, and informative. It avoids jargon and subjective emotional adjectives.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"structures,\" \"creatures,\" \"hands\") and appropriately uses qualifiers like \"trunk-like,\" \"fish-like,\" and \"whale-like\" to describe ambiguous subjects based on their appearance, which is an excellent way to adhere to the \"describe what is visible\" rule.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific details about color, shape, texture (\"porous texture,\" \"honeycomb-like texture\"), and luminosity (\"glowing green,\" \"glowing purple and green outlines\").\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It logically organizes the description, starting with the dominant environmental features, then moving to the different groups of creatures in order of size/prominence, and finishing with the first-person elements.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids \"image\" and \"frame.\" The use of \"background\" is justified as it is necessary to describe the location of the whale-like creature relative to the other subjects, which is permitted by the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is descriptive, accurate, and well-structured, providing a thorough and clear overview of the video's content.",
