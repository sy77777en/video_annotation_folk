    "pre_caption": "A group of several young adults, seen from behind, walks down a long, narrow tunnel. In the center is a man with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers. To his left is another man in a dark hoodie worn over a red t-shirt and dark pants. To the right of the central man is a woman in a dark top and pants, and further to the right is a man wearing a light-colored t-shirt and dark pants. A woman with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark checkered crop top and dark pants with a grommeted belt, is also visible on the left side of the group. All individuals are walking away from the camera toward a bright light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good inventory of the subjects and their clothing, but it could better capture the overall visual dynamic and atmosphere of the video. The description of the group walking in \"two rows\" feels too rigid; in the video, the group's formation is more fluid and casual, with individuals occasionally shifting positions. The caption also misses the prominent visual effect of the \"bright light at the end of the tunnel,\" which creates strong backlighting and renders the individuals closest to the camera as near-silhouettes, with details only becoming clearer on those further back or when the tunnel's sparse overhead lighting catches them. The phrase \"more people gradually appearing\" is vague; the video actually shows the camera slowly pulling back, revealing that the group is larger than initially perceived. Furthermore, the description of the woman in the checkered crop top feels tacked on. It would be more accurate to integrate her description by noting her position relative to the others, for instance, walking slightly behind the man in the black shirt on the left. A more effective caption would first establish the scene of the backlit group in the concrete tunnel and then describe the most visible individuals as a cohesive, loosely formed group, rather than a static, two-row formation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A loosely formed group of young adults walks down a long, narrow tunnel, their figures silhouetted against a bright light at the tunnel's end. The backlighting creates a striking visual effect, with details emerging only when the sparse overhead lights catch them. At the center is a man with short dark hair, wearing a black short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers. To his left, a man in a dark hoodie over a red t-shirt and dark pants moves fluidly alongside him. On his right, a woman in a dark top and pants walks, while further to the right, a man in a light-colored t-shirt and dark pants is visible. Slightly behind the central man on the left, a woman with short, light-colored hair, wearing a dark checkered crop top and dark pants with a grommeted belt, is part of the group. As the camera slowly pulls back, more individuals are revealed, emphasizing the group's casual, dynamic movement toward the light.",
