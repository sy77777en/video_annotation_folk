The selected golf club is atypical, appearing as a \"SHOVEL\" and labeled a \"DIGGING WEDGE.\" The golf ball is also in an unusual state, described as \"PLUGGED\" with a \"3Y RANGE,\" indicating it is embedded in the sand.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the pixel-art style and the quirky elements of the golf game, such as the \"SHOVEL\" club and the \"PLUGGED\" ball. However, it primarily describes a static moment, stating the player \"prepares to take a shot,\" whereas the video likely shows the full action. The feedback could be strengthened by describing the character's swing animation—perhaps an unconventional digging or scooping motion with the shovel—and the resulting ball trajectory as it is dislodged from the sand. The caption mentions UI text but overlooks other potential visual UI components that are crucial to the action, such as a power meter that charges up before the swing or a dotted line indicating the shot's path. Additionally, while the character's hair and shirt are noted, the description could be more vivid by including their specific pose over the ball and other visible details like the color of their shorts or shoes, which would be distinct in a pixel art style. The mention of the second player character in the UI could also be clarified by describing if it's a static portrait or an animated icon.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a vibrant pixelated golf game set on a small, sandy island surrounded by water, a player character with brown hair, a green shirt, and blue shorts stands poised over the ball, ready to swing. The character's pose is dynamic, with a shovel-like \"DIGGING WEDGE\" in hand, preparing for an unconventional scooping motion. As the swing animation unfolds, the power meter charges up, and a dotted line indicates the shot's path, showing the ball's trajectory as it is dislodged from its \"PLUGGED\" state in the sand with a \"3Y RANGE.\" The user interface features a static portrait of another player character with green hair and a green hat, adding to the quirky charm. The island course is unique, with a small green, four palm trees, and several bushes, enhancing the whimsical atmosphere of this unusual golf adventure.",
