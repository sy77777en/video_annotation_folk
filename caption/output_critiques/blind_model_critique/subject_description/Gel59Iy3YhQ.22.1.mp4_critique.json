    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that successfully adheres to all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a \"pixelated golf game\" and precisely describes the visual elements present. The details about the club being a \"SHOVEL\" labeled \"DIGGING WEDGE\" and the ball being \"PLUGGED\" are specific, objective observations likely taken directly from text within the video's user interface, which counts as a visual attribute.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers all the salient subjects: the main player character, the secondary character in the UI, the key objects (club and ball), and the environmental elements (island, trees, green). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear and comprehensive mental image of the scene without being overly long.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph that efficiently communicates the key visual information.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames or the passage of time.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types like \"player character,\" \"golf club,\" and \"palm trees.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives that convey emotion. While it uses \"atypical\" and \"unconventional,\" these are used appropriately to describe the factual, unusual nature of the game's mechanics (a shovel as a club) rather than expressing an opinion or feeling.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific visual attributes for the subjects, such as the main character's \"brown hair and a green shirt\" and the other character's \"green hair and a green hat.\"\n*   **Focus on Unusual States:** The caption excels at following the instruction to note objects in an unusual state, perfectly highlighting the \"SHOVEL\" club and the \"PLUGGED\" ball.\n*   **Clarity with Multiple Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the main player, the UI player, and the objects by describing their appearance and location/context. The order of description is logical, starting with the main character and their immediate situation before moving to secondary elements.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is clear, detailed, objective, and well-structured, successfully translating the visual information from the video into a concise text description.",
