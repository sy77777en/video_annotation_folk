    "pre_caption": "The video opens on an extreme, out-of-focus close-up of a person's ear and the side of their head, which has dark hair, with a textured, golden object visible near the earlobe. The scene then resolves to show a line of men in profile, facing to the right. These men, appearing to be soldiers in ceremonial dress, wear tall, black, furry hats. A prominent, gold-colored, braided chain-link strap is fastened under each man's chin. They have fair skin and are clean-shaven, maintaining neutral expressions while standing at attention. A portion of their uniform is visible, showing a high white collar and a red tunic.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is as follows: The description of the transition as the scene \"resolving\" is slightly vague; specifying the type of transition, such as a slow rack focus that pulls from the extreme close-up to the medium shot of the line, would provide a clearer picture of the visual flow. The caption describes the golden chinstrap in the opening shot and then describes it again in more detail for the group, which is redundant. It would be more efficient to introduce it in the close-up and then simply note that all the men wear the same strap. Furthermore, the description of a \"line of men\" lacks a sense of scale; clarifying whether the line extends beyond the frame would better convey the impression of a larger military formation. The initial subject is identified as \"a person,\" but it could be more directly linked to the subsequent reveal by stating that the opening is a close-up on one of the soldiers. Finally, while the uniform is correctly identified, the description could be more visually specific; for instance, describing the hats as \"tall, cylindrical, black bearskin hats\" offers more detail than \"tall, black, furry hats\" and grounds the description more firmly in visual evidence rather than assumed knowledge.",
