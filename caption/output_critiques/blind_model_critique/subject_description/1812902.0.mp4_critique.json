    "pre_caption": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures an expansive view of the ocean surrounding a large, fortress-like structure perched on a rocky outcrop. The focus is on the vastness of the sea and the imposing architecture, emphasizing the interaction between the natural and built environments. The water's deep blue contrasts with the structure's earthy tones, highlighting the scale and atmosphere rather than a specific object. The scene conveys a sense of isolation and grandeur, with the ocean's expanse and the fortress's detailed design as key visual elements.",

Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy and Completeness:**\n*   The caption is likely accurate in its basic description of the video's content: a seascape featuring a fortress-like structure on a rocky outcrop. It correctly identifies the main components of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption violates the following critical rules:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several subjective and interpretative words:\n    *   **\"imposing architecture\"**: \"Imposing\" is a subjective judgment of the structure's effect on the viewer.\n    *   **\"sense of isolation and grandeur\"**: These are emotional and atmospheric interpretations, not objective visual descriptions.\n    *   **\"key visual elements\"**: This is an analytical comment, not a description.\n\n2.  **Inclusion of Meta-Commentary and Analysis:** The caption describes the video's intent and composition rather than simply its visual content. The instructions require a direct description of the subjects. The caption includes phrases like:\n    *   \"It captures an expansive view...\"\n    *   \"The focus is on...\"\n    *   \"...emphasizing the interaction between the natural and built environments.\"\n    *   \"...highlighting the scale and atmosphere...\"\n    *   \"The scene conveys a sense of...\"\n    These phrases analyze the shot's purpose and effect, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n3.  **Incorrect Length and Structure for a Scenery Shot:** The instruction for scenery shots states to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot\" and \"briefly explain why there is no main subject... using one to three sentences.\" The provided caption is five sentences long and goes into excessive analytical detail, far exceeding the concise requirement.\n\n**What the Caption Did Correctly:**\n*   It correctly identifies the video as a \"seascape scenery shot.\"\n*   It uses precise terms for the subjects (\"ocean,\" \"fortress-like structure,\" \"rocky outcrop\").\n*   It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   It provides some objective visual attributes (\"deep blue\" water, \"earthy tones\" of the structure).\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the scene's components, it fails by being overly analytical, subjective, and verbose. It reads more like a critique or an artistic interpretation than the objective, factual description required by the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a seascape with a large structure resembling a fortress on a rocky outcrop surrounded by the ocean. The water is deep blue, and the structure has earthy tones. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the interaction between the sea and the structure.",
