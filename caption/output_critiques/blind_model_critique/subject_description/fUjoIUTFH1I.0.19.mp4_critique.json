    "pre_caption": "This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting a quiet, wet street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans. On the left, a large, white, lifted pickup truck is parked in the foreground, followed by a line of other cars, including a black sports car. The buildings feature characteristic wrought-iron balconies with hanging plants, while on the right, flags hang from poles along a covered sidewalk. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is on capturing the unique architectural environment and the quiet, atmospheric quality of the overcast, foggy scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption correctly identifies the primary subjects and the setting, but it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The description of the police car's lights as \"flashing near its headlights\" is a strong, specific detail. However, the caption includes subjective interpretations such as the street being \"quiet\" and the pedestrian \"adding life to the scene,\" which should be avoided. The term \"quiet\" is also potentially contradicted by the presence of a police car with active lights, which implies an event. Furthermore, the pedestrian is mentioned but not described with any visual attributes; for instance, the video might show a man in a black trench coat and a fedora walking away from the camera. The phrase \"a line of other cars\" is too vague; it would be better to either describe another specific, visible car or omit the mention if they are indistinct in the fog. The description should be revised to present only objective visual facts, providing specific details for the pedestrian's appearance and removing interpretive phrases to create a more direct and factual account of the scene.",
