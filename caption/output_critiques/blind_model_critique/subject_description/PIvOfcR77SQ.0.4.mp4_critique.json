    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is very good, but it has one specific flaw regarding the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key elements of the scene: a snowy rural landscape, a snow-covered field, falling snow, white yurts with conical roofs, a red wooden house, smaller sheds, and a distant forest under a gray sky. The description of the objects' attributes (colors, shapes, materials) is precise.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the entire scene from foreground to background, includes the weather conditions, and successfully paints a full picture of the environment without needing to reference specific moments in time.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and perfectly follows the instruction to explain *why* there is no main subject: \"The video lacks a single main subject, as the focus is on the expansive, wintry environment and the atmosphere...\".\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is clear, and the description is well-structured, moving logically from the foreground to the background.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"yurts,\" \"wooden house,\" and \"evergreen trees\" instead of vague words.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The main issue is the violation of the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses several such words:\n        *   \"**tranquil**\"\n        *   \"**quiet isolation**\"\n        *   \"**serene**\"\n        *   \"**cold winter tableau**\" (\"Cold\" is borderline, as it can be factual, but in this context, combined with \"tableau,\" it contributes to an emotional tone.)\n\nThese words describe the mood and feeling of the scene, which the instructions explicitly forbid. To be fully compliant, the caption should have described the scene using only objective, factual language.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its structure, accuracy, and adherence to most of the complex rules. However, its use of subjective, emotional adjectives (\"tranquil,\" \"serene,\" \"quiet isolation\") is a direct violation of a key instruction. If those words were replaced with more neutral, descriptive language, the caption would be perfect.",
