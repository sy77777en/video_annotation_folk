    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good, but it has one clear violation of the instructions and a minor stylistic point that could be improved.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a cityscape in Venice, featuring a wet cobblestone promenade, a large body of water, historic buildings, and an overcast, foggy sky. The description of the lamppost as \"dark green\" with \"pink-tinted glass\" is also precise and correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by identifying the shot type and explaining why there is no main subject. It provides a comprehensive overview of the environment, including the weather, the time of day (implied by the lit lamppost and dim light), and the key architectural and structural elements.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph, as instructed.\n    *   It correctly avoids using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It accurately identifies the scene as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and correctly explains the lack of a main subject, adhering perfectly to the rule for such videos.\n    *   It uses precise, descriptive language for objects and their attributes (e.g., \"wide, wet cobblestone promenade,\" \"weathered facades,\" \"dark green lamppost\").\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Subjective Adjectives\":** The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the word **\"moody\"** to describe the atmosphere. This is a subjective term that conveys an emotion or feeling and should have been omitted. A more objective description could focus on the visual effects, such as \"the dim light and fog create a soft focus on distant elements.\"\n    *   **Minor Stylistic Issue:** The caption begins with \"This is a cityscape scenery shot depicting...\" While this directly follows the instruction to \"specify the type of scenery shot,\" it reads more like an analysis of the video rather than a natural description. A more fluid phrasing would be to integrate this information, for example: \"In a cityscape scenery shot, a wide, wet cobblestone promenade runs alongside a large body of water in Venice.\" This is a minor point, as the current phrasing is a valid interpretation of the rules, but it could be more elegant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent and follows the vast majority of the complex instructions very well. Its primary failure is the use of the subjective adjective \"moody,\" which directly violates a key negative constraint. Removing that single word would make the caption almost perfect.",
