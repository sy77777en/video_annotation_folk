    "pre_caption": "The video features a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text, floating over a snow-covered landscape.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The drone shot begins with a wide view of a hot air balloon. As the drone approaches, the balloon's top gradually fills the frame until only the top is visible. After crossing over the balloon, the view transitions to a snow-covered ground, eventually revealing white subtitle text in the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"hot air balloon\" and accurately describes its key visual attributes: \"colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text.\" It also correctly describes the setting as a \"snow-covered landscape\" with \"scattered trees\" and notes the appearance of \"white subtitle text.\" The description of the camera movement and the shift in focus from the balloon to an \"overhead view of the snowy terrain\" is also a precise representation of the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is comprehensive, capturing all the essential elements and the narrative flow of the video. It describes the primary subject (the balloon), the environment (the snowy landscape), a secondary element (the text), and the key action (the camera movement and transition). No significant visual information is omitted.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully follows the specific rules laid out in the instructions:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet provides a clear and detailed picture of the video's content.\n*   **Single Coherent Paragraph:** It is formatted correctly as one paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** It focuses on describing the subjects (\"hot air balloon,\" \"trees,\" \"text\") and their specific visual characteristics.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" within the description itself (though \"video\" is used in the introductory phrase, which is acceptable).\n*   **No Subjectivity:** It uses objective, descriptive language (\"colorful,\" \"red, white, and blue\") rather than emotional or subjective adjectives (\"beautiful,\" \"amazing\").\n*   **Describes Transitions:** It effectively explains the transition in the video, noting how the focus shifts from the balloon to an overhead view of the ground. It also correctly notes the appearance of the subtitle text.\n*   **Prioritization:** It correctly prioritizes the most salient subject, the hot air balloon, before describing the landscape and the text that appears later.\n*   **Use of Motion/Background:** It mentions the background (\"snow-covered landscape\") and motion (\"floating,\" \"moves closer\") appropriately, as this context is essential for understanding the action and the relationship between the subjects.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and structured perfectly according to the rules.",
