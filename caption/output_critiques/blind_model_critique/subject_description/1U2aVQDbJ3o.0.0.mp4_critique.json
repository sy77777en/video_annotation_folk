    "pre_caption": "The video features a hot air balloon with a colorful design, including red, white, and blue vertical stripes and visible text, floating over a snow-covered landscape. As the drone moves closer, the balloon's top becomes the primary focus, eventually transitioning to an overhead view of the snowy terrain below.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The drone shot begins with a wide view of a hot air balloon. As the drone approaches, the balloon's top gradually fills the frame until only the top is visible. After crossing over the balloon, the view transitions to a snow-covered ground, eventually revealing white subtitle text in the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and the sequence of events, but it could be improved by adding more specific visual details and refining the description of the camera's movement. For instance, the description of the hot air balloon could include its teardrop shape, the wicker basket suspended below, and the intermittent bursts of flame from the burner, which would be visible in the initial shots. The \"visible text\" could be more specifically described, such as \"the word 'EXPLORE' in bold, black letters.\" The transition is described as the drone \"moving closer\" and then \"transitioning,\" which is vague. A more precise description would be that the camera ascends past the balloon, tilting downwards to create a seamless transition from a side profile to a direct bird's-eye view, rather than a hard cut. The description of the snowy terrain is generic; it could be enhanced by mentioning details like the long, dark shadows cast by the trees, suggesting the low sun of early morning or late afternoon, or the pristine, untouched texture of the snow, which would emphasize the remote nature of the landscape. Finally, the mention of the subtitle feels a bit detached; it could be integrated more smoothly by stating the location as a fact revealed by the text, such as, \"revealing a bird's-eye view of the snowy terrain of Lapland, Finland, as identified by on-screen text.\"",
