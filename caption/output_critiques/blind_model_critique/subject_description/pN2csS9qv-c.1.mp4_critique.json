    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of female gymnasts celebrating near gymnastics equipment. They are wearing matching red leotards with sheer black sleeves and rhinestone embellishments. Their hair is styled in buns, and one gymnast has a red bow. The women are engaged in a joyful interaction, clapping and high-fiving each other. A woman in black athletic wear, possibly a coach or team member, is also visible, joining in the celebration with raised hands. The setting appears to be an indoor sports venue, indicated by the presence of gymnastic apparatus and a banner in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good in its descriptive quality but fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions. It successfully identifies the subjects and their visual attributes but includes subjective language, speculation, and unnecessary background details.\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption appears to be highly accurate. The description of \"female gymnasts,\" \"matching red leotards with sheer black sleeves and rhinestone embellishments,\" \"hair styled in buns,\" and actions like \"clapping and high-fiving\" are all specific, plausible, and paint a clear picture of a post-routine celebration at a gymnastics event.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It identifies the primary group of subjects (gymnasts) and a secondary subject (woman in black). It details their clothing, hairstyles, and actions, and it successfully distinguishes individuals within the group (e.g., \"one gymnast has a red bow\").\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption has several significant issues.\n\n*   **VIOLATION - Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the phrase **\"joyful interaction,\"** which is a direct violation. It should describe the objective actions (clapping, high-fiving) without assigning an emotion to them.\n*   **VIOLATION - Describing the Uncertain:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption speculates on the role of the woman in black by stating she is **\"possibly a coach or team member.\"** This is an assumption, not a visual fact, and should have been omitted.\n*   **VIOLATION - Unnecessary Background Description:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The final sentence, **\"The setting appears to be an indoor sports venue, indicated by the presence of gymnastic apparatus and a banner in the background,\"** is a clear violation. The background is described for context, not to differentiate the main subjects from one another. Mentioning the equipment is only acceptable in relation to the subjects' position (e.g., \"near gymnastics equipment\").\n*   **Minor Violation - Introductory Text:** The instruction asks to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption begins with **\"The video features...\"** which is a form of introductory text. A better caption would start directly with the subject description.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is a version of the caption that adheres strictly to all the instructions:\n\nA group of female gymnasts wearing matching red leotards with sheer black sleeves and rhinestone embellishments are gathered near gymnastics equipment. Their hair is styled in buns, and one gymnast has a red bow. The women clap and high-five each other. A woman in black athletic wear is also present, standing with her hands raised.",
