    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot of a tranquil, snow-covered forest at night. A tall, slender pine tree stands as a central focal point, its dark green needles lightly dusted with snow, anchoring the composition against a backdrop of a dense evergreen forest. The ground is covered in a thick, pristine blanket of white snow. Above, the dark, star-filled sky is dramatically illuminated by the vibrant green glow of the aurora borealis, which swirls and dances in wide bands behind wispy clouds. There is no single main subject; instead, the focus is on capturing the breathtaking atmosphere and the majestic scale of the natural world, where the celestial light show and the serene winter landscape combine to create a powerful environmental portrait.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main components of the scene, it misses key visual interactions and contains contradictions regarding the instructions. The use of subjective adjectives like \"tranquil,\" \"breathtaking,\" and \"powerful\" violates the rule to avoid emotional language. Furthermore, the caption is inconsistent, claiming there is \"no single main subject\" immediately after describing the pine tree as a \"central focal point\" and the aurora as a dynamic element. The video clearly presents the aurora and the tree as primary subjects. The description also fails to mention the significant interplay of light; the \"vibrant green glow\" of the aurora would cast a noticeable green tint upon the \"pristine blanket of white snow\" and create long, dark shadows from the trees, details that are visually prominent but absent from the text. The description of the aurora's movement as \"swirls and dances\" is too generic; a more precise account, such as \"slowly shifting curtains of light\" or \"rapidly flickering vertical columns,\" would better reflect the specific motion visible. Lastly, the final sentence explaining the lack of a main subject feels tacked on and is inaccurate given the salience of the aurora and the central tree. The caption should be revised to objectively describe the scene, commit to identifying the primary subjects, and incorporate the crucial details of light and shadow that define the environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a snow-covered forest at night, featuring a tall, slender pine tree as a central focal point. The tree's dark green needles are lightly dusted with snow, standing out against a dense evergreen backdrop. The ground is blanketed in thick, white snow, which is tinted green by the vibrant glow of the aurora borealis. The aurora creates long, dark shadows from the trees and moves in slowly shifting curtains of light across the star-filled sky. This interplay of light and shadow highlights the aurora and the tree as primary subjects, emphasizing the dynamic and serene atmosphere of the winter landscape.",
