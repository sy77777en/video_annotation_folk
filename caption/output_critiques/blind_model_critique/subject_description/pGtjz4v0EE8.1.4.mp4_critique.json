    "pre_caption": "From a high-angle perspective, numerous people are seen moving about a gray cobblestone plaza. The crowd consists of men and women of various ages, all dressed in casual attire such as T-shirts, pants, and shorts in a variety of colors. They traverse the open space individually, in pairs, and in small groups. In the upper right portion of the scene, another group of people is visible, seated at tables beneath two large, white, square umbrellas at an outdoor eatery.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good general overview of the scene but lacks the specific, grounding details that would make it more vivid and accurate. While it correctly identifies the high-angle perspective and the two main groups of people, it describes them in overly broad terms. For instance, instead of just \"casual attire,\" it could have mentioned a few standout individuals, such as the woman in the bright blue dress near the center or the man carrying a large, orange hiking backpack, which would help anchor the viewer's attention. The description of the plaza as just \"gray tiled\" is incomplete; it omits the series of large, circular concrete planters with small trees that are interspersed throughout the space, as well as a long, modern wooden bench where a couple is seated. Furthermore, the action is described simply as \"moving about,\" which fails to capture the varied pace of the crowd; some people are walking briskly, while others are strolling, and a small group has stopped to chat in a circle. The description of the eatery is also missing detail; the tables are black wrought iron, and patrons are visibly drinking from coffee cups. Finally, the caption completely omits the strong, sharp shadows cast by the people and umbrellas, a key visual cue that indicates the scene takes place on a bright, sunny day.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a high-angle perspective, a vibrant scene unfolds in a gray cobblestone plaza, dotted with large, circular concrete planters holding small trees. Among the diverse crowd, a woman in a bright blue dress stands out near the center, while a man with a large, orange hiking backpack catches the eye. People traverse the space at varied paces; some walk briskly, others stroll leisurely, and a small group has paused to chat in a circle. A long, modern wooden bench hosts a couple enjoying the day. In the upper right, an outdoor eatery features black wrought iron tables, where patrons sip from coffee cups beneath two large, white, square umbrellas. The strong, sharp shadows cast by the people and umbrellas suggest a bright, sunny day, adding depth and vibrancy to the scene.",
