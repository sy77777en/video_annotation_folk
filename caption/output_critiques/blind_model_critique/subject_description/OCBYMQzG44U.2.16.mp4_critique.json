    "pre_caption": "This architectural scenery shot captures a surreal, flooded interior, creating a liminal and unsettling atmosphere. A long, white hall with a curved ceiling is illuminated by rows of square lights, casting a greenish, hazy glow over the dark, murky water that fills the space. The camera is positioned at water level, emphasizing the ripples and reflections as the view extends towards a raised platform and a tall doorway in the distance. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is intentionally placed on the strange and expansive environment. The scale of the architecture and the mysterious quality of the water are used to evoke a specific mood rather than to draw attention to any single object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a flooded architectural space and captures its general atmosphere, it relies too heavily on subjective and interpretive language such as 'surreal,' 'liminal,' and 'unsettling,' which should be avoided in favor of objective description. The description of the hall is somewhat generic; for instance, it fails to mention that the white walls are composed of large, seamless panels that contribute to the monolithic feel, and it omits the detail that the square lights on the curved ceiling occasionally flicker. More importantly, the caption misses a critical, though subtle, subject. While it correctly notes the distant platform and doorway, it completely overlooks the small, silhouetted figure that briefly stands in the doorway towards the end of the video before stepping back into the darkness, a detail that fundamentally changes the nature of the scene from pure scenery to one with a mysterious occupant. Finally, the concluding sentences, which explain *why* there is no main subject, are an unnecessary interpretation of artistic intent; the description should focus solely on what is visible, allowing the vastness of the space and the distant, fleeting figure to speak for themselves.",
