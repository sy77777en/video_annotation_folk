    "pre_caption": "A person with a light skin tone is shown from the back, walking away from the camera. They are wearing a dark blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt over a longer, patterned tunic with a curved hem. The tunic has an abstract pattern in shades of grey, black, and white. The individual is also wearing black leggings. Their arms are held down at their sides as they walk.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a casual indoor scene, initially out of focus. A person wearing a blue top and black leggings enters from the right with their back turned, with only their hips, hands, and part of their arms visible. As they walk away from the camera and go out of focus, more of their midsection becomes visible, though it remains roughly a medium shot.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes only what is visually present without making assumptions. For example, it correctly identifies the subject as a \"person\" rather than guessing a gender, which is appropriate since they are seen from the back. It precisely describes the clothing as layered (sweatshirt over a tunic) and details the colors and abstract pattern, which demonstrates careful observation.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete and provides a rich visual summary. It covers all the key attributes requested:\n*   **Subject Type:** \"person\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** \"light skin tone,\" \"dark blue, long-sleeved sweatshirt,\" \"patterned tunic with a curved hem,\" \"abstract pattern in shades of grey, black, and white,\" \"black leggings.\"\n*   **Pose and Action:** \"shown from the back, walking away from the camera,\" \"arms are held down at their sides.\"\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption perfectly follows all the specific rules outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It efficiently packs a lot of detail into a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The entire description is dedicated to the single person in the video, avoiding any mention of the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** It refrains from describing anything that isn't visible or certain (e.g., facial expression, age, ethnicity).\n*   **Simple and Natural English:** The language is clear, objective, and easy to understand.\n*   **No Subjective Adjectives:** It uses descriptive words (\"dark blue,\" \"long-sleeved\") rather than emotional or opinion-based ones (\"nice,\" \"stylish\").\n*   **Correct Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, objective, detailed, and well-structured, providing a clear and thorough description of the video's subject.",
