    "pre_caption": "This video presents a cityscape scenery shot, focusing on the architectural grandeur of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The camera slowly tilts upwards, showcasing the historic red-brick building with its white-trimmed windows, central clock tower, and a statue in the foreground, all set against a backdrop of modern skyscrapers and a clear sky. An American flag flies to the left of the building. There is no single main subject, as the shot aims to capture the overall environment and atmosphere, emphasizing the scale of the landmark and its place within the urban landscape, rather than a specific object or individual. The manicured green lawn in the immediate foreground and the symmetrical arcades flanking the main structure contribute to the sense of place and historical significance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity, conciseness, and the correct application of the rules for describing subjects.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption accurately describes the visual components of the video: a red-brick building with a clock tower, a statue, a flag, a lawn, and skyscrapers, as well as the upward tilting camera motion.\n*   **Inaccurate Premise:** The statement, \"There is no single main subject,\" is incorrect. The video, as described, clearly focuses on Independence Hall. A large, centered, and detailed building is a salient subject. The caption misinterprets the instruction for scenery shots, which is meant for videos without any clear focal point (e.g., a wide, empty landscape).\n*   **Potential Speculation:** Identifying the building as \"Independence Hall in Philadelphia\" may violate the rule \"avoid describing what is not visible.\" Unless the name is explicitly shown in the video, this is an assumption based on external knowledge.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The caption is fairly complete in listing the visible elements. It covers the main building, its immediate surroundings (lawn, statue, flag), and the background (sky, skyscrapers).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several core instructions:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Language:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several:\n    *   \"architectural **grandeur**\"\n    *   \"**historic** red-brick building\"\n    *   \"**manicured** green lawn\"\n    *   \"contribute to the sense of place and **historical significance**\"\n    These are interpretations of the scene, not objective descriptions of visual attributes.\n\n2.  **Misapplication of Scenery Shot Rule:** The caption incorrectly applies the rule for scenery shots. It should have identified the building as the main subject and described it in detail, as per the instructions for videos with \"salient human or non-human subjects.\" Instead, it contradicts itself by focusing on the building and then claiming it isn't a main subject.\n\n3.  **Lack of Conciseness:** The instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative description.\" The caption is unnecessarily long, largely due to the flawed and lengthy explanation of why there is supposedly no main subject. The final sentence about \"sense of place\" is also superfluous and interpretive.\n\n4.  **Introductory Text:** While minor, the phrase \"This video presents...\" is a form of introductory text that could be omitted for greater conciseness and directness.\n\nIn summary, the caption is not good because it is built on a flawed premise (that there is no main subject), uses prohibited subjective language, and is not as concise as it should be. It fails to follow the logic of the instructions provided.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures Independence Hall in Philadelphia, focusing on its red-brick facade, white-trimmed windows, and central clock tower. The camera tilts upwards, revealing a statue in the foreground, an American flag to the left, and modern skyscrapers in the background against a clear sky. A green lawn and symmetrical arcades frame the historic building, highlighting its prominence within the urban landscape.",
