    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a narrow urban street scene with several parked cars and a few people walking along the sidewalk. The street is lined with multi-story buildings featuring a mix of red and beige brick facades. Two cars, one black and one gray, are parked along the street. A man in a white shirt is visible on the left side, standing near the black car. Another person, partially obscured, is walking further down the street. The overall atmosphere is urban and slightly overcast, with the buildings and cars being the primary focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback is based on the following imagined video content:\nA static, wide shot of a city street on a gray, overcast day. The camera is positioned across the street. On the right side of the frame, a black sedan is parked at the curb. A man in a white t-shirt, blue jeans, and with short brown hair walks from behind the sedan and moves briskly to the left, exiting the frame about halfway through the video. Further down the sidewalk, a woman in a tan trench coat walks slowly from right to left, partially obscured by a street sign for part of her walk. Behind the black sedan is a silver SUV, and further down the street on the left, a red hatchback is parked. The buildings are a mix of older, 3-4 story brick apartment buildings in shades of red and brown. A few thin, leafless trees are planted in squares on the concrete sidewalk.\n\n***\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the general urban setting, it lacks specificity and misrepresents the focus of the scene. The description of the people is too vague; the \"man in a white shirt\" could be more accurately described as wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans, and the \"partially obscured\" person is clearly a woman in a tan trench coat walking further in the background. The caption incorrectly designates this as a \"scenery shot\" with buildings and cars as the primary focus, whereas the movement of the two people makes them the most salient subjects. The description of the vehicles is also incomplete, as it mentions the black car but omits the silver SUV parked behind it and the red hatchback visible further down the street. Finally, the caption misses key environmental details like the leafless trees lining the sidewalk, which contribute to the scene's character. The description should be restructured to prioritize the moving subjects, provide more detailed attributes for all subjects, and offer a more accurate hierarchy of visual importance.",
