    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide, aerial scenery shot of a sprawling airport complex at night, with the focus on the vast scale and intricate layout of the infrastructure rather than a specific subject. The dark landscape is illuminated by a complex grid of glowing green and white lights that delineate the multiple intersecting runways and taxiways. In the lower right portion of the frame, a large, brightly lit circular terminal building is visible, with several concourses extending from it. A white text overlay in the center of the image reads \"July 7, 2017\".",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the content as a wide, aerial scenery shot of an airport at night, but it describes the scene as if it were a static photograph, missing key dynamic elements visible in the video. It fails to mention the slow, deliberate movement of several airplanes, their navigation lights blinking, as they taxi along the green-lit pathways or the faint sight of a plane landing on a distant runway. The description also omits the numerous small ground service vehicles and baggage carts that can be seen moving around the brightly lit terminal area, adding a layer of activity to the scene. While the terminal is mentioned, the caption neglects to include the dozens of large passenger aircraft from various airlines that are clearly visible docked at the gates along the concourses. Furthermore, the description of the lighting is incomplete; in addition to the green and white lights, distinct blue lights are visible lining the edges of the taxiways. The caption also incorrectly states the text overlay is in the center; the white text \"July 7, 2017\" is actually positioned in the lower-left corner. Lastly, the description violates the negative constraint by using the terms \"frame\" and \"image.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dynamic aerial view of a sprawling airport complex at night, highlighting the vast scale and intricate layout of the infrastructure. The scene is alive with activity, as several airplanes move slowly and deliberately along the green-lit taxiways, their navigation lights blinking. In the distance, a faint glimpse of a plane landing on a runway adds to the dynamic nature of the scene. Numerous small ground service vehicles and baggage carts bustle around the brightly lit terminal area, enhancing the sense of movement. The large circular terminal building is prominently visible in the lower right, with several concourses extending from it, where dozens of large passenger aircraft from various airlines are docked at the gates. The airport is illuminated by a complex grid of glowing green, white, and distinct blue lights lining the edges of the taxiways. A white text overlay reading \"July 7, 2017\" is positioned in the lower-left corner of the video.",
