    "pre_caption": "A person is positioned on a metal fire escape, their figure largely in shadow but with some areas illuminated. This individual wears a red and white mask, characterized by clown-like features including red hair-like elements, and is dressed in dark, indistinct clothing that appears to be a shirt and pants. The person holds a rifle in a two-handed grip, with the barrel pointed upwards and slightly to one side, and the stock positioned near their shoulder.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subject and the central action, it could be improved with more specific details and refined phrasing. The term \"person\" is appropriately neutral, but if the subject's build is clearly masculine, \"man\" would be more precise. The description of the lighting as creating shadows and illumination is good, but it could be enhanced by describing the quality of the light itself—for instance, if a single, harsh light from below is what carves the figure out of the darkness, mentioning this would add valuable context. The description of the weapon as a \"device resembling a rifle\" and its projectile as a \"jagged metal point\" is safe, but if the video clearly shows a grappling gun firing a multi-pronged hook, using these more specific terms would be more informative. The sentence structure describing the action is slightly awkward and violates the instruction to avoid temporal cues like \"At the start of the video\"; a more fluid description would be \"The individual raises the device to their shoulder and fires, launching a projectile that trails a rope.\" Finally, the \"clown-like features\" of the mask could be more vividly described by noting specific elements like a painted red smile or nose, if they are visible through the shadows.",
