    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In this video, the foreground shows the upper half of a person's head, positioned at the bottom center of the frame, turned sideways to the camera and out of focus. In the middle ground, another person is shown in a medium shot, facing the camera and in sharp focus, and then he walks out of the frame from the left.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent and detailed evaluation of the caption. Here is a breakdown of its performance based on the provided instructions:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good and captures the essence of the video well, but it fails on one critical instruction.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a man as the main subject and another out-of-focus person in the foreground.\n*   The descriptions of the subjects' appearances (dark wavy hair, beard, white t-shirt, dark jacket) and actions (looking down, turning, walking away) are precise and fact-based.\n*   It correctly notes the difference in focus between the two subjects, which is a key visual element.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It describes both subjects, their relative positions, their key visual attributes, and the primary action that occurs.\n*   It successfully synthesizes the entire video into a single, coherent narrative, describing the initial state and the man's subsequent departure.\n*   It correctly prioritizes the main subject by providing more detail about him, while keeping the description of the secondary, out-of-focus subject brief.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is efficient and packed with relevant detail.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes.\n    *   **No Speculation:** It sticks to what is visually verifiable.\n    *   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear and easy to understand.\n    *   **One Paragraph:** It is formatted correctly as a single paragraph.\n    *   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on clothing, hair, and actions.\n    *   **Clear Differentiation:** It clearly distinguishes between \"the out-of-focus... person\" and \"the main subject... a man.\"\n    *   **Describes Disappearance:** It correctly describes the man walking out of view, as instructed.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The caption violates the explicit negative constraint: **\"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\"** The caption uses the word \"frame\" three times: \"bottom of the frame,\" \"out of the frame,\" and \"out of the frame to the left.\" This is the most significant error in the caption.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nTo be fully compliant, the references to \"frame\" must be removed. Here is a revised version that adheres to all instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\nAt the bottom of the view, the out-of-focus upper half of a person's head with dark hair is visible, turned sideways. The main subject, positioned behind this person and in sharp focus, is a man shown from the chest up. He has dark, wavy hair, a beard, and is wearing a white t-shirt under a dark, unzipped jacket. He initially stands looking down toward the foreground person before turning and exiting to the left.",
