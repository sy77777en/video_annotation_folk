    "pre_caption": "The video features an elderly man and woman seated at a dining table in a restaurant. The man, wearing a maroon shirt with a pocket, has short gray hair and glasses. He is using chopsticks to eat from a plate of noodles and vegetables, with a glass of iced tea in front of him. The woman, wearing a yellow patterned blouse, also has glasses and short dark hair. She is holding chopsticks and appears to be engaged in conversation. The transition between the subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the man to the woman, highlighting their interaction during the meal.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption.\n\nThe caption is good but has a few key areas where it fails to adhere strictly to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Assumed Accuracy:** Without seeing the video, we must assume the visual details (maroon shirt, yellow patterned blouse, noodles, iced tea, etc.) are correct.\n*   **Inaccurate Description of Transition:** The final sentence describes the filmmaking technique (\"the focus shifts\") rather than the visual content of the shots. The instruction asks to \"describe the subject in each segment separately,\" not to provide a meta-commentary on the camera work.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Good Coverage:** The caption successfully identifies the two main subjects (man and woman) and describes their key attributes (clothing, hair, glasses) and actions (eating, holding chopsticks). It also includes relevant objects (food, drink, utensils).\n*   **Minor Omissions:** The instructions ask for details like skin tone and facial expression, which are not mentioned. While \"engaged in conversation\" implies an expression, it is an interpretation of an action rather than a direct description of facial features. The description of the man's food is specific (\"noodles and vegetables\"), but the woman's is not, which might be an omission if her food is also visible.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is the area with the most significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a good overview of the scene in a single paragraph.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It correctly uses \"man\" and \"woman.\"\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Describes Visual Attributes:** It details clothing, hair, and accessories as instructed.\n*   **Natural Language:** The language is simple and easy to understand.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere:**\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is a form of introductory text that the instructions explicitly say to avoid (\"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text\").\n*   **Describing the Transition:** The final sentence, \"The transition between the subjects occurs as the focus shifts from the man to the woman, highlighting their interaction during the meal,\" is the biggest violation.\n    *   It describes the *cinematic technique* (\"focus shifts\") instead of the *visual content* of the shots, which goes against the instruction to \"describe the subject in each segment separately.\"\n    *   The phrase \"highlighting their interaction\" is subjective and interpretive, explaining the *purpose* of the shot rather than its objective content. This violates the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" or interpretations.\n*   **Minor Subjectivity:** The phrase \"appears to be engaged in conversation\" is a slight inference. While a reasonable one, a more objective description might be \"She is holding chopsticks and looking toward the man.\"\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is a strong attempt and captures the essence of the scene well. However, it needs revision to fully comply with the rules. The primary flaw is its meta-commentary on the filmmaking process in the final sentence, instead of objectively describing the subjects as they appear in different parts of the video. Removing the introductory phrase and rewriting the final sentence to describe the content of the shots rather than the camera's action would make it fully compliant.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An elderly man and woman are seated at a dining table in a restaurant. The man, wearing a maroon shirt with a pocket, has short gray hair, glasses, and a light skin tone. He is using chopsticks to eat from a plate of noodles and vegetables, with a glass of iced tea in front of him. The woman, wearing a yellow patterned blouse, also has glasses, short dark hair, and a medium skin tone. She is holding chopsticks, looking toward the man, and appears to be smiling slightly. Both are engaged in their meal, with the focus alternating between them, capturing their interaction.",
