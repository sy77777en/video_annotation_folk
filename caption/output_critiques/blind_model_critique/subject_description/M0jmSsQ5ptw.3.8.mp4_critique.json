    "pre_caption": "The video features an outdoor experimental setup. On the right, a tall, freestanding structure is constructed from light-colored wooden planks, featuring a wide triangular base and a central vertical post with attached horizontal and diagonal braces. A small, black, spherical ball rolls down this wooden structure. To the left stands a large, rectangular object completely covered in a white, canvas-like fabric. Various pieces of equipment are attached to the side of this white structure, including a green pouch hanging from a carabiner near the top, a black pouch positioned lower down, and an assortment of black and yellow ropes and straps.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a wooden experimental setup in an outdoor setting. It focuses on part of the setup, with a ball rolling down from the top. On the left side of the frame, there’s an object covered with white fabric, and in the background on the right, mountains, fields, and the sky are visible.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but contains a few minor issues that prevent it from being perfect. It successfully follows most of the complex instructions, but it fails on two specific points.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the objects in the scene (a wooden structure, a ball, a fabric-covered object, pouches, ropes) and describes their key visual attributes (color, shape, material, and relative position) with precision. For example, describing the structure as having a \"wide triangular base and a central vertical post\" and noting the \"black and yellow ropes\" are all accurate visual details.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers all the salient subjects present in the scene without getting bogged down in unnecessary background detail. It describes the two main structures on the left and right, the moving ball, and the smaller pieces of equipment attached to the left-hand structure, providing a comprehensive overview of the scene's contents.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has minor flaws.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is clear, simple, and descriptive, forming a coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their visual attributes.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses specific terms like \"structure,\" \"ball,\" \"pouch,\" and \"carabiner\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing visual attributes, using phrases like \"light-colored wooden planks,\" \"white, canvas-like fabric,\" and \"small, black, spherical ball.\"\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively uses location (\"On the right,\" \"To the left\") to distinguish between the two main structures.\n*   **Use of Motion:** It correctly includes the ball's motion (\"rolls down\") because this action is a key, defining feature of the subject and its relationship to the structure.\n\n**What the caption does incorrectly:**\n1.  **Use of Introductory Text:** The instruction states, \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is an introductory phrase that should have been omitted. The description should start directly with the subjects, for example: \"On the right, a tall, freestanding structure...\"\n2.  **Subjective Interpretation:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The phrase \"an outdoor experimental setup\" is an interpretation of the scene's purpose, not a direct visual observation. While it is a very likely interpretation, it is still a subjective conclusion about the function of the objects rather than a description of what is seen.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good** because its core descriptive content is accurate, detailed, and well-structured according to the most important instructions. However, it is not perfect because it includes an unnecessary introductory phrase and a subjective interpretation, both of which are explicitly forbidden by the rules. To be fully compliant, it should have omitted the first five words (\"The video features an outdoor experimental setup.\") and started directly with the description of the objects.",
