    "pre_caption": "The video features several people and vehicles in an urban setting. On the left, a person with light skin, wearing a white helmet, a white long-sleeve top, and dark pants, is riding a bicycle. Multiple cars are visible, including a white compact car and a red taxi with a green emblem on its door. Additional people can be seen in the distance, though their features are not clearly discernible. The subjects are spread throughout the scene, with no single individual or vehicle as the main focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why it is a good caption:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the caption is highly accurate. It uses precise, verifiable details (\"white helmet,\" \"red taxi with a green emblem\") and responsibly avoids making assumptions about details that are not clear (\"person\" instead of \"man\" or \"woman,\" \"features are not clearly discernible\").\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption provides a complete overview of the scene as requested. It identifies the primary subject types (people, vehicles), describes the most prominent examples in detail, and acknowledges the presence of less distinct subjects in the background. It successfully paints a full picture without getting lost in excessive detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions meticulously:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the key subjects and their attributes in a brief paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The description is centered on the people and vehicles, not the background, adhering to the instruction to only mention the background (\"urban setting\") for context.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames or using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption uses simple, neutral language (e.g., \"light skin,\" \"white long-sleeve top\") and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses clear terms like \"person,\" \"bicycle,\" \"cars,\" and \"taxi.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details for the cyclist (skin tone, clothing, helmet) and the vehicles (color, type, markings).\n*   **Distinguishing Multiple Subjects:** It successfully distinguishes subjects using location (\"On the left\") and appearance (\"white compact car,\" \"red taxi\").\n*   **Handling of Focus:** The final sentence, \"The subjects are spread throughout the scene, with no single individual or vehicle as the main focus,\" is a perfect execution of the instruction for how to handle a video with multiple subjects and no clear focal point.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as required.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, concise, and objective, providing a description that is both useful and faithful to the rules. There are no significant flaws or areas for improvement.",
