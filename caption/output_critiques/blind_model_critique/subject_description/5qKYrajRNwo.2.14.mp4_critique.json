    "pre_caption": "The video features a young girl with long, dark braided hair and a light skin tone. She is wearing a dark blue dress and is engaged with a small, open chest.

The setting suggests an intimate, focused moment as she interacts with the object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few significant areas where it fails to adhere to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate in its description of the physical subjects and their attributes. It correctly identifies a \"young girl,\" her \"long, dark braided hair,\" \"light skin tone,\" and \"dark blue dress.\" It also accurately describes the objects she interacts with: a \"small, open chest\" and a \"golden pocket watch.\" The description of her action, \"examining it closely,\" is also a plausible and objective observation.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is quite complete, providing a good level of detail for the primary subject and the key objects. It successfully paints a clear picture by including details about the girl's appearance, clothing, and her interaction with the pocket watch. It effectively combines details from across the video's duration by noting the transition in her facial expression.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is where the caption has several issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Conciseness and Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"young girl,\" \"chest,\" and \"pocket watch.\"\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific visual attributes for the girl (hair, skin tone, dress) and the watch (golden).\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the action as a whole (\"transitions from... to...\") without referring to specific frames.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n1.  **Use of Subjective/Emotional Language:** The most significant violation is the use of words that describe emotions rather than physical expressions. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption describes her expression as transitioning from \"**curiosity** to a gentle smile, indicating **interest** and **satisfaction**.\" These are interpretations of her internal state. A compliant description would focus only on the physical changes, such as: \"Her facial expression changes from having wide eyes and a neutral mouth to the corners of her lips turning up in a gentle smile.\"\n2.  **Describing the Setting/Atmosphere:** The final sentence, \"The setting suggests an intimate, focused moment as she interacts with the object,\" violates the rule to \"**Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary...**\" and to avoid subjective descriptions. This sentence interprets the mood and atmosphere of the scene, which is not a direct visual description of a subject.\n3.  **Introductory Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\". While not as explicitly forbidden as \"image\" or \"frame,\" this phrasing is unnecessary and goes against the spirit of creating a direct and concise description. The caption should begin by describing the subject directly (e.g., \"A young girl with...\").\n\nIn summary, while the caption successfully describes the physical elements, it fails on the critical instructions to remain objective, avoid interpreting emotions, and refrain from describing the overall mood or setting.",
