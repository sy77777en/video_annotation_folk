    "pre_caption": "The video features a young girl with long, dark braided hair and a light skin tone. She is wearing a dark blue dress and is engaged with a small, open chest. In her hands, she holds a golden pocket watch, examining it closely. Her facial expression transitions from curiosity to a gentle smile, indicating interest and satisfaction. The setting suggests an intimate, focused moment as she interacts with the object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and her primary action, it lacks the specific visual detail required and includes subjective interpretations. For instance, \"a small, open chest\" and \"a golden pocket watch\" are too generic; the video likely shows a more distinct chest, perhaps a dark wood box with brass fittings, and the watch might have an ornate, engraved cover that is open, with a visible chain dangling from the girl's hand. The description of the girl could also be more precise; \"a dark blue dress\" could be a navy blue pinafore over a white, puffy-sleeved blouse, and \"long, dark braided hair\" could be a single, thick braid resting over her right shoulder. The caption violates the instruction to avoid subjective language by stating her smile \"indicat[es] interest and satisfaction\" and that the setting \"suggests an intimate, focused moment.\" A better approach would be to objectively describe the transition: \"her focused expression, with slightly furrowed brows, softens as her lips curve into a gentle smile.\" Finally, the phrase \"engaged with\" is vague; a more descriptive action, such as \"kneeling on a wooden floor, she lifts the watch from the velvet-lined interior of the chest,\" would provide a much clearer picture of the scene.",
