    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and effectively follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"circular light patterns resembling bokeh effects,\" which is the most precise and objective way to describe such an abstract visual. The description of their attributes—varying sizes, warm hues (gold, orange, yellow), and dynamic behavior (floating, overlapping)—accurately reflects the typical appearance of this kind of video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is complete, capturing all the essential visual information. It covers the shape, color, size, intensity, and spatial arrangement of the light patterns. By mentioning that the circles \"create a sense of depth and movement\" and that the composition is \"dynamic,\" it provides a comprehensive overview of the video's visual texture and flow without needing to detail specific frame-by-frame changes.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly identifies the most salient elements (the light patterns) as the subjects and focuses the entire description on them.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Handling of Abstract Scenery:** It perfectly follows the specific instruction for videos without salient subjects. It identifies the scene type (\"abstract scene\") and describes the overall composition and atmosphere, correctly noting that the focus is on the collective pattern rather than a single object.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective language (\"circular,\" \"warm hues,\" \"scattered\") and avoids emotional or overly subjective adjectives. Terms like \"dynamic\" and \"visually rich\" are used appropriately to describe the complexity and motion of the composition, not to convey a feeling.\n*   **Attribute Detail:** It provides specific visual attributes as requested, such as shape (\"circular\"), color (\"gold, orange, and yellow\"), and size (\"vary in size\").\n\nIn summary, the caption is an excellent example of how to apply the given instructions to an abstract video. It is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres strictly to all the stylistic and content-related guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents an abstract scene filled with circular light patterns that evoke bokeh effects. These circles differ in size and intensity, showcasing warm shades of gold, orange, and yellow. The lights are dispersed throughout the frame, creating a sense of depth and movement. The composition is dynamic, with the glowing circles appearing to float and overlap, resulting in a visually rich and textured appearance.",
