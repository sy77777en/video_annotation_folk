    "pre_caption": "The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. On the left is a close-up of the head of a large, gray-blue cat with a white muzzle, yellow eyes, and long black whiskers; its expression changes from shocked to angry. To the right, a much smaller, full-bodied cat, identical in facial structure but entirely red, is dressed as a devil in a red bodysuit with a pointed tail and red shoes. This red cat, holding a red trident, is positioned on a small white cloud and faces the larger cat with a menacing expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. The gray-blue character on the left is shown in a close-up of its head, while the red character on the right is shown in full body.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to a key negative constraint in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"two cartoon-style animated cats\" and precisely describes their visual attributes, including the gray-blue cat's size, color, and facial features, and the red cat's smaller size, devil costume, trident, and position on a cloud. The description of their relative positions (\"On the left,\" \"To the right\") and interaction (\"faces the larger cat\") is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures the most salient details of both subjects, their distinguishing features, and the dynamic nature of the scene by noting that the larger cat's \"expression changes.\" It provides enough information for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions well. It is a concise, single paragraph, uses precise subject types, avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame,\" and describes the scene holistically.\n\nHowever, it critically fails on one instruction: **\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"**\n\nThe caption uses the words **\"shocked,\" \"angry,\"** and **\"menacing.\"** These are subjective interpretations of the cats' expressions. A compliant caption would describe the objective physical attributes of the expressions instead. For example, instead of \"shocked,\" it could say \"its eyes widen and its mouth opens,\" and instead of \"angry,\" it could say \"its eyebrows furrow and its teeth are bared.\" This single but significant violation makes the caption incorrect according to the provided rules.",
