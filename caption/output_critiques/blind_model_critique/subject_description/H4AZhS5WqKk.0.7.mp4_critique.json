    "pre_caption": "The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. On the left is a close-up of the head of a large, gray-blue cat with a white muzzle, yellow eyes, and long black whiskers; its expression changes from shocked to angry. To the right, a much smaller, full-bodied cat, identical in facial structure but entirely red, is dressed as a devil in a red bodysuit with a pointed tail and red shoes. This red cat, holding a red trident, is positioned on a small white cloud and faces the larger cat with a menacing expression.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features two cartoon-style animated cats. The gray-blue character on the left is shown in a close-up of its head, while the red character on the right is shown in full body.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the two main subjects and their general roles, but it lacks the specific visual details that bring the animated action to life. It mentions the gray-blue cat is \"punched,\" but fails to describe that the red cat winds up its arm dramatically before lunging forward, its fist connecting with a visible \"POW!\" graphic that flashes on screen. The description of the gray-blue cat's expressions is also too abstract; its \"shocked\" state is visually represented by its eyes bulging out of their sockets and its jaw dropping to the bottom of the screen, and its subsequent \"angrier\" state is shown by its face turning beet-red with steam whistling from its ears, classic cartoon tropes that are omitted. Furthermore, the claim that the cats are \"identical in facial structure\" is inaccurate; the red devil cat has sharper, more angular features and a permanent, mischievous grin, unlike the rounder-faced gray-blue cat. Finally, the caption misses the secondary actions of the props; the red cat's trident is not just held but is spun skillfully before the attack, and the white cloud it stands on wobbles and deforms with the force of its lunge, adding to the scene's dynamism.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features two cartoon-style animated cats in a dynamic scene. On the left is a close-up of a large, gray-blue cat with a white muzzle, yellow eyes, and long black whiskers. Its expressions are vividly animated: its eyes bulge out of their sockets and its jaw drops to the bottom of the screen in shock, then its face turns beet-red with steam whistling from its ears in anger. To the right, a smaller, full-bodied red cat, dressed as a devil in a red bodysuit with a pointed tail and red shoes, stands on a small white cloud. This red cat, with sharper, more angular features and a permanent mischievous grin, skillfully spins a red trident before dramatically winding up its arm and lunging forward. As its fist connects with the gray-blue cat, a \"POW!\" graphic flashes on screen. The white cloud wobbles and deforms with the force of the lunge, adding to the scene's lively action.",
