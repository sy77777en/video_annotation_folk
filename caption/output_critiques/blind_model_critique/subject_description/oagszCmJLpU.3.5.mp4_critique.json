    "pre_caption": "This video is a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of the environment rather than a specific main subject. A colossal, dark supercell storm cloud with a defined, shelf-like structure dominates the sky, its turbulent base churning ominously. Below the darkest part of the formation, the atmosphere is tinged with a sickly green light, a common indicator of severe weather, as curtains of heavy precipitation fall onto the flat, open prairie below. The sheer size of the weather system, filling the entire upper portion of the frame, makes the storm itself the central element, highlighting the raw power of nature.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape shot focused on a supercell storm, it misses several key visual elements that define the scene's drama and scale. The description of the prairie as simply \"flat\" and \"open\" is too generic; the video clearly shows a faint dirt road stretching toward the horizon and a solitary, distant wind turbine, which serve as crucial reference points to emphasize the storm's sheer size. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention the frequent, brilliant flashes of intra-cloud lightning that intermittently illuminate the storm's turbulent interior, a significant and captivating feature of the footage. The description of the cloud's \"churning\" base is accurate but understates the motion; the video appears to be a time-lapse, showing the entire supercell in a slow, deliberate rotation, a defining characteristic of this type of weather system. Lastly, while the \"curtains of heavy precipitation\" are mentioned, the caption omits the visible wall of dust and debris being kicked up at the ground level by the powerful outflow winds preceding the rain, adding another layer of dynamic action to the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scene, showcasing the immense scale and atmosphere of a supercell storm. Dominating the sky is a colossal, dark storm cloud with a defined, shelf-like structure, its turbulent base churning ominously. The video, likely a time-lapse, reveals the entire supercell in a slow, deliberate rotation, a hallmark of such weather systems. Below the darkest part of the formation, the atmosphere is tinged with a sickly green light, a common indicator of severe weather, as curtains of heavy precipitation fall onto the prairie.
