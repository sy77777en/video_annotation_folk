    "pre_caption": "From a top-down perspective, a pair of light-skinned hands in a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt interacts with a collection of items on a textured surface. Initially, the hands are near a piece of beige paper featuring a chaotic, scribbled drawing of a black, monstrous figure with a red, open mouth and radiating lines. Several metal washers and a screw are scattered on the paper. The hands then move to open a rectangular, reddish-brown box, revealing its contents. Inside the box is an assortment of objects, including a small brass compass, two spinning tops, old black-and-white photographs, a handwritten letter, a red circular disc, and other small trinkets.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.\n\nA smooth description of the video angle, avoiding the use of parts",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nAssuming the video content matches the description, the accuracy is outstanding. The caption uses specific, verifiable details (e.g., \"light-skinned hands,\" \"beige paper,\" \"reddish-brown box,\" \"brass compass\") that suggest careful observation. It avoids making assumptions and sticks to what is visually present.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures the main subjects, their key attributes, and the primary action sequence of the video. It begins with the initial scene (hands, paper, drawing) and progresses logically to the main event (opening the box and revealing its contents). The list of items inside the box is comprehensive, giving a strong sense of a \"memory box\" or collection of keepsakes. The phrase \"and other small trinkets\" is a good way to acknowledge the presence of more items without sacrificing conciseness, which is a practical and acceptable choice.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It strikes an excellent balance. The paragraph is dense with information but remains easy to read and understand.\n*   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** The description is centered entirely on the subjects (hands, paper, box, contents) and their visual characteristics (color, material, shape, state).\n*   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes the action of the entire video into a single, coherent narrative without referring to specific frames (e.g., it uses \"Initially\" and \"then\" to show progression).\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, professional, and flows well.\n*   **Single Paragraph Format:** The output is a single, well-structured paragraph as requested.\n*   **Objective Language:** It successfully avoids subjective emotional adjectives. While \"chaotic\" and \"monstrous\" could be seen as subjective, in the context of describing a drawing's style, they function as effective visual descriptors rather than emotional judgments.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"hands,\" \"washers,\" \"screw,\" \"compass\") and distinguishes them clearly.\n*   **Order of Description:** The description follows a logical temporal order, describing the subjects and actions as they unfold, which is the most effective structure for this video.\n*   **Revealing Subjects:** It perfectly executes the instruction to describe revealing subjects by detailing the opening of the box and the subsequent reveal of its contents.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and meticulously crafted to meet every constraint, resulting in a clear and vivid description of the video's content. There are no significant flaws.",
