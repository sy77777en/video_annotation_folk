    "pre_caption": "The video shows a young person with blonde hair and glasses, wearing a purple shirt, an orange vest, and dark pants. They stand outdoors in front of a rocky wall and a sign that reads \"ODIN FINCH NATIONAL PARK\". The person holds a blue umbrella over their head with their left hand and reads from a white book held in their right hand. The video zooms in slightly on the person as they continue to read.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject, their clothing, and key objects, but it misses the opportunity to convey the video's specific atmosphere and narrative tone. While it mentions the umbrella, it fails to state the implied weather, such as a light but steady rain, which would explain both the umbrella and the damp appearance of the moss-covered rock wall behind the person. The description of the \"young person\" could be more specific; they appear to be a teenager, and their expression is one of deep concentration, almost melancholic, which connects to the emotional subtitle. The \"camera screen overlay\" is a crucial stylistic choice, and the caption should detail its components, like the blinking red \"REC\" icon and a digital timestamp in the corner, to better establish the \"home video\" feel. Furthermore, the \"white book\" is a paperback, and its pages seem slightly curled from the damp air. The unsteady zoom feels intimate and almost intrusive, as if the person filming is trying to capture a private, poignant moment, a nuance that is lost in the current, more technical description of the camera movement.",
