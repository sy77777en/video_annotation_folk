    "pre_caption": "The main subject is an East Asian man with a thin mustache and black hair styled away from his face, wearing a dark blue, round-collared tunic. He stands in the center with a tense expression, looking forward and slightly to his right. He is surrounded by other East Asian men dressed in official-looking grey and black robes with distinctive black, boxy hats. The man immediately to the main subject's left grabs his collar, while an older man to his right holds a sword with the blade resting on his shoulder. Another man in similar attire is visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central East Asian man and the general attire of the surrounding figures, it lacks precision and misses key dynamic details from the video. The description of the sword is confusing; in the video, the older man to the right is the one holding the sword, with its blade resting on his shoulder, and he slowly lowers it toward the main subject. The man on the left is not holding the sword itself but is gripping its empty, ornate scabbard at his hip. The caption should also provide more detail on the supporting characters; for instance, the \"older man\" has a long, thin white beard and a deeply wrinkled brow, conveying a sense of authority, while the man on the left has a clean-shaven, impassive face. The \"official-looking robes\" are more specific: they are layered silk garments with embroidered patches on the chest indicating rank, and the \"boxy hats\" are traditional Korean *gat* made of black horsehair. Furthermore, the caption describes a static scene, but the video shows subtle movements: the main subject's Adam's apple bobs as he swallows, and his eyes shift from the older man to the sword's gleaming blade. Finally, instead of the subjective \"tense expression,\" a more objective description would be \"with a furrowed brow, a tightened jaw, and eyes fixed forward,\" which better captures the visual evidence without interpreting emotion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An East Asian man with a thin mustache and black hair styled away from his face stands at the center, wearing a dark blue, round-collared tunic. His brow is furrowed, jaw tightened, and eyes fixed forward, occasionally shifting to the gleaming blade of a sword. To his right, an older man with a long, thin white beard and a deeply wrinkled brow holds the sword, its blade resting on his shoulder, slowly lowering it toward the central figure. To the left, another man with a clean-shaven, impassive face grips the ornate scabbard of the sword at his hip. Surrounding them are other East Asian men in layered silk garments with embroidered patches on the chest indicating rank, and wearing traditional Korean *gat* made of black horsehair. The scene is dynamic, with the main subject's Adam's apple bobbing as he swallows, adding to the tension.",
