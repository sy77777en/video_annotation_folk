    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot dominated by a colossal and ominous storm system. Dark, turbulent grey and black clouds churn across the sky, with a prominent, low-hanging white shelf cloud stretching across the middle, suggesting an approaching severe weather event. Below this menacing sky, a vast, flat field of vibrant yellow flowers extends to the horizon, where a small cluster of distant trees and buildings is dwarfed by the immense scale of the cloud formation. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on capturing the powerful, foreboding atmosphere and the overwhelming scale of the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a landscape dominated by a storm, it relies heavily on subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"colossal,\" \"ominous,\" and \"menacing,\" which the instructions advise against. A more objective description would focus purely on the visual facts. For instance, instead of an \"ominous storm system,\" you could describe it as a \"large, dense storm system with a dark grey base and a textured upper region.\" The caption also misses key dynamic elements likely visible in the video; for example, it doesn't mention the strong winds causing the yellow-green plants in the field to ripple and sway, nor does it describe the specific quality of light, such as sharp sunlight illuminating the field in stark contrast to the dark, shadowed underside of the clouds. Furthermore, if the video included distant rain shafts descending from the cloud base or faint, intermittent flashes of lightning within the cloud mass, these would be crucial details to include for a comprehensive visual account. The description of the clouds as \"churning\" is good, as it implies motion, but it could be more specific if the video showed a clear rotation, which could be described as a \"slowly rotating cloud formation.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a large, dense storm system with a dark grey base and a textured upper region, dominating the landscape. The sky features a prominent, low-hanging white shelf cloud stretching across the middle, indicating an approaching severe weather event. Below, a vast, flat field of vibrant yellow-green flowers extends to the horizon, where a small cluster of distant trees and buildings is visible. The strong winds cause the plants in the field to ripple and sway, adding dynamic movement to the scene. Sharp sunlight illuminates the field, creating a stark contrast with the dark, shadowed underside of the clouds. The clouds exhibit a churning motion, and if visible, a slow rotation could be noted. Additionally, distant rain shafts descending from the cloud base and faint, intermittent flashes of lightning within the cloud mass enhance the dramatic visual elements of the scene.",
