The distant shoreline is lined with indistinct, silhouetted buildings, their outlines softened by the mist, while the foreground features stone steps and platforms partially submerged by gentle waves. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, emphasizing the interplay between water, light, and distant architecture rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately identifies the video as a \"waterfront landscape scenery shot.\" It precisely describes the key visual elements: the \"choppy water,\" the \"hazy, overcast sky,\" the \"faintly visible\" sun, the \"indistinct, silhouetted buildings,\" and the \"partially submerged\" stone steps.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It covers the foreground, midground (water), and background (sky and shoreline). Crucially, it correctly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by including a clear explanation for the absence of a main subject: \"...the focus is on the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment...\".\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Format:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text, as required.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and descriptive, providing a strong visual summary without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It successfully avoids subjective adjectives that convey emotion. Terms like \"choppy,\" \"hazy,\" \"indistinct,\" and \"gentle\" are used to describe visual attributes, not to evoke feelings.\n    *   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly identifies that there is no single salient subject and instead describes the overall scene, which is the correct approach for a landscape video according to the instructions.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** The caption correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole, integrating details from across the video's duration rather than focusing on a specific moment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a waterfront landscape scene, showcasing a vast stretch of choppy water beneath a hazy, overcast sky, with the sun faintly visible through the clouds. The distant shoreline features indistinct, silhouetted buildings, their outlines softened by the mist, while the foreground includes stone steps and platforms partially submerged by gentle waves. The video emphasizes the overall atmosphere and scale of the environment, highlighting the interplay between water, light, and distant architecture rather than focusing on any specific object or individual.",
