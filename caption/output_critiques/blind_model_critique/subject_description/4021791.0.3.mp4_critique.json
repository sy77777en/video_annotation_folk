    "pre_caption": "A person, wearing a blue, white, and red helmet, a black chest protector with yellow and green accents over a red and black long-sleeved jersey, red and black pants, and black boots, rides an orange and white dirt bike with a black seat.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a thorough inventory of the rider's gear and the bike's colors, it lacks dynamism and misses key visual details that would likely be central to the video. The term \"navigates\" is too passive; the video probably shows the rider performing a more specific and dramatic action, such as leaning hard into a sharp turn, causing the bike to be angled low to the ground, or becoming airborne after launching off a dirt ramp. The description also overlooks the significant interaction between the bike and the environment; a crucial visual element would be the rear tire aggressively kicking up a large plume of dark soil and grass, underscoring the power and speed of the machine. Furthermore, the description of the orange and white dirt bike could be more specific by mentioning prominent branding, such as a \"KTM\" logo on the side fairings, or a race number on the front and side plates, which are key identifiers in motorsport. Finally, while the view is described as \"from the back and side,\" the caption doesn't capture the likely camera movement, such as a smooth pan that follows the rider's trajectory, keeping them centered as they speed across the terrain.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A rider, clad in a vibrant blue, white, and red helmet, a striking black chest protector with yellow and green accents over a red and black jersey, and matching red and black pants, powers through the grassy terrain on an orange and white KTM dirt bike, marked with the number \"7\" on its side panel. The rider, gripping the handlebars with red gloves, leans aggressively into a sharp turn, the bike angled low to the ground, as the rear tire kicks up a dramatic plume of dark soil and grass. The camera smoothly pans to follow the rider's dynamic movement, capturing the thrilling speed and power of the machine as it races across the landscape.",
