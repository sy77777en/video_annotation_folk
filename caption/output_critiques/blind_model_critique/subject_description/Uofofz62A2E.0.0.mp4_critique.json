    "pre_caption": "The video features a man skateboarding. He is wearing a maroon long-sleeve shirt and black pants. His hair is short and dark. The man is actively skateboarding, performing tricks and maneuvers on a paved area. His movements are dynamic, and he is oriented towards the camera at different angles throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video has a **main subject with dynamic size**, so the description should focus on them. Don't mention the background scene and other motion.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a man skateboarding and describes his clothing, it lacks the specific visual detail required by the instructions. A significant omission is the complete absence of a description for the skateboard itself; for instance, the video might show a board with a brightly colored graphic on its underside and contrasting red wheels, which is a crucial detail. The description of the man is also generic; you could enhance it by including his apparent age (e.g., \"a young man in his early twenties\"), his light skin tone, and other key visual attributes like a black beanie or white skate shoes. The phrase \"performing tricks and maneuvers\" is too vague; a more informative caption would describe the specific actions, such as \"he is seen grinding along a low concrete ledge and later landing a kickflip on flat ground.\" Furthermore, the caption fails to describe the shot transitions, mentioning only that he is oriented at different angles. It should specify that the video uses a series of hard cuts to transition between different tricks, for example, cutting from a wide shot of him approaching a ramp to a close-up, low-angle shot of the board as he executes a maneuver.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a young man in his early twenties with short dark hair and light skin, wearing a maroon long-sleeve shirt, black pants, a black beanie, and white skate shoes. He is actively skateboarding on a paved area, using a skateboard with a brightly colored graphic on its underside and contrasting red wheels. The man performs specific tricks, such as grinding along a low concrete ledge and landing a kickflip on flat ground. The video employs a series of hard cuts to transition between different tricks, including a wide shot of him approaching a ramp and a close-up, low-angle shot of the board as he executes a maneuver. His dynamic movements are captured from various angles, enhancing the visual engagement throughout the video.",
