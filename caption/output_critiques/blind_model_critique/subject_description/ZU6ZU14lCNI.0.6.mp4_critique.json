    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot, looking up at the interior of a grand building's ornate dome. The dome features a large, circular stained-glass skylight with a grid pattern and a greenish tint, illuminated from above or within, and is surrounded by intricate, decorative plasterwork and a ring of small lights. A large, multi-tiered chandelier hangs down from the center below the skylight. There is no main subject because the focus is intentionally broad, capturing the overall grandeur, intricate details, and atmosphere of the architectural space itself, emphasizing the environment and scale rather than a specific person or object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the scene as an architectural shot of a dome, it overlooks several key visual details that contribute to its grandeur. The description of the \"intricate, decorative plasterwork\" could be more specific; the plasterwork is predominantly white and features repeating patterns of gilded acanthus leaves and sculpted rosettes, which are not mentioned. The caption notes the multi-tiered chandelier but fails to describe its material—a dark, polished bronze—or the fact that its own lights are unlit, with its many teardrop-shaped crystal pendants instead reflecting the light from above. Furthermore, the \"ring of small lights\" are more specifically warm-toned, recessed spotlights that cast a soft glow upwards, highlighting the gold leaf on the plasterwork. The description misses the significant visual contrast between the cool, diffuse greenish light filtering through the skylight and the warm, focused light from the spotlights below. Finally, the shot also includes the upper portions of four large, arched pendentives at the base of the dome, decorated with painted murals of figures in flowing robes, which are entirely omitted from the description.",
