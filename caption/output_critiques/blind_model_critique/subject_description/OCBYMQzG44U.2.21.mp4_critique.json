    "pre_caption": "This video presents a liminal space scenery shot of a room partially submerged in dark, murky water. The walls are lined with a grid of small, pale green tiles, all bathed in a dim, unsettling greenish-yellow light. Emerging from the gently rippling surface of the water is the top of a dark, arched opening in the back wall, its interior shrouded in complete blackness. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a mysterious and eerie atmosphere. The low camera angle, positioned at the water's surface, immerses the viewer in the strange environment rather than focusing on any specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several critical instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:** The primary failure of the caption is its heavy reliance on subjective language that conveys emotion and atmosphere. The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words and phrases like \"liminal space,\" \"unsettling,\" \"mysterious and eerie,\" and \"strange.\" These terms describe a feeling or interpretation rather than objective visual facts.\n\n2.  **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"This video presents...,\" which is a form of introductory text. The instructions are very clear on this point: \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\"\n\n3.  **Analysis of Cinematography and Intent:** The caption goes beyond describing the visual content and analyzes the creator's technique and purpose. The instructions for scenery shots allow for explaining *why* there is no main subject, but this should be done by describing the visual composition (e.g., \"the focus is on the environment as a whole\"). Instead, the caption speculates on intent (\"the shot's purpose is to establish a mysterious and eerie atmosphere\") and cinematic choices (\"The low camera angle... immerses the viewer\"). This is an analysis, not a description.\n\n4.  **Accuracy of Description:** While the description of the physical elements (tiles, water, archway) is generally accurate, the use of the term \"murky\" for the water is an assumption. The water is dark, but whether it is murky (cloudy with sediment) is not clearly visible. The instruction \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\" applies here.\n\nIn summary, while the caption correctly identifies the scene's components, it fundamentally misunderstands the task's core requirements by injecting subjective interpretation, analyzing intent, and including forbidden introductory phrasing. A good caption would have described the scene's elements—the room with pale green tiled walls, the dark water filling the lower portion, and the dark, arched opening—using only objective, neutral language.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A room partially filled with dark water features walls covered in a grid of small, pale green tiles. The space is illuminated by a dim greenish-yellow light. The top of a dark, arched opening is visible above the water's surface on the back wall, with its interior appearing completely black. The camera angle is low, positioned at the water's surface, focusing on the environment as a whole.",
