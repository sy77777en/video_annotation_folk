  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and follows the specific instructions for that scenario, but it violates a key negative constraint.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video does indeed show a coastline, the caption is accurate in its description of the content (coastline, ocean, surrounding land). It correctly identifies that there is no single salient subject.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete according to the specific instructions for scenery shots. It specifies the type of scenery (\"landscape scenery shot\") and explains why there is no main subject (\"The focus is on the natural environment... The emphasis is on the scale... rather than a specific object\").\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Correct Format for Scenery:** It follows the rule for videos without salient subjects by describing the type of scenery and explaining the focus on the overall environment.\n*   **Conciseness and Structure:** It is a concise, single paragraph, as required.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids forbidden terms like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Clarity:** The language is simple and easy to understand.\n\n**What the caption does wrong (Violations):**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The primary violation is the use of subjective language. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\"\n    *   The caption uses the word \"**beauty**\" (\"...scale and beauty of the landscape...\"). Beauty is subjective and not a factual visual attribute.\n    *   It also uses the word \"**immersive**\" (\"...creating an atmospheric and immersive experience.\"). This describes a potential effect on the viewer, which is subjective, rather than a visual characteristic of the scene itself.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption's structure and intent are correct, but its execution is flawed due to the inclusion of subjective words. To be fully compliant, it must be revised to describe the scene using only objective, factual language.\n\n**Example of a corrected version:**\n\n\"This is a landscape scenery shot focused on the natural environment. It shows an expansive view of a coastline, an ocean, and the adjacent land, with an emphasis on the scale of the landscape rather than on any specific subject.\"",
