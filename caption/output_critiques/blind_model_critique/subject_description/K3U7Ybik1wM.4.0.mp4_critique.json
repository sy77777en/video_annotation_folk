    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot depicting a dramatic twilight sky over a rural setting. The focus is on the atmospheric quality of the environment rather than a specific subject, using the vastness of the sky to create a sense of scale and mood. The scene is dominated by a deep blue-grey sky filled with dark, heavy clouds. Near the horizon, the last light of the setting sun casts a soft orange and pink glow. Two long, thin contrails, brightly illuminated by the sun, streak across the upper portion of the sky in a vibrant orange hue. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of several trees, including tall evergreens and a large, leafy deciduous tree, stand in stark contrast against the colorful twilight.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a landscape at twilight and precisely describes its key components: the deep blue and grey sky, the dark clouds, the orange and pink glow at the horizon, the two illuminated contrails, and the silhouetted trees in the foreground.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully captures all the salient visual information. It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and provides the required explanation for why there is no main subject, focusing instead on the atmosphere and scale.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption perfectly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots. It begins by identifying it as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and then explains that \"The focus is on the atmospheric quality of the environment rather than a specific subject,\" which is exactly what was requested.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and rich with information. The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Subject & Attribute Description:** It uses precise terms like \"contrails,\" \"evergreens,\" and \"deciduous tree.\" It provides specific visual attributes for each element, such as the \"deep blue-grey sky,\" \"soft orange and pink glow,\" and \"vibrant orange hue\" of the contrails.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** The caption successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to specific moments in time.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective adjectives that convey emotion. While \"dramatic\" is used, it functions here as a descriptor of the visual contrast and intensity of the sky, which is appropriate for describing atmosphere as per the instructions.\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and structured precisely according to the rules provided.",
