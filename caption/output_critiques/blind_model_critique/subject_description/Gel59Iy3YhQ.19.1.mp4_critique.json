    "pre_caption": "The video features two pixelated figures. On the left, a figure with light skin wears a green pointed hat, a green upper garment, and brown lower garments or boots; this figure is consistently oriented to the right and appears to be holding an object. On the right, another figure, also facing right and holding a weapon, is initially depicted clad in metallic, possibly silver or grey, full-body armor including a helmet. This second figure is later shown wearing distinctly blue full-body armor, also including a helmet, while maintaining a similar pose, orientation, and position on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two pixelated subjects and their primary colors, it lacks specificity and clarity in several key areas. The term \"figure\" is too vague; using \"character\" or a more descriptive noun like \"man\" for the first subject and \"armored creature\" for the second would be more precise. The description of the first character's attire is confusing: stating the \"arms are green\" while the \"hands and legs are off-white\" and the \"upper garment\" is red creates a conflicting image. It would be clearer to describe it as a character wearing a red shirt with green sleeves and off-white gloves. Furthermore, the \"off-white weapon\" is not described by its shape (e.g., a hammer, a sword), which is a critical visual attribute. The description of the second character is particularly sparse, failing to mention its overall form—is it bipedal, quadrupedal, or turtle-like? Details about its head, limbs, or any other features besides its blue and silver armor are missing. Finally, the description of the action is incomplete; it mentions the red character jumping on the blue one but omits the result of this interaction, which is likely a central event in the video, such as the blue character being defeated, stunned, or retreating into its armor.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features two pixelated characters. On the left, a character with light skin wears a red shirt with green sleeves, off-white gloves, and brown pants or boots; this character is consistently oriented to the right and appears to be holding an off-white sword. On the right, an armored creature, possibly bipedal, initially appears clad in metallic, possibly silver or grey, full-body armor including a helmet. This creature is later shown wearing distinctly blue full-body armor, also including a helmet, while maintaining a similar pose, orientation, and position on the right. The red-shirted character jumps on the blue-armored creature, resulting in the creature being stunned and momentarily retreating into its armor.",
