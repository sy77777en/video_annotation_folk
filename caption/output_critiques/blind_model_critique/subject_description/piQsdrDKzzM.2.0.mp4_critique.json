    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with short, dark hair and a medium skin tone. He is wearing a dark jacket and appears to be in a dimly lit environment. His expression is serious and contemplative. The man is positioned near a car, suggesting he might be interacting with it or preparing to leave. His posture is upright, and he seems to be focused on something outside the frame. The setting appears to be an indoor parking area, adding a sense of isolation to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and setting but includes subjective interpretations and lacks specific visual detail. The use of \"serious and contemplative\" and the phrase \"adding a sense of isolation to the scene\" are emotional assessments, which the instructions advise against. A more objective description of his expression, such as \"his mouth is closed and his gaze is directed off-camera,\" would be more appropriate. The caption also speculates on his actions with \"suggesting he might be interacting with it or preparing to leave,\" which should be avoided. The description could be significantly improved by adding concrete details that I can see in the video. For example, the \"dark jacket\" is actually a black leather jacket with silver zippers, worn over a plain white t-shirt. The man is also wearing blue jeans and black boots. The car is not just a generic car; it's a dark blue, four-door sedan, and the man is standing beside the driver's door with his hand resting on the handle, which is a key detail about his pose and relationship to the object. Describing these specific visual attributes would make the caption more informative and aligned with the instructions.",
