    "pre_caption": "The video shows the interior of a yurt, revealed through a panning camera motion. The structure has a distinctive wooden lattice wall and a conical roof with radiating wooden poles, covered by a white fabric liner. The space is furnished with a small kitchenette area featuring a wooden countertop, a white mini-fridge, and a black electric kettle. Other furniture includes a blue armchair holding a brown furry pillow, a blue chest of drawers, and a light-wood chest of drawers decorated with small Christmas-themed figures. A white electric heater is mounted on the wall, and a black and orange backpack rests on the dark floor near a wooden door. A person's light-skinned hand appears, holding a padlock and key on a light blue tag, and hangs it on a wooden hook on the wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is very good, but with a couple of minor deviations from the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as the interior of a yurt and precisely describes its key structural features, such as the \"wooden lattice wall\" and \"conical roof with radiating wooden poles.\" It accurately lists and describes the various objects and furniture within the space, including their colors and materials (e.g., \"blue armchair,\" \"brown furry pillow,\" \"white mini-fridge,\" \"black and orange backpack\"). The description of the final action—a \"light-skinned hand\" appearing and hanging a \"padlock and key on a light blue tag\"—is also specific and correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It provides a comprehensive overview of the scene, starting with the overall environment (the yurt) and then detailing the specific contents and the single human action that occurs. It successfully combines details from across the video into a single, coherent summary, giving the reader a full understanding of the visual content without needing to see the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but it has two minor flaws:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It uses precise terms for subjects (\"yurt,\" \"armchair,\" \"backpack\") instead of vague words.\n    *   It provides excellent, specific visual attributes for subjects (e.g., \"light-wood chest of drawers decorated with small Christmas-themed figures\").\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not use subjective emotional adjectives.\n    *   It correctly describes the appearance of a new subject (\"A person's light-skinned hand appears...\") and its subsequent action.\n    *   The subjects are described in a logical order, starting with the largest environmental subject and moving to smaller objects and the final action.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    1.  **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\" The instructions state to return \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A more compliant opening would be to start directly with the description, such as: \"The interior of a yurt is revealed...\" or \"The interior of a yurt features a distinctive wooden lattice wall...\"\n    2.  **Mention of Motion:** The caption mentions \"revealed through a panning camera motion.\" The instructions state to \"avoid mentioning the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" In this case, the description of the yurt's interior is sufficient on its own, and mentioning the camera's movement is not essential to understanding the subjects themselves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, detail, and overall structure. It successfully captures the essence of the video's content. However, to be perfectly compliant with the instructions, it should omit the introductory phrase \"The video shows...\" and the reference to the \"panning camera motion.\"",
