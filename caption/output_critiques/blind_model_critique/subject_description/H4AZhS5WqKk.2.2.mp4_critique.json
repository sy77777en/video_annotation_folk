    "pre_caption": "The video features two animated characters: a large blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with white paws, a white face, and pink inner ears, and a small brown mouse with large ears and a tan belly. The cat, who is standing on a bed and reaching forward with both arms extended, is focused on the mouse, who is positioned near a black remote control on the bed. The mouse is much smaller in size, with a slender build and a pointed nose, and appears alert. At one point, the cat uses both hands to grasp the edge of a pillowcase or bag, suggesting an attempt to capture the mouse. The cat’s body is oriented toward the mouse, and its posture is active and intent on pursuit, while the mouse remains close to the remote control, emphasizing the size difference and the dynamic between the two characters.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows Tom chasing Jerry with dramatic changes in shot size. Tom first appears in a full-body shot as he jumps in from the side of the screen. He then puts Jerry in a bag. In the final moment, Tom attempts to jump down and exit the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly balances being concise with being informative and adheres meticulously to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as an \"anthropomorphic cat\" and a \"mouse,\" which is a precise description of characters like Tom and Jerry without making unverified assumptions about their specific identities. The descriptions of their colors (\"blue-gray,\" \"white,\" \"brown,\" \"tan\"), physical features (\"white paws,\" \"pink inner ears,\" \"large ears,\" \"slender build\"), and relative sizes are all correct. The actions, such as the cat reaching and grasping a pillowcase, are also described accurately as they happen in the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive without being overly long. It successfully captures the most essential information:\n*   **Subjects:** Both the cat and the mouse are identified and described in detail.\n*   **Attributes:** Key visual attributes for both characters are included, giving a clear mental picture.\n*   **Context:** The setting on a \"bed\" and the presence of a \"black remote control\" are included, which is crucial for understanding the subjects' positions and the scale of the scene.\n*   **Action & Interaction:** The caption effectively summarizes the dynamic of pursuit and evasion by describing the cat's posture as \"active and intent on pursuit\" and its specific action of grasping the pillowcase.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is easy to read and understand.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered entirely on the cat and mouse, their attributes, and their interaction. The background is only mentioned to provide necessary context for their location.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives. Phrases like \"appears alert\" and \"intent on pursuit\" are acceptable as they describe a physical state and posture derived directly from visual evidence, rather than speculating on the characters' feelings (e.g., \"the cat is angry\").\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses specific terms (\"anthropomorphic cat,\" \"mouse\") and clearly distinguishes between them throughout the text.\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details about color, body parts, and build for both subjects.\n*   **Pose and Orientation:** It clearly describes the subjects' poses (\"standing,\" \"reaching forward\") and orientation (\"oriented toward the mouse\").\n*   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes information from the entire video into a single narrative, using phrases like \"At one point\" to integrate a specific action without breaking the flow.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and written in a clear, objective, and natural style.",
