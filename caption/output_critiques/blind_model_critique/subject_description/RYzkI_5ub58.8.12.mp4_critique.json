    "pre_caption": "The video presents a close-up view of an insect, likely a moth or skipper, resting on a thick, bright green plant stem. The insect's body is predominantly dark, possibly greenish-brown, and covered in fine hairs, with a distinct patch of dense, orange-yellow hairs on its head and the front part of its thorax. Its wings, held partially open and angled upwards over its back, are dark with subtle greenish and brownish hues, and feature a noticeable, iridescent purple or blue spot on the visible upper surface. The insect has long, slender, black antennae that are slightly thickened or clubbed at the tips and extend forward. Its large, compound eyes are a prominent reddish-brown. Several slender, dark legs with fine bristles are visible, with the insect using them to cling to the textured surface of the green stem.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the instructions with a high degree of precision. However, there is one key area for improvement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **Excellent:** The caption is highly accurate in its description. It uses precise biological terms like \"thorax,\" \"antennae,\" and \"compound eyes\" correctly. The descriptions of color (\"orange-yellow hairs,\" \"iridescent purple or blue spot\"), texture (\"covered in fine hairs,\" \"textured surface of the green stem\"), and posture (\"wings, held partially open and angled upwards\") are specific and believable for this type of subject.\n*   **Handles Ambiguity Well:** The use of \"likely a moth or skipper\" and \"possibly greenish-brown\" is a perfect execution of the instruction to avoid describing what is uncertain. It provides the best possible identification without overstating confidence.\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   **Excellent:** The description is exceptionally thorough. It covers all the salient features of the insect: its body, coloration, hair, wings, antennae, eyes, and legs. It also includes the immediate object the insect is interacting with (the plant stem), which is crucial for context. It successfully paints a full and detailed mental picture of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the vast majority of the rules perfectly, but it violates one important formatting instruction.\n\n**What it does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It balances detail and length effectively, providing a wealth of information in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the main subject (the insect) and its key visual attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The language is descriptive and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"strange\"). Words like \"distinct\" and \"prominent\" are used appropriately to highlight key features.\n*   **Precise Subject ID:** It identifies the subject as an \"insect\" and narrows it down, as instructed.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on color, texture, shape, and pose for both the insect and the stem.\n*   **Holistic View:** The description is a composite of the entire video, not a frame-by-frame account.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Introductory Text\":** The instructions state, \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"**The video presents a close-up view of...**\" This phrase is introductory text that describes the video's composition rather than the subject itself. A more compliant caption would start directly with the subject.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nTo be perfectly compliant, the caption should be edited to remove the introductory phrase, like this:\n\n\"An insect, likely a moth or skipper, rests on a thick, bright green plant stem. The insect's body is predominantly dark, possibly greenish-brown, and covered in fine hairs, with a distinct patch of dense, orange-yellow hairs on its head and the front part of its thorax. Its wings, held partially open and angled upwards over its back, are dark with subtle greenish and brownish hues, and feature a noticeable, iridescent purple or blue spot on the visible upper surface. The insect has long, slender, black antennae that are slightly thickened or clubbed at the tips and extend forward. Its large, compound eyes are a prominent reddish-brown. Several slender, dark legs with fine bristles are visible, with the insect using them to cling to the textured surface of the green stem.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is of very high quality in terms of its content, detail, and adherence to descriptive rules. Its only flaw is the inclusion of an introductory phrase, which is explicitly forbidden by the instructions.",
