    "pre_caption": "In a dark, hazy environment, several pale, unclothed human figures hang upside down, suspended by thin, dark wires attached to the ceiling. Their bodies are limp and appear lifeless. Below them, arranged in a grid-like pattern on the floor, are numerous dark, rectangular boxes. Each box has a small, glowing red light on its top surface and is connected to the ceiling by a thin, dark pole or wire. A single, bright, diffuse light source at the top of the scene illuminates the hanging figures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subjects as \"pale, unclothed human figures\" and \"dark, rectangular boxes.\" The description of their state and attributes—the figures hanging upside down by wires, appearing \"limp and lifeless,\" and the boxes arranged in a grid with \"glowing red light[s]\"—precisely matches the visual information. The use of \"appear lifeless\" is a good choice, as it describes the visual impression without making an unverified claim, thus adhering to the rule of not describing what you are unsure about.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, capturing all the essential elements of the scene. It not only describes the two main groups of subjects but also their spatial relationship (figures hanging above the boxes) and the key elements that define their appearance and the scene's atmosphere (suspended by wires, a single overhead light source, a dark and hazy environment). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear and accurate mental picture of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThe caption follows every instruction meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and packed with relevant visual detail.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on describing the subjects and their attributes, only mentioning the environment (\"dark, hazy\") and lighting as necessary context.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives, using descriptive words like \"pale,\" \"limp,\" \"dark,\" and \"rectangular.\"\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"human figures\" and \"rectangular boxes\" and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referencing specific frames or moments in time.\n*   **Structure and Prioritization:** It logically describes the hanging figures first, which are illuminated and likely the primary focus, before moving to the boxes on the floor below them. This top-down structure is natural and effective.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In a dimly lit, misty setting, several pale, unclothed human figures dangle upside down, suspended by thin, dark wires from the ceiling. Their bodies hang limp, giving an impression of lifelessness. Below them, a grid of dark, rectangular boxes is arranged on the floor, each featuring a small, glowing red light on its top surface and connected to the ceiling by a slender, dark pole or wire. A single, bright, diffuse light source at the top of the scene casts illumination on the hanging figures.",
