    "pre_caption": "This animated video features three light-skinned men standing together. The man on the left, who appears older, has white hair and is dressed in a light gray suit with a red tie and a white shirt, with his hands in his pockets. In the center, another older man with a wrinkled face and thinning gray hair stands with his arms crossed, wearing a mustard-yellow polo shirt. To the right, a younger man with brown hair and glasses wears a white short-sleeved polo shirt and gray pants, holding his hands clasped in front of him. All three men are facing each other as if in conversation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as three light-skinned men in an animated video. The descriptions of their individual appearances are precise, including details like the older man's white hair and suit, the central man's mustard-yellow polo and crossed arms, and the younger man's glasses and white polo. All described attributes are visually present.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It provides key visual attributes for each of the three subjects, covering their apparent age, hair, clothing (color and style), and pose (hands in pockets, arms crossed, hands clasped). It also captures their relationship and orientation by noting they are \"standing together\" and \"facing each other as if in conversation.\"\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all the given instructions perfectly:\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph that delivers all the essential information without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the three men, avoiding any mention of the background.\n    *   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise terms (\"men,\" \"suit,\" \"polo shirt\") and avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Objective Language:** The description uses factual, objective language (e.g., \"wrinkled face,\" \"thinning gray hair\") and avoids subjective emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the three men by using their location (\"on the left,\" \"in the center,\" \"to the right\") and unique visual traits.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The phrase \"as if in conversation\" is an acceptable inference based on their poses and orientation, describing their interaction as instructed, rather than speculating on unseen events.",
