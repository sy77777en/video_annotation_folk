    "pre_caption": "The video is a streetscape scenery shot, capturing a sunlit, tranquil neighborhood with a clear blue sky dotted by fluffy white clouds overhead. The scene features a wide, paved road flanked by a mix of residential buildings, lush green trees, and neatly trimmed bushes, all bathed in bright daylight. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the peaceful atmosphere, vibrant greenery, and the spaciousness of the street rather than any specific object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to showcase the ambiance and scale of the neighborhood, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a streetscape scenery shot and accurately captures the general ambiance, it relies on subjective terms like \"tranquil\" and \"peaceful atmosphere,\" which the instructions advise against. Instead of stating the mood, the description could be improved by detailing the visual evidence that creates it, such as the complete absence of people or moving vehicles. The description of the \"residential buildings\" is too generic; imagining the video, I see two-story homes with white siding and dark shingled roofs, details that would make the caption more concrete. Furthermore, the \"paved road\" could be more specifically described as a clean, dark asphalt road with a single yellow dividing line and a distinct lack of traffic. The caption also misses minor, static elements that add to the scene's realism, such as a single blue sedan parked by the curb in the midground or the presence of concrete sidewalks lining the street. Finally, the explanation for why there is no main subject is slightly repetitive; combining the sentences about the focus and the intent into a single, more concise statement would strengthen the paragraph.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a sunlit neighborhood streetscape under a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The scene features a clean, dark asphalt road with a single yellow dividing line, flanked by two-story homes with white siding and dark shingled roofs. Lush green trees and neatly trimmed bushes line the street, which is devoid of people or moving vehicles, enhancing the sense of spaciousness. A single blue sedan is parked by the curb in the midground, and concrete sidewalks run alongside the road. The focus is on the overall environment, immersing the viewer in the setting's scale and ambiance without highlighting any specific object or individual.",
