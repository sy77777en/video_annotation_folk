    "pre_caption": "This video captures a scenery shot of a spacious and verdant zoo or park. The camera pans across a landscape featuring a combination of wooden boardwalks and wide, paved paths that wind through numerous leafy green trees and planters edged with natural stone. The animal enclosures are integrated into the environment with large, artificial rock formations and simple metal fences. The focus remains on the overall environment and its peaceful atmosphere, as the camera's sweeping movement captures the scale and design of the park rather than singling out any of the few visitors strolling through the area as a primary subject.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but has a few minor issues that prevent it from being perfect. It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and follows the specific instructions for that scenario, but it violates a few key rules.\n\n#### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate. It describes a scene that is very plausible for a modern zoo or large park, including details like wooden boardwalks, paved paths, artificial rock formations for enclosures, and metal fences. The description of the camera's panning motion to capture the scale of the environment is also a correct and accurate assessment of how such a scenery shot would be filmed.\n\n#### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully conveys that the video's purpose is to show the overall environment rather than focusing on specific subjects. It mentions all the key components of the scenery (paths, trees, enclosures, rocks, fences) and even notes the presence of secondary, non-focal subjects (\"few visitors strolling\"). It effectively paints a full picture of the scene.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has both strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Correctly Follows the \"Scenery Shot\" Rule:** The caption correctly identifies that there is no salient subject and follows the specific instruction to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot\" and \"briefly explain why there is no main subject.\" The final sentence does an excellent job of this.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the video by combining details from the entire scene (\"pans across a landscape\") rather than focusing on a single moment.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses precise terms like \"trees,\" \"planters,\" \"rock formations,\" and \"fences.\"\n*   **Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Areas for Improvement / Violations:**\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption describes the environment's \"**peaceful atmosphere**,\" which is a direct violation of this rule as \"peaceful\" is an interpretation of emotion and mood.\n*   **Introductory Text:** The instruction states, \"**Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.**\" The caption begins with \"**This video captures...**\" which is considered introductory text. A better caption would start directly with the description, such as \"A scenery shot of a spacious and verdant zoo or park...\"\n*   **Conciseness and Simplicity:** While informative, the language is slightly more formal and less concise than it could be. For example, \"verdant\" could be replaced with \"leafy\" or \"green\" to adhere more closely to the \"simple, natural English\" guideline. The overall length is also a bit long for a scenery shot description that is meant to be concise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good** because it correctly understands the nature of the video and follows the most complex part of the instructions (the scenery shot rule). However, it is not perfect due to the inclusion of a subjective emotional adjective (\"peaceful\"), the use of introductory text, and slightly formal language that could be simpler and more direct.",
