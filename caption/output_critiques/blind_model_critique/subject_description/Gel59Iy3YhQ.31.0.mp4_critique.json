    "pre_caption": "A small, stylized character stands on a stone platform, completely enveloped in a dark reddish-brown, hooded cloak from which two pointed ears or horns protrude. This character holds an object that emits a vibrant purple glow. A large, spectral creature materializes from wisps of light into a translucent form outlined in a bright, neon-green glow. The creature has a stylized, cat-like appearance with a long, curving tail and sheds small, glowing green particles as it fully forms.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a \"small, stylized character\" and a \"large, spectral creature.\" The details, such as the \"dark reddish-brown, hooded cloak,\" the \"pointed ears or horns,\" the \"vibrant purple glow,\" the \"neon-green\" outline of the creature, and its \"cat-like appearance,\" are all precise and true to the visual information.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is very complete, capturing all the essential elements. It describes both subjects in detail, notes the object the character is holding, and thoroughly explains the dynamic process of the creature's materialization, including the \"wisps of light\" and the \"glowing green particles.\" It successfully synthesizes the action across the video's duration.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the two subjects and their attributes, mentioning the \"stone platform\" only for essential location context.\n    *   **No Speculation:** It correctly handles ambiguity by stating the protrusions are \"ears or horns,\" which is a responsible observation. Describing the creature as \"cat-like\" is a reasonable and well-supported visual comparison, not baseless speculation.\n    *   **Proper Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids forbidden words (\"image,\" \"frame\") and subjective emotional adjectives. The adjectives used (\"small,\" \"large,\" \"vibrant,\" \"translucent\") are purely descriptive.\n    *   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for both subjects, covering their form, color, and actions as instructed.\n    *   **Handles Transitions:** The description of the creature \"materializing from wisps of light\" is a perfect example of how to describe a subject revealing itself over time, as required by the instructions.\n    *   **Order and Clarity:** It describes the subjects in a logical order (the static character first, then the appearing creature) and clearly distinguishes between them.",
