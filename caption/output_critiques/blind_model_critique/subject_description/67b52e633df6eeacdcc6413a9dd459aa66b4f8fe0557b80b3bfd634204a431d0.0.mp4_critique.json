    "pre_caption": "The video features two women relaxing on wooden lounge chairs at a beach setting. The woman on the left has light skin and long blonde hair, wearing a green bikini and sunglasses. She is reclining comfortably, holding a book. The woman on the right also has light skin and medium-length brown hair, wearing a yellow swimsuit and sunglasses. She is seated with her legs extended, appearing relaxed. Both women are facing each other, suggesting they might be engaged in conversation. The setting is sunny, with beach umbrellas and other lounge chairs nearby.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is a good attempt but has several clear violations of the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is generally accurate in its description of the subjects. It correctly identifies two women, their approximate location, their clothing, hair color, and poses. The description of the lounge chairs as \"wooden\" and the presence of a book and sunglasses are also accurate details.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is fairly complete. It describes the key visual attributes of both primary subjects (the women), including their skin tone, hair, clothing, and posture. It also mentions key objects directly associated with them (lounge chairs, book, sunglasses).\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid Describing What You Are Unsure About\":** The caption includes the phrase, \"**suggesting they might be engaged in conversation.**\" This is a direct violation of the rule, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" You can see they are facing each other, but you cannot see or know if they are conversing.\n2.  **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives that Convey Emotions\":** The caption uses several subjective words.\n    *   \"...two women **relaxing**...\"\n    *   \"She is reclining **comfortably**...\"\n    *   \"...appearing **relaxed**.\"\n    These words describe a state of being or feeling, which is an interpretation rather than a direct visual observation. The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" A better description would focus on their physical posture, such as \"reclining\" or \"seated with legs extended.\"\n3.  **Violation of \"Don't Mention the Background... Unless It's Necessary\":** The final sentence, \"**The setting is sunny, with beach umbrellas and other lounge chairs nearby,**\" describes the background in more detail than is necessary to understand the main subjects. While mentioning the \"beach setting\" is acceptable for context, listing other specific background items like umbrellas and additional chairs is superfluous according to the strict instructions.\n\nIn summary, while the caption successfully identifies the subjects and their core attributes in a single paragraph, it fails on the critical points of avoiding speculation, subjective language, and unnecessary background detail.",
