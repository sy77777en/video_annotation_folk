    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a surreal, liminal space resembling an endless, sterile pool hallway. The focus is on the unsettling atmosphere and bizarre environment rather than a specific subject, creating a sense of unease and mystery. The scene is a long, narrow corridor with walls, a ceiling, and a narrow walkway all covered in small, white, square tiles. Alongside the walkway runs a channel of dark, murky water, separated by a simple metal railing. The space is illuminated by bright, hazy light from recessed rectangular fixtures on the walls, casting a greenish, desaturated glow over everything. At the far end of the corridor, a single, large, yellow rubber duck sits in a brightly lit alcove, serving as a strange and incongruous focal point in the otherwise empty and monotonous environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the key components of the scene—the tiled hallway, the water channel, and the large rubber duck—it could be improved by adhering more strictly to objective description and adding more specific visual detail. The caption uses subjective and interpretive language such as 'surreal,' 'unsettling atmosphere,' 'sense of unease,' and 'strange,' which should be replaced with neutral, factual observations. There is also a contradiction between describing the space as 'endless' and then mentioning a 'far end' where the duck is located. To enhance the description, you could specify the condition of the white tiles—for instance, if they are stained with watermarks or have patches of mildew near the water channel. The 'dark, murky water' could be further detailed by noting if it is completely still or has subtle ripples on its surface. The description of the 'large, yellow rubber duck' would be more informative if its scale was estimated (e.g., 'the size of a small armchair') and its material texture was described, such as being glossy plastic or having a faded, matte finish. Finally, the caption omits any description of camera movement; if the video involves a slow, steady push-in towards the duck, this is a critical detail that establishes the duck as the primary subject and defines the viewing experience.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video showcases an architectural scene of a long, narrow corridor resembling a pool hallway. The corridor is lined with small, white square tiles, some of which are stained with watermarks and patches of mildew near the water channel. A narrow walkway runs alongside a channel of dark water, which is mostly still but occasionally shows subtle ripples. A simple metal railing separates the walkway from the water. The space is illuminated by bright, recessed rectangular fixtures on the walls, casting a greenish, desaturated glow. At the end of the corridor, a large yellow rubber duck, approximately the size of a small armchair, sits in a brightly lit alcove. The duck has a glossy plastic texture, serving as a focal point in the otherwise uniform environment. The video features a slow, steady push-in towards the duck, emphasizing it as the primary subject and enhancing the viewing experience.",
