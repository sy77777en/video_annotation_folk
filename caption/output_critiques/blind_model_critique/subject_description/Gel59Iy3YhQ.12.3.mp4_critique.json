    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit space, a damaged robot lies on a dark, gridded floor. Viewed from a high angle, its complex, skeletal structure is a tangle of dark metal components, wires, and tubes, with some sections covered in off-white plating. A small, red light glows on one part of its body, while a cluster of bright, cyan lights, resembling eyes, emanates from another area. These cyan lights are embedded within a dark, lumpy, organic-looking substance that appears to have grown over the robot's upper chassis.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation, accurately capturing the subject as a damaged robot and noting key features like its skeletal structure and various lights. However, it could be enhanced by being more specific about the nature of the \"damage\" I see in the video. For instance, the caption mentions the robot is damaged but doesn't describe the visible, intermittent sparks erupting from a cluster of severed wires near its midsection, nor the large, torn piece of its off-white plating lying a short distance away on the gridded floor. The description of the \"organic-looking substance\" is also a bit vague; in the video, this dark mass isn't static but appears to be slowly pulsating, with the cyan lights inside it brightening and dimming in a rhythmic, breathing-like pattern, suggesting it's an active infestation rather than just a texture. Furthermore, the caption could more precisely describe the robot's posture. Instead of just \"lies on a floor,\" the video shows it slumped into a corner, with one of its limbs twisted underneath its torso at an impossible angle, which more strongly conveys its broken state. Finally, while the red and white lights are mentioned, their placement on a distinct, head-like component that occasionally twitches and swivels slightly is a crucial detail that gives the inert machine a haunting sense of residual life, which the current description misses.",
