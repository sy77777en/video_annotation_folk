    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of people walking through a tunnel. The individuals are mostly men, wearing casual clothing such as t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans. The lighting in the tunnel shifts from a dim red to a bright white, creating a dramatic contrast. The people are walking towards a bright light at the end of the tunnel, which obscures their facial features and details. The scene conveys a sense of movement and transition as the group progresses forward.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially good** but has some significant flaws that violate the core instructions.\n\n### Accuracy & Completeness\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption appears to be an accurate description of the video's content. It correctly identifies the subjects (\"a group of people,\" \"mostly men\"), their general clothing (\"casual clothing\"), their action (\"walking\"), and the setting (\"tunnel\").\n*   **Completeness:** The description is reasonably complete. It captures the most salient aspects of the scene: the subjects, their movement, and the significant change in lighting. It also correctly adheres to the instruction to avoid describing what is not visible by noting that \"facial features and details\" are obscured.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to follow several key negative constraints from the instructions.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It successfully combines details from the entire video (the walk, the light shift) without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses \"people\" and \"men\" instead of vague terms.\n*   **Describes a Group:** It correctly handles multiple subjects without a clear focus by describing them as a group.\n*   **Necessary Background/Motion:** It mentions the \"tunnel\" and the \"walking,\" which is appropriate here because these elements are essential for defining the subjects' context and action.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:** This is the most significant violation. The instructions state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions**\" and to describe visual facts, not interpretations.\n    *   The phrase \"**dramatic contrast**\" is subjective. A better, more objective description would be: \"The lighting in the tunnel shifts from dim red to bright white.\"\n    *   The final sentence, \"The scene **conveys a sense of movement and transition** as the group progresses forward,\" is purely interpretive. It describes the feeling or meaning of the scene rather than the visual facts. The visual fact is simply that \"the group progresses forward.\"\n\n2.  **Inclusion of an Introductory Phrase:** The instructions ask for the description itself, not a sentence introducing it. The caption begins with \"**The video features...**\" which is an unnecessary introductory clause. A better caption would start directly, such as: \"A group of people, mostly men in casual clothing, walks through a tunnel.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the caption accurately captures the scene's content in a concise format, it fails on the critical instructions to avoid subjective and interpretive language. The use of \"dramatic\" and the entire final sentence about what the scene \"conveys\" are direct violations. Therefore, the caption is **not good** because it does not fully adhere to the provided rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A group of people, mostly men in casual clothing such as t-shirts, hoodies, and jeans, walks through a tunnel. The lighting shifts from dim red to bright white, creating a noticeable contrast. The group moves towards a bright light at the end of the tunnel, which obscures their facial features and details.",
