    "pre_caption": "A white man with a dark beard and mustache is shown in a close-up, speaking to a woman. He wears a dark green beanie, a green jacket, and a lighter green tactical vest with a patch that reads \"G-25\". The woman, seen from over her shoulder, has blonde hair tied up in a bun and is wearing a light-colored collared shirt. The man is facing her, with a serious expression on his face.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption is highly accurate and detailed. It correctly identifies the two subjects (a man and a woman) and provides specific visual attributes for each. For the man, it includes his skin tone, facial hair, and a multi-layered description of his clothing, right down to the text on a patch (\"G-25\"). For the woman, it accurately describes what is visible from an over-the-shoulder perspective (hair color/style, shirt type).\n\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is presented as a single, coherent paragraph using simple and natural English. It is easy to read and understand while still being rich in detail.\n\n*   **Adherence to Negative Constraints:**\n    *   It successfully avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It does not describe the background, focusing solely on the subjects.\n    *   It avoids speculation by noting the woman is \"seen from over her shoulder\" and only describing what is visible from that angle.\n    *   It avoids subjective emotional adjectives. \"Serious expression\" is an acceptable objective description of a facial state (e.g., lack of a smile, focused eyes) rather than an emotional judgment.\n\n*   **Subject Description and Prioritization:** The caption correctly prioritizes the man, who is in a \"close-up\" and more central to the scene, describing him in detail first. It then describes the secondary subject, the woman, in relation to him (\"speaking to a woman,\" \"facing her\"). This follows the instructions for handling main and secondary subjects perfectly.\n\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as requested.",
