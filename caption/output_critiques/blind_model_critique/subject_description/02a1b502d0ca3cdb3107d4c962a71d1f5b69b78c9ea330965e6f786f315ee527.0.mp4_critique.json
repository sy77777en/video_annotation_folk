    "pre_caption": "The video features a pair of hands manipulating a deck of playing cards. The hands, with light skin tone, are actively engaged in holding and sorting through the cards, which include various suits such as hearts, spades, and diamonds. The cards are standard playing cards, with visible numbers and suit symbols. The hands are positioned centrally, focusing on the cards being held and shuffled. To the right, a stack of cards lies on a flat surface, with one card partially visible, showing a colorful design. The interaction between the hands and the cards is the primary focus, highlighting the act of card handling.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, skin color, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively identifies the primary subjects and action, but it could be enhanced with more specific visual details. For instance, while it mentions the hands are \"sorting,\" it misses the opportunity to describe the specific type of manipulation, such as fanning the cards in an arc or performing a riffle shuffle, which would be a key visual element. The description of the cards is also somewhat generic; mentioning a few specific, clearly visible cards, like the Queen of Hearts or the Ace of Spades, would provide a more concrete visual anchor. Furthermore, the description of the secondary stack of cards is vague; specifying the color and pattern of the \"colorful design,\" which is likely the back of the card (e.g., a blue, intricate filigree pattern), and identifying the \"flat surface\" (e.g., a green felt tabletop or a dark wood desk) would add important contextual detail. Finally, the last sentence is interpretive, explaining the video's focus rather than describing its content, and could be removed for greater conciseness and adherence to a purely descriptive style.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a pair of hands with light skin tone skillfully manipulating a deck of playing cards. The hands are seen fanning the cards in an arc and performing a riffle shuffle, demonstrating dexterity and precision. Among the cards, the Queen of Hearts and the Ace of Spades are prominently visible, adding a clear visual anchor. To the right, a stack of cards rests on a green felt tabletop, with one card partially visible, displaying a blue, intricate filigree pattern on its back. The focus remains on the detailed interaction between the hands and the cards.",
