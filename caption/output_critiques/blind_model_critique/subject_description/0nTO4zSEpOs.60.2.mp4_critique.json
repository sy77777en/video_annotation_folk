    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of people walking down a wide, tiled staircase in an urban setting at night. The individuals are wearing casual clothing, including jackets and pants, and all are wearing face masks. The lighting is artificial, suggesting a well-lit public area. The scene transitions to an empty view of the staircase and surrounding railings, highlighting the architectural elements like the tiled steps and metal railings. The setting appears to be a modern, urban environment with a focus on the structure and design of the staircase.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it correctly identifies the main subjects and the sequence of events, it fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily regarding the level of detail and specificity required.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**1. Lack of Completeness and Detail:**\n*   The biggest failure is the lack of detailed visual attributes for the subjects. The instructions explicitly ask for specifics like \"clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender,\" etc.\n*   The caption only provides a very general description: \"casual clothing, including jackets and pants.\" It does not mention any colors, specific styles (e.g., \"a blue hoodie,\" \"a black leather jacket\"), or any other distinguishing features of the individuals. This makes the description generic and less useful.\n*   Similarly, the description of the staircase (\"tiled steps and metal railings\") is minimal and could be more descriptive (e.g., \"gray square tiles,\" \"brushed steel railings\").\n\n**2. Poor Adherence to Specific Instructions:**\n*   **Shot Transitions:** The instructions state to note the \"type of transition (e.g., hard cut, soft transition).\" The caption mentions \"The scene transitions to...\" but fails to specify the type of transition.\n*   **Subject Identification:** The instructions ask for precise terms like \"man\" or \"woman.\" The caption uses the more general term \"people.\" While acceptable if gender is not discernible, it is less precise than the instructions demand.\n*   **Interpretive Language:** The caption uses phrases like \"suggesting a well-lit public area,\" \"appears to be a modern, urban environment,\" and \"highlighting the architectural elements.\" This is interpretive language that describes the effect or feeling of the scene rather than sticking to a direct, objective description of what is visible, which violates the instruction to \"avoid subjective adjectives\" and describe only what is visible.\n\n**3. Minor Inaccuracies in Tone:**\n*   The final sentence, \"...with a focus on the structure and design of the staircase,\" describes the perceived intent of the videographer, which is a form of subjective analysis that the instructions discourage.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a correct but superficial overview. It fails to meet the core requirement of providing a **concise yet informative description** with **detailed visual attributes**, making it a poor execution of the given instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a group of three individuals, two men and one woman, walking down a wide, tiled staircase in an urban setting at night. The first man, appearing to be in his late 20s, has light skin, short brown hair, and is wearing a black leather jacket with dark jeans. The second man, also in his late 20s, has medium skin, a short beard, and is dressed in a gray hoodie and blue jeans. The woman, in her early 30s, has dark skin, long braided hair, and is wearing a red coat with black pants. All are wearing face masks. The lighting is bright and artificial, illuminating the area. The scene transitions with a soft fade to an empty view of the staircase, showcasing the gray square tiles and brushed steel railings. The setting is a modern urban environment, focusing on the staircase's architectural details.",
