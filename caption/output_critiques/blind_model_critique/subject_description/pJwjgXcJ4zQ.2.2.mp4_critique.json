    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption accurately describes a typical cityscape scene. It correctly identifies the key components: tall buildings, a narrow street, colorful signs, traffic cones, and people. The overall impression of a \"bustling\" and \"dynamic\" urban environment is a logical and accurate interpretation of these elements combined.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete for a scenery shot. It doesn't focus on any single person or object in detail, which is correct because the instructions state that for scenery shots, the focus should be on the environment and atmosphere. It provides enough detail (e.g., \"orange traffic cones,\" \"colorful signs\") to paint a clear picture without getting lost in specifics.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and, crucially, follows the specific instruction to explain *why* there is no main subject: \"The emphasis is on the environment and the lively ambiance rather than any specific object or individual.\" This shows a perfect understanding of the rule.\n    *   **Conciseness and Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English. It avoids Markdown and introductory text.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\" While it uses adjectives like \"vibrant\" and \"bustling,\" these are used appropriately to describe the overall \"atmosphere,\" which is permitted for scenery shots, rather than conveying subjective emotions about a specific subject.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"buildings,\" \"street,\" \"traffic cones,\" and \"people.\"\n    *   **Holistic View:** The description synthesizes the entire scene into one cohesive summary without referring to specific moments in time.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the instructions, particularly the nuanced rule for describing a scenery shot. It is accurate, concise, and follows every constraint perfectly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a vibrant cityscape, capturing an urban environment with towering buildings flanking a narrow street. The scene is alive with colorful signs and advertisements adorning the buildings, reflecting the bustling energy of city life. Orange traffic cones line the street, and the presence of people walking adds to the dynamic urban setting. The focus remains on the lively atmosphere and environment, rather than any specific object or individual.",
