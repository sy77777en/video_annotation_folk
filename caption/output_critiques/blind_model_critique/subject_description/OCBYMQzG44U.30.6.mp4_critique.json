    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a disorienting, low-angle view looking up a vast, tiled wall. The wall, made of small, pale green tiles, is dotted with numerous identical, small rectangular windows that are brightly illuminated from within. A long, intensely bright light fixture runs along the top of the frame, casting a sterile, hazy glow over the scene and creating a sense of immense height. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the overwhelming scale and repetitive, minimalist pattern of the environment, which evokes a sterile and surreal atmosphere rather than highlighting a specific object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies this as an architectural scenery shot and captures the general composition, it misses several key visual details and violates some core instructions. The description uses subjective, atmospheric words like \"disorienting,\" \"sterile,\" and \"surreal,\" which should be replaced with objective visual descriptions; for instance, instead of \"disorienting,\" you could describe how the extreme low-angle perspective warps the geometry of the wall. The caption also uses the forbidden term \"frame,\" which could be rephrased as \"at the top of the view.\" Furthermore, several specific attributes I observed are missing: the pale green tiles had a distinct glossy finish, causing subtle, elongated reflections of the windows to streak down the wall. The dark gray grout between the tiles was also a prominent feature, creating a strong grid that defined the repetitive pattern. The light from the windows and the overhead fixture was not just bright but had a cold, blue-white color temperature. Finally, the video was not static but featured a slow, continuous upward tilt of the camera, an essential detail that reinforces the sense of immense scale you mentioned. Incorporating these specific, objective details would create a more accurate and compliant description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This architectural scenery shot captures a low-angle view looking up a vast, tiled wall. The wall is composed of small, pale green tiles with a glossy finish, creating subtle, elongated reflections of the windows that streak down the surface. The dark gray grout between the tiles forms a strong grid, emphasizing the repetitive pattern. Numerous identical, small rectangular windows are brightly illuminated from within, emitting a cold, blue-white light. At the top of the view, a long, intensely bright light fixture casts a similar cold glow over the scene. The extreme low-angle perspective warps the geometry of the wall, enhancing the sense of immense height.
