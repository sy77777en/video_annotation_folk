    "pre_caption": "This is a coastal scenery shot that presents a layered view of the sea from a rocky shoreline. A large, dark rock with patches of yellow lichen dominates the right foreground, creating a natural frame for the scene beyond. The midground features the dark, choppy sea, with several smaller, seaweed-covered rocks breaking the surface. In the distance, a prominent, pale, dome-shaped island sits on the horizon beneath a cloudy, overcast sky. The video lacks a distinct main subject; instead, the focus is on the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural environment. The static composition emphasizes the rugged texture of the rocks, the vastness of the water, and the imposing presence of the distant island.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main components of the coastal scenery, it misses the dynamic interplay of light and motion that defines the video's atmosphere. The description of the sea as \"dark\" and \"choppy\" is an oversimplification; the water is actually a deep teal color, and the \"choppiness\" manifests as rhythmic, swelling waves that crash into white foam against the midground rocks, with their glistening, dark green seaweed swaying in the current. The caption also describes the composition as \"static,\" which, while true for the camera, overlooks the significant movement within the frame; the clouds are not just \"overcast\" but are visibly drifting, causing subtle shifts in light that dapple across the water's surface. Furthermore, the \"pale, dome-shaped island\" is not just a flat shape but has a faint, rocky texture visible even from a distance, and a few small, white gulls can be seen circling near its peak, adding a sense of scale and life that the current description omits. A more effective caption would incorporate these details of movement, light, and subtle life to better convey the rugged, living quality of the landscape.",
