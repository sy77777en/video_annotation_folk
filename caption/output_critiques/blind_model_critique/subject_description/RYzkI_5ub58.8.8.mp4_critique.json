    "pre_caption": "A lizard is shown in a close-up, facing directly towards the viewer. Its skin is covered in small, rough scales, exhibiting a mottled pattern of gray, brown, and possibly some greenish hues. The scales on its chin and neck are lighter, appearing almost white or very light gray with darker speckles, while the scales on the top of its head are a more uniform brownish-gray. The lizard has dark, round pupils set within lighter irises. Its head is somewhat triangular from this frontal view, with a noticeable V-shaped ridge or crest running from between its eyes towards the back of its head, and pronounced brow ridges above the eyes. The scales around its chin and neck appear slightly raised or spiky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes the lizard's physical characteristics, including the texture and mottled color pattern of its scales, the specific coloration on its chin and head, the appearance of its eyes, and the distinct V-shaped crest and brow ridges on its head.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very thorough. It covers the subject's type (\"lizard\"), orientation (\"facing directly towards the viewer\"), and a comprehensive list of its key visual attributes (scales, color, pattern, head shape, specific facial features). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental image of the subject.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown formatting.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is clear, direct, and focuses entirely on descriptive details without unnecessary words.\n    *   **Vocabulary:** It correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It uses objective, descriptive language (\"small, rough scales,\" \"mottled pattern\") instead of subjective, emotional adjectives. It appropriately handles uncertainty with the phrase \"possibly some greenish hues.\"\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subject with the precise term \"lizard.\"\n    *   **Focus:** As the video features a single, salient subject in a close-up, the caption correctly focuses all its detail on describing that subject. It does not mention the background, as instructed.",
