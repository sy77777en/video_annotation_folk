    "pre_caption": "The video features a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small portion of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right corner, showing a dark, angular structure with illuminated elements. As the vehicle descends, it becomes fully visible, revealing a sleek, futuristic design with glowing red and blue lights. The vehicle's surface appears metallic and reflective, with distinct geometric shapes. The video concludes with a wide shot of the vehicle resting on the platform, surrounded by beams of light and other space structures, emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a flying vehicle landing on a platform in space. Initially, only a small part of the vehicle is visible in the upper-right part of the frame. As the vehicle descends, it is fully gradually revealed, and the shot ends with a wide shot of the vehicle on the platform.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good, but it has a few minor issues that prevent it from perfectly adhering to all instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"flying vehicle\" and describes its actions—descending and landing on a platform. The visual details mentioned, such as its \"dark, angular structure,\" \"glowing red and blue lights,\" and \"metallic and reflective\" surface, are precise and reflect what would be seen in such a video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully describes the entire sequence of the video, from the vehicle's initial partial appearance to its final resting state. It provides a holistic view by combining details from the beginning, middle, and end of the action, effectively summarizing the visual narrative.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows most of the instructions well, but it fails on one key point.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Format and Structure:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is clear and provides an informative description without being overly wordy.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses a precise term, \"flying vehicle,\" and focuses the description on this main subject.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It successfully describes the video's progression (\"Initially...\", \"As the vehicle descends...\", \"The video concludes...\") without using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific visual attributes like \"dark, angular structure,\" \"illuminated elements,\" and \"glowing red and blue lights.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:** The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to avoid describing what is not visible. The caption violates this rule with the following words and phrases:\n    *   **\"sleek\" and \"futuristic\":** These are subjective interpretations of the vehicle's design style, not objective visual attributes. More objective descriptions would focus on its shape, such as \"smooth-surfaced\" or \"having sharp, clean lines.\"\n    *   **\"...emphasizing its advanced technology and the vastness of the space environment\":** This final clause is a major violation. It describes the *intended effect* or *interpretation* of the scene rather than the visual facts. The instruction is to describe what is seen, not the feeling it evokes or the concepts it represents. A better, more objective ending would be: \"The video concludes with a wide shot of the vehicle resting on the platform, surrounded by beams of light and other distant space structures.\"",
