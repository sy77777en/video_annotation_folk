    "pre_caption": "This is a wide, static cityscape scenery shot of a grand, classical-style building. The symmetrical, light-stone structure features a prominent central clock tower and is viewed from across a vast, empty, sandy courtyard under a partly cloudy sky. The composition lacks a specific main subject, as the focus is on capturing the impressive scale and historical atmosphere of the architectural environment itself. The wide perspective emphasizes the building's grandeur and its place within the larger setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption correctly identifies the primary subject as a classical building with a clock tower and notes the forward camera movement. However, it relies on subjective and technical terms like \"grand,\" \"impressive,\" and \"extreme wide shot,\" which should be replaced with more objective, visual descriptions. The description of the building as a \"light-stone structure\" is too general; in the video, I saw specific details that are missing, such as the tall, fluted Corinthian columns flanking the main entrance, the series of large arched windows on the second story, and the intricate stone carvings of wreaths and figures above the entryway. The caption also states the courtyard is \"empty,\" but I observed several dark green, cast-iron benches and a few ornate, black lampposts scattered across the sandy ground, which are important secondary elements. Furthermore, while the sky is \"partly cloudy,\" the caption fails to mention the distinct, long shadows cast by the building, suggesting the low angle of a late afternoon sun, which significantly affects the visual texture of the scene. The video clearly has a salient subject—the building—so it should be described in detail as such, rather than being framed as a general scenery shot.",

The light-stone structure is detailed with tall, fluted Corinthian columns flanking the main entrance, a series of large arched windows on the second story, and intricate stone carvings of wreaths and figures above the entryway. The courtyard features several dark green, cast-iron benches and a few ornate, black lampposts scattered across the ground. The partly cloudy sky casts distinct, long shadows from the building, indicating the low angle of a late afternoon sun, which enhances the visual texture of the scene.
