    "pre_caption": "The video features a matte blue sports car, viewed from a camera mounted on its front hood looking back towards the windshield. Inside the car, two people are visible from the chest up, both wearing helmets. The person in the driver's seat wears a multicolored helmet with prominent yellow, blue, and red sections. The person in the passenger seat wears what appears to be a white helmet. A second sports car, which is silver or grey, appears on the right. This car is distinguished by a large black rear wing and has its headlights on.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video starts with a medium shot of the car. The camera is fixed at the front of the car, capturing two people inside, with only their heads visible. The car then overtakes another sports car, which is fully visible on the right.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the primary subjects and their basic attributes, but it lacks the dynamic context and specific details that are prominent in the video. The description of the cars as simply a \"matte blue sports car\" and a \"silver or grey\" one is too generic; the video clearly shows the first car is a glossy, vibrant blue Porsche 911, and the second is a metallic silver McLaren, identifiable by its unique teardrop-shaped cockpit and side air intakes. The caption mentions the silver car \"appears on the right,\" but this understates the action, which is a high-speed overtaking maneuver happening on a sunlit professional racetrack, with red and white curbing visible along the edge of the track. Furthermore, while the helmets are mentioned, more specific details are visible: the driver's \"multicolored\" helmet features a distinct geometric pattern with sponsor logos, and the passenger's plain white helmet has a dark, tinted visor. The description should incorporate the action and setting to convey the video's purpose, for example, by describing the two sports cars dueling for position on a racetrack, and it should use the more specific, identifiable features of the vehicles and gear to create a more accurate and vivid picture.",
