    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, focusing on the immense scale and atmosphere of an approaching storm rather than a specific main subject. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky, where lighter, wispy blue and white clouds in the upper atmosphere give way to a massive, dark, and ominous storm cloud that stretches across the lower half of the sky. This deep blue-black cloud formation hangs low over the horizon, from which a concentrated column of rain can be seen falling in the distance. Below, a flat expanse of green farmland, marked by faint rows leading toward the storm, meets a horizon glowing with a soft orange light, creating a stark contrast with the dark weather system above. The shot's emphasis is on the powerful environmental display, capturing the feeling of being in the presence of a significant weather event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption does an excellent job of describing the static composition and atmospheric contrast, it misses the opportunity to convey the dynamic nature inherent in a video of an approaching storm. The description could be improved by incorporating the movement of the clouds, perhaps mentioning their visible rotation or the way they boil and expand, which would better justify the term \"turbulent.\" The video likely shows the \"concentrated column of rain\" not as a fixed object but as a rain shaft actively sweeping across the green farmland, an important detail of motion that is currently absent. Furthermore, for a truly \"dramatic\" and \"ominous\" storm, the video might feature more specific and threatening cloud structures, like a low, menacing shelf cloud at the leading edge of the storm, which is a more precise and evocative detail than a generic \"dark cloud formation.\" Lastly, the description omits any mention of lightning, which would almost certainly be a key visual in a video of this nature, with flashes intermittently illuminating the dark cloud mass from within and adding to the powerful environmental display.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures the dynamic and dramatic essence of an approaching storm, emphasizing the immense scale and atmospheric tension. The composition is dominated by a vast, turbulent sky, where lighter, wispy blue and white clouds in the upper atmosphere give way to a massive, dark, and ominous storm cloud. This cloud formation, featuring a menacing shelf cloud at its leading edge, stretches across the lower half of the sky, visibly rotating and boiling as it expands.
