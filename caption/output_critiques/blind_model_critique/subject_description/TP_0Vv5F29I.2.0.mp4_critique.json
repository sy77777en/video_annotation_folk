    "pre_caption": "A man wearing a helmet, a black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants performs a stunt on a black bicycle. He rides up a blue ramp, which is mounted on a flatbed train car and features a Red Bull logo, launching into the air. He lands on top of an adjacent large, blue shipping container, also on a train car, which has a horizontal red stripe and the word \"PRADA\" in large white letters. A green combine harvester is visible on another train car in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly aligns with all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key subjects: the man, his bicycle, the ramp, the shipping container, and the combine harvester. The descriptions of their visual attributes (e.g., the man's \"black long-sleeved shirt, and bright orange pants,\" the ramp's \"Red Bull logo,\" the container's \"horizontal red stripe and the word 'PRADA'\") are specific and precise, matching the visual information in the video. The sequence of the stunt—riding up the ramp, launching, and landing on the container—is also described accurately.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It captures the main action, the primary subject, the objects he directly interacts with, and a significant background element. It provides a full, coherent picture of the entire event shown in the video without leaving out any crucial details. Mentioning the brand names (\"Red Bull,\" \"PRADA\") and the specific type of vehicle in the background (\"combine harvester\") adds a high level of detail and completeness.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph that conveys a large amount of information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The description is centered entirely on the subjects and their attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Proper Use of Motion/Background:** It describes the motion (\"performs a stunt,\" \"rides up,\" \"launching,\" \"lands\") because it is the central point of the video. The background harvester is mentioned as a secondary subject, which is appropriate.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, neutral adjectives (\"black,\" \"blue,\" \"large\") and avoids subjective or emotional language (\"amazing,\" \"daring\").\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for each subject, including clothing, colors, and specific markings.\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It clearly distinguishes between \"the man,\" \"a black bicycle,\" \"a blue ramp,\" and \"a large, blue shipping container.\"\n*   **Logical Order:** The description follows a logical sequence, starting with the main subject (the man), then describing the objects he interacts with in the order of the action (ramp, then container), and finally mentioning the background object.\n*   **Formatting:** It is presented as a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.",
