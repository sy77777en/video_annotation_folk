    "pre_caption": "A close-up, stylized view from inside a vehicle highlights a black, vertical bar, likely part of a roll cage. The bar has a textured surface with a visible seam of stitching running down its length. The shot is framed by the dark, out-of-focus shapes of the car's interior, possibly the seats or pillars, which have a strong green tint. Through the car's windows, the outside is a bright, overexposed white expanse. A small, glowing orange interior light is visible in the background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres almost perfectly to the given instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is extremely accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements: the black vertical bar with its textured surface and stitching, the out-of-focus green-tinted interior shapes, the bright, overexposed exterior visible through the windows, and the small orange light. The description of these elements is precise and true to the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures the main subject (the bar) in detail while also including the surrounding elements that define the scene's context and composition. It successfully creates a comprehensive mental image of the static shot.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and informative, as instructed. The language is simple and natural.\n*   **Subject Focus and Attributes:** It correctly focuses on describing the subjects (\"vertical bar,\" \"car's interior,\" \"interior light\") and their specific visual attributes (color, texture, shape, lighting) in great detail.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It uses \"background\" appropriately to specify the location of the light, which is permitted by the instructions.\n*   **Handling Ambiguity:** The caption uses \"likely part of a roll cage\" and \"possibly the seats or pillars.\" While the instructions say to avoid describing what you are unsure about, they also allow for using \"best judgment\" for ambiguous subjects. Using cautious phrasing like \"likely\" and \"possibly\" is an excellent way to handle this ambiguity without making an unverified claim, thus adhering to the spirit of the rule.\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids subjective emotional adjectives. The word \"stylized\" is used, but in this context, it functions as an objective descriptor of the shot's technical qualities (shallow depth of field, specific color grading) rather than an emotional opinion.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is of high quality and effectively fulfills all the requirements of the prompt. It demonstrates a strong understanding of how to translate visual information into a descriptive, objective, and well-structured text according to a complex set of rules. There are no significant errors or deviations from the instructions.",
