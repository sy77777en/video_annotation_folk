    "pre_caption": "The video features two main subjects. The first is a large, humanoid figure with a dark, shadowy appearance, glowing blue eyes, and a fragmented, block-like structure. This figure has an imposing presence and appears to be constructed from angular, black shapes. The second subject is a smaller, fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic. This creature is positioned near the larger figure, highlighting a stark contrast in size and form. Both subjects exhibit a stylized, animated design, contributing to their atypical and striking appearances.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nKeep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Only mention the background or motion if necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. Use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is very good, but it has one minor flaw regarding adherence to the instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two subjects as a \"large, humanoid figure\" and a \"smaller, fox-like creature,\" which are appropriate and precise descriptions for these stylized characters. The visual attributes are described with excellent accuracy, including the figure's \"dark, shadowy appearance, glowing blue eyes, and a fragmented, block-like structure,\" and the creature's \"orange fur,\" \"bushy tail,\" and \"green tunic.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully captures the most essential details of both subjects, their relationship to each other (\"positioned near the larger figure\"), and their overall design style (\"stylized, animated design\"). It provides enough information for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to the vast majority of the instructions exceptionally well.\n    *   It is a concise, single paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   It focuses entirely on the subjects and their visual attributes.\n    *   It correctly avoids mentioning frames, images, background details, or speculation.\n    *   It logically prioritizes the larger, more dominant figure before describing the smaller one.\n\n    However, it slightly violates one rule:\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the words **\"imposing\"** and **\"striking.\"** While \"imposing\" can be argued as a description of physical presence, \"striking\" is purely subjective, as it describes the effect the appearance has on the viewer. A more objective caption would describe the features that make the subjects striking without using the word itself.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its accuracy, clarity, and structure. Its only weakness is the use of a couple of subjective adjectives, which goes against a specific negative constraint in the instructions. By removing or rephrasing these words, the caption would be perfect.",

The first is a large, humanoid figure with a dark, shadowy appearance, glowing blue eyes, and a fragmented, block-like structure.

The second subject is a smaller, fox-like creature with orange fur and a bushy tail, wearing a green tunic.

Both subjects exhibit a stylized, animated design, contributing to their unique and memorable appearances.",
