    "pre_caption": "This video presents a sweeping aerial cityscape scenery shot of Venice, Italy, captured during a golden sunset. The camera glides down the Grand Canal, moving towards the iconic, white stone Rialto Bridge with its distinct arches. The city's dense architecture, characterized by buildings with red-tiled roofs, is bathed in the warm, low-angled light of the setting sun. On the dark green water of the canal, several long, white water buses (vaporettos) are docked or moving, alongside smaller motorboats and gondolas. There is no single main subject in this shot. The focus is instead on conveying the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the entire urban landscape, emphasizing the unique interplay of historic architecture, water, and light that defines the city.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as an aerial scenery shot of Venice at sunset and follows the instruction to explain the absence of a single main subject, it could be improved by adhering more strictly to objective description and including more specific visual details. The caption uses subjective and interpretive language such as \"iconic,\" \"warm,\" \"grand scale,\" and \"atmospheric beauty,\" which should be replaced with more neutral, descriptive terms; for example, \"warm light\" could be described as \"low-angled golden light.\" The description of the boats is too general; imagining the video, the gondolas are likely their traditional slender, black shape, and some gondoliers in striped shirts might be discernible. Similarly, the vaporettos might have visible company logos or colors, and the buildings, beyond their red-tiled roofs, likely display a palette of ochre, yellow, and faded pastel facades that would add valuable detail. The final two sentences are overly analytical; the reason for the lack of a main subject is evident from the description of a wide, moving aerial shot, so the explanation could be condensed to a single, more direct statement. Finally, the introductory phrase \"This video presents\" is unnecessary and should be omitted to create a more direct and immersive description.",
