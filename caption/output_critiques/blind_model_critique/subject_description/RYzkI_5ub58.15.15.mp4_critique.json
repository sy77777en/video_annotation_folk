    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of birds perched on and around leafless tree branches. The birds are predominantly white with some darker markings, and they vary in size. They are scattered across the branches, with some standing on the ground below. The scene is set in a natural environment with dense greenery in the background, suggesting a forested area. The birds appear to be at rest, with a few in mid-flight or adjusting their positions on the branches.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the main subjects and their actions but violates a few key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be an accurate description of the video's content. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"birds\" and \"leafless tree branches\" and describes their visual attributes (\"predominantly white with some darker markings\") and states (\"perched,\" \"on the ground,\" \"in mid-flight\").\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is reasonably complete. It covers the type of subjects, their appearance, their distribution within the scene, and their various actions, giving a comprehensive overview of the video's content. It correctly follows the instruction to describe the subjects collectively as a group since there is no single main focus.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some significant issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"birds,\" \"tree branches\") instead of vague ones.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides good visual details for the birds (color, size) and the tree (leafless branches).\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective adjectives that convey emotion.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Forbidden Words:** It correctly avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where it fails to adhere:**\n*   **Describing the Background:** The most significant violation is the inclusion of the background description: \"The scene is set in a natural environment with dense greenery in the background, suggesting a forested area.\" The instruction explicitly states, **\"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships.\"** The background greenery does not help distinguish one bird from another; it only adds environmental context, which the instructions forbid.\n*   **Using Interpretive Language:** The phrase \"suggesting a forested area\" is an interpretation, not a direct observation. The instruction states, **\"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"** Sticking to observable facts (\"dense greenery is in the background\") would be better, but omitting the background altogether would be correct.\n*   **Redundant Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\" While not explicitly forbidden, it is redundant. The instructions favor direct, concise descriptions. A better start would be \"A group of birds is perched...\" to get straight to the subject matter.",
