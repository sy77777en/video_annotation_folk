The focus is on the sterile, liminal environment itself, creating a sense of quiet desolation rather than centering on a specific character or object. The long corridor features beige walls, an orange carpet littered with scattered papers, and a ceiling with recessed fluorescent lights. White doors are marked with numbers, such as '448' and '449', and a large window on the left wall offers a glimpse into an adjacent, dimly lit office space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the scene as an office hallway, but it misses several key visual details and relies on subjective interpretation. It uses terms like \"sterile\" and \"liminal,\" which are analytical rather than descriptive. A more accurate description would note the visual elements that create this atmosphere, such as the slight, almost imperceptible flicker in the rearmost fluorescent light and the slow, steady dolly shot that moves forward down the length of the corridor. The description of \"scattered papers\" is too general; the video shows that the papers are a mix of loose printed documents and two distinct, overturned manila folders, with most of the clutter concentrated in front of the door marked '449'. Furthermore, the caption is inaccurate in stating there are windows on \"both sides of the wall.\" The video clearly shows the large windows are only on the left wall, and through one of them, an overturned office chair is visible next to a desk with a dark computer monitor, a specific and unsettling detail that is entirely omitted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a long, empty office hallway, emphasizing its quiet desolation. The corridor features beige walls and an orange carpet, with scattered papers that include loose printed documents and two overturned manila folders, mostly concentrated in front of the door marked '449'. The ceiling is lined with recessed fluorescent lights, with a slight flicker noticeable in the rearmost one. The camera moves forward in a slow, steady dolly shot, enhancing the eerie atmosphere. White doors are marked with numbers like '448' and '449'. Large windows are only on the left wall, offering a view into an adjacent, dimly lit office space where an overturned office chair sits next to a desk with a dark computer monitor, adding to the unsettling scene.",
