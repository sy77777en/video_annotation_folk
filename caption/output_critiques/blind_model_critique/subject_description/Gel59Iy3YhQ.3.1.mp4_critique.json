White doors are marked with numbers, such as '448' and '449', and a large window on the left wall offers a glimpse into an adjacent, dimly lit office space.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate in its description of the physical scene. It details specific, verifiable elements such as an \"office hallway,\" \"beige walls,\" an \"orange carpet littered with scattered papers,\" \"recessed fluorescent lights,\" and \"white doors\" with specific numbers like \"448\" and \"449.\" These details suggest a precise and factual representation of the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete for a video that is a scenery shot. It successfully identifies that there is no main subject and instead focuses on the environment. It covers all the major visual components of the hallway—walls, floor, ceiling, doors, and a window—providing a comprehensive overview of the setting.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres to many of the instructions, but it fails on one critical point.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description of the physical space is clear and easy to understand.\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"scenery shot\" and follows the specific instruction to explain why there is no main subject: \"The focus is on the... environment itself... rather than centering on a specific character or object.\"\n*   **Object Description:** It provides excellent, specific visual attributes for the objects in the scene (e.g., \"orange carpet,\" \"white doors are marked with numbers\").\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The primary failure is the violation of the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses several subjective and interpretive words to describe the atmosphere, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   **\"sterile\"**: This is an interpretation of the environment's quality, not a direct visual attribute.\n    *   **\"liminal\"**: This is a highly abstract and subjective concept describing a transitional state, not a visual fact.\n    *   **\"a sense of quiet desolation\"**: This phrase directly describes an emotional mood and atmosphere, which is a clear violation of the instruction.\n\nIn summary, while the caption is excellent at describing the physical, objective reality of the scene and follows most structural rules, it fails significantly by including subjective, emotional, and interpretive language (\"sterile,\" \"liminal,\" \"quiet desolation\") instead of sticking strictly to visual facts.",
