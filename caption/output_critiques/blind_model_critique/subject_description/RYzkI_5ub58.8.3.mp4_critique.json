    "pre_caption": "A close-up, macro view shows a weevil resting on a bright green leaf. The insect has a dark, textured body with a mottled pattern of yellowish-gold scales, particularly on its head and thorax. A long, dark snout, or rostrum, extends downward from its head. On either side of the head are large, dark, compound eyes. A pair of elbowed antennae with clubbed ends protrudes from the snout. The weevil's dark, segmented legs are visible, positioned on the surface of the leaf.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"weevil\" and uses precise entomological terms like \"rostrum,\" \"thorax,\" \"compound eyes,\" and \"elbowed antennae\" to describe its features. The descriptions of color (\"dark,\" \"yellowish-gold scales\"), texture (\"textured body,\" \"mottled pattern\"), and posture (\"resting,\" \"extends downward\") are specific and fact-based.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It covers all the salient visual details of the subject as required by the instructions. It describes the insect's body, head, snout, eyes, antennae, and legs, as well as its color, pattern, and texture. It also includes the immediate context of the \"bright green leaf\" on which the weevil is resting, which is essential for a full picture.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to the given rules.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph that provides a wealth of information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered entirely on the weevil and its immediate location (the leaf), avoiding any mention of the wider background.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The language is objective and descriptive (e.g., \"dark, textured body,\" \"large, dark, compound eyes\") and avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise subject types (\"weevil,\" \"insect,\" \"leaf\") and avoids vague terms.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.\n*   **No Meta-Commentary:** It successfully avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and synthesizes the information into a holistic description of the scene. The opening phrase \"A close-up, macro view shows\" is an effective and natural way to establish the shot's perspective without violating the spirit of the instructions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the instructions perfectly. It is accurate, detailed, and written in clear, objective language. It successfully balances the need for conciseness with the requirement for detailed visual attributes, resulting in a description that allows a reader to form a precise mental image of the video's content.",
