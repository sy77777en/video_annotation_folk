    "pre_caption": "The video opens on the rear of a large, gray rhinoceros with thick, folded skin as it walks away from the camera toward the right side of an enclosure. As the rhinoceros moves, the camera pans to the left, revealing a second, similar-looking rhinoceros standing still on the left side of the enclosure. This second rhinoceros is also large and gray with wrinkled skin and is positioned facing toward the right. The enclosure features a small, muddy pool of water, large rocks, and several sprinklers spraying water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately captures the basic sequence of events, but it could be enhanced with more specific details that appear in the video. For instance, the subjects are clearly white rhinoceroses, identifiable by their broad, square lips and the prominent hump on their necks, a detail the caption omits. The description of \"thick, folded skin\" is good, but it fails to mention their most prominent feature: their horns. The first rhinoceros, walking away, has two horns with the larger front one showing noticeable wear at the tip, while the second, stationary rhinoceros has a slightly smaller, more pointed front horn. The caption also separates the subjects from their environment. In the video, the first rhinoceros is walking directly toward the muddy pool, and the mist from the sprinklers is visibly dampening its gray hide. The second rhinoceros isn't just \"standing still\"; it's positioned near the large rocks and occasionally twitches its large, funnel-shaped ears. Finally, after the camera pans left, it holds on a wider shot that frames both animals, showing the walking rhino approaching the water on the right and the stationary one observing from the left, establishing a clear spatial relationship between them that the current description doesn't fully convey.",
