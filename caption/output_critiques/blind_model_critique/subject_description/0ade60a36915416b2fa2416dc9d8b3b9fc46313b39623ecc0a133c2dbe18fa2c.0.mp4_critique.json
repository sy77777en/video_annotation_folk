    "pre_caption": "The video features two prominent celestial bodies. The first is a reddish-brown planet with a textured surface, characterized by craters and dark patches, indicative of Mars. Accompanying it is a small, irregularly shaped gray object resembling an asteroid or moon.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but has a few clear violations of the instructions that prevent it from being excellent.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as two distinct celestial bodies, likely Mars and Earth, based on their described visual attributes (\"reddish-brown planet with craters\" and \"vibrant blue and green planet... with swirling white cloud formations\"). The description of the small, gray companion object is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description of the subjects' visual attributes is thorough and informative. It provides specific details about color, texture, and key features (craters, clouds) for each planet.\n*   It correctly notes the presence of a transition between the two scenes.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The instructions suggest noting the *type* of transition (e.g., hard cut, soft transition). The caption mentions that a transition occurs but does not specify its nature, making it slightly less complete than it could be.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It successfully combines details from the entire sequence without referring to specific frames.\n    *   It uses precise terms (\"planet,\" \"asteroid or moon\") and avoids vague language.\n    *   It describes subjects in the order of their appearance.\n    *   It avoids overly subjective or emotional language.\n\n*   **Violations:**\n    1.  **Use of Forbidden Terms:** The instructions state to \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" While not explicitly listed, \"video\" falls into this category of self-referential terms describing the medium. The caption uses the word \"video\" twice (\"The video features...\", \"The video transitions...\"), which is a direct violation of this rule.\n    2.  **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The instructions state to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The phrase \"The video features...\" is considered introductory text and should have been omitted for a more direct description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption provides an accurate and well-detailed description of the visual content. However, it fails to fully adhere to the stylistic and formatting constraints of the instructions by including the forbidden word \"video\" and starting with an introductory phrase. While the core description is strong, these violations make it a \"good\" but not \"perfect\" caption according to the rules provided.",
