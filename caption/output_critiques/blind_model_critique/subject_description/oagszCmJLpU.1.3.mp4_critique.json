    "pre_caption": "This video captures a dramatic landscape scenery shot, depicting a vast, flat plain of green and yellow grass under an immense, turbulent sky. The scene is dominated by massive, dark grey storm clouds that swirl and gather, with curtains of rain visibly falling in the distance. A single, small tree stands alone in the middle of the expansive field, appearing small and isolated against the powerful backdrop. The primary focus is on the powerful, ominous atmosphere and the sheer scale of the natural environment, rather than on a specific subject, using the lone tree to emphasize the vastness of the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the scene's dramatic and atmospheric tone, but it overlooks several key dynamic and textural elements from the video. While it correctly identifies the swirling storm clouds, it fails to mention the dramatic play of light, such as the occasional shafts of sunlight that pierce the dark cloud cover to illuminate patches of the golden-green field below. The description of motion is also understated; the video is clearly a time-lapse, showing the clouds boiling and racing across the sky at an accelerated pace, a detail crucial for conveying the storm's power. Furthermore, the description of the \"single, small tree\" is too generic; in the video, it is a gnarled, windswept oak, its bare branches thrashing violently against the wind, which also sends visible, fast-moving waves rippling across the entire expanse of grass. Including these specifics about the time-lapsed motion, the dramatic lighting, and the tree's specific form and reaction to the wind would more accurately reflect the video's powerful and dynamic content.",
