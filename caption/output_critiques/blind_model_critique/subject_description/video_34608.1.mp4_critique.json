    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot featuring a vast mountain range shrouded in a thick blanket of white clouds. Lush green forests cover the slopes of the mountains in the foreground, which are partially obscured by rolling fog. In the distance, the dark, sharp peaks of taller mountains pierce through the sea of clouds under a pale, overcast sky. There is no main subject in this video; the focus is instead on capturing the serene and majestic atmosphere of the high-altitude environment, emphasizing the immense scale of the landscape and the ethereal quality of the clouds enveloping it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the scene as a landscape shot without a primary subject, but it relies heavily on subjective and somewhat generic adjectives like \"vast,\" \"lush,\" \"serene,\" and \"majestic,\" which the instructions advise against. The description could be improved by incorporating more specific, objective details that might be visible. For instance, instead of a \"pale, overcast sky,\" the video might show subtle gradients of color, such as soft pinks or oranges near the horizon characteristic of a sunrise, which would be a key detail to include. The \"dark, sharp peaks\" could be described with more texture, such as being \"rocky and craggy, with patches of snow in their crevices,\" and their color might not be uniformly dark if they are catching direct sunlight. Similarly, the \"thick blanket of white clouds\" could be more dynamically described as an \"undulating sea of clouds\" to better capture the motion implied by \"rolling fog.\" Finally, the concluding sentence explaining the lack of a main subject is a bit long-winded; this point could be made more concisely by letting the detailed description of the expansive environment itself convey the focus on scale and atmosphere without explicitly stating it.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A landscape video captures a mountain range enveloped in an undulating sea of clouds. The slopes in the foreground are covered with green forests, partially hidden by rolling fog. In the distance, rocky and craggy peaks, with patches of snow in their crevices, rise through the clouds, catching the light in varying shades. The sky above features subtle gradients of soft pinks and oranges near the horizon, suggesting a sunrise. The video emphasizes the expansive and ethereal quality of this high-altitude environment.",
