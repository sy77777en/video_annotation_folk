    "pre_caption": "This video provides a point-of-view shot from a race car, focusing on the vehicle and its driver. The car is an open-wheel, formula-style racer with a light blue and silver body. The front wheels and suspension are exposed. On the blue section of the car's body, in front of the cockpit, the words \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" are written in white. The driver is seated in the open cockpit, wearing a white racing suit with red and black details, black gloves, and a black helmet that covers their entire head. Their hands are visible on the steering wheel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The camera is mounted on the race car, filming the driver from an angle above them, with both the driver and the car roughly half visible, along with a wide shot of the scenery.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the primary subjects, but it lacks the dynamic detail expected from a POV racing video. A significant omission is the steering wheel itself; in a formula-style car, this is a complex piece of equipment with a central digital display showing telemetry, numerous colorful buttons, and dials, all of which would be in sharp focus. The description of the driver is also static; it should mention their actions, such as turning the wheel through corners or using the paddle shifters, which would be the main activity in the video. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention any other cars on the track, which are critical secondary subjects that provide the context of a race. The description of the car's livery as \"light blue and silver\" is vague; specifying the pattern (e.g., \"a silver nose cone with a light blue main chassis\") would be more informative. Lastly, the black helmet would likely feature sponsor logos or a unique design, which are important distinguishing attributes for a driver.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video offers an exhilarating point-of-view shot from a race car, immersing viewers in the high-speed action of a formula-style race. The car, with a striking silver nose cone and a light blue main chassis, showcases its open-wheel design with exposed front wheels and suspension. Prominently displayed on the blue section in front of the cockpit are the words \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" in bold white letters. The driver, clad in a white racing suit with red and black accents, maneuvers the car with precision, their black-gloved hands deftly turning the wheel through sharp corners and skillfully operating the paddle shifters. The black helmet, adorned with sponsor logos and a unique design, adds to the driver's distinctive appearance. The steering wheel, a complex piece of equipment, features a central digital display showing vital telemetry, surrounded by an array of colorful buttons and dials, all in sharp focus. As the car races down the track, other competitors can be seen, adding to the thrilling context of the race.",
