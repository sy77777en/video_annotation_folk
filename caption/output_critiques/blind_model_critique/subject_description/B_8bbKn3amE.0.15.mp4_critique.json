    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic landscape scenery shot, flying low and fast across the surface of a vibrant, turquoise glacial lake. In the background, a massive, rugged mountain rises steeply, its lower slopes a mix of brown and purplish rock, while its peaks are crowned with a thick, white glacier under a clear, deep blue sky. Thin waterfalls of meltwater cascade down the rocky face from the glacier's edge, feeding the lake below. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to immerse the viewer in the vast, pristine, and powerful alpine environment. The focus is on capturing the majestic scale and raw beauty of the natural scene rather than highlighting a specific person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the content as a dynamic landscape shot and describes the primary elements, it could be improved with greater objectivity and more specific visual detail. The description relies on subjective terms such as \"vibrant,\" \"massive,\" \"rugged,\" and \"majestic,\" which should be replaced with more neutral, factual descriptors; for example, instead of \"rugged mountain,\" it could describe a \"mountain with a craggy, uneven rock face.\" The caption also omits several key visual details from the scene. It fails to mention the small, white ice floes that are scattered across the turquoise water's surface, nor does it describe the texture of the water, which is rippled by the fast-moving air from the low-flying perspective. Additionally, the description of the \"thin waterfalls\" is vague; it should specify that they are numerous, forming a delicate, web-like pattern of white streams against the dark rock. Lastly, the final two sentences explaining the lack of a main subject are repetitive and could be consolidated into a single, more concise statement focusing on how the shot's purpose is to convey the scale of the environment.",
