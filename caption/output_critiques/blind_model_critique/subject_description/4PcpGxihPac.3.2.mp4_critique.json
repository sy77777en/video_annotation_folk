    "pre_caption": "In a dark room saturated with red and purple light, a woman with shoulder-length, wavy, light-colored hair stands over several seated people. She wears a light-colored robe with wide, padded sleeves and holds a white document in one hand while gesticulating with the other, raising it in the air. Seated directly in front of her is a man with short, dark hair and a receding hairline, wearing a collared shirt and looking up at her. To his left sits another person with light-colored hair, and to his right, another figure is partially visible, slouched on a couch. The scene is hazy and has a motion-blur effect, obscuring fine details.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully captures the moody atmosphere and the basic composition of the scene, it misses several key visual details that define the subjects' roles and the video's dramatic tone. The central woman's expression is not neutral; she has a look of intense conviction, with her mouth open as if she is in the middle of a powerful oration. Her \"light-colored robe\" is more specifically an ivory-colored, flowing garment with quilted, structured sleeves that have a faint, shimmering pattern visible in the purple light. The \"white document\" she holds is not a modern piece of paper but appears to be a single, large sheet of aged parchment, adding a ritualistic quality to her actions. The primary seated man is not just \"gazing straight ahead\" but is looking up at the woman with a transfixed, almost reverent expression, clarifying their dynamic. Furthermore, the \"hazy\" quality is more akin to a thin, swirling smoke that fills the room, and the \"motion-blur\" is the result of a slow, steady camera zoom-in on the woman, which builds tension and emphasizes her as the focal point of power.",
