    "pre_caption": "The video is a seascape scenery shot. It captures the rhythmic motion of waves gently crashing onto a sandy shore. The focus is on the natural environment, highlighting the contrast between the deep green-blue of the ocean and the dark, wet sand. The white foam of the waves creates a dynamic line that emphasizes the movement and energy of the sea. The absence of a specific subject allows the viewer to appreciate the vastness and tranquility of the coastal scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity and conciseness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is likely accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the scene as a seascape and describes plausible elements like \"deep green-blue\" water, \"dark, wet sand,\" and \"white foam.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is complete in that it covers the main elements of a seascape video. It identifies the type of shot and its primary components.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption violates multiple specific rules from the instructions:\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses words like \"**tranquility**\" and \"**vastness**,\" which are subjective interpretations of the scene's mood and scale. It also uses \"**gently**\" and \"**dynamic**,\" which are borderline subjective.\n    *   **Length for Scenery Shots:** For scenery shots, the instructions specify to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot... using one to three sentences.\" This caption is five sentences long, making it unnecessarily verbose and not concise.\n    *   **Interpretive Language:** The phrase \"allows the viewer to appreciate\" is an interpretation of the video's effect on an audience, rather than a direct description of what is visible. The instructions require describing only what is seen, not the intended emotional impact.\n\nIn summary, while the caption provides a generally accurate picture of the video, it fails as a \"good\" caption under the provided rules because it is too long, uses forbidden subjective and emotional language, and includes interpretation instead of sticking to pure visual description.",
