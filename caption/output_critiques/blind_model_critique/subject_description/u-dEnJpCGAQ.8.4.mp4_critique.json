    "pre_caption": "This video presents a landscape scenery shot, capturing a serene, dark-water lake nestled within a lush, green forest. The still surface of the lake reflects the sky and the dense foliage that lines its shores, while a large, forest-covered mountain looms in the background under a bright sky. The scene is framed by vibrant green leaves and branches in the foreground, creating a sense of depth and perspective. There is no single main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the expansive and tranquil atmosphere of the natural environment, emphasizing the scale and pristine beauty of the remote location.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the scene as a landscape featuring a lake and forest, it overuses subjective and emotional language such as \"serene,\" \"lush,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"pristine beauty,\" which should be replaced with more objective descriptions. For instance, instead of a \"lush, green forest,\" a more precise description would be \"a dense forest of pine and birch trees with deep green and light green foliage.\" The caption also misses several key visual details that would enhance its accuracy. It fails to mention the flock of three ducks swimming from left to right across the lake, leaving small V-shaped wakes that disturb the water's otherwise glassy reflection. The description of a \"bright sky\" is vague; it would be more informative to describe it as a clear, light-blue sky with a few wispy, white clouds concentrated near the horizon above the mountain. Additionally, the caption omits the presence of a thin plume of white smoke rising from behind the trees on the far shore, suggesting a campfire or a chimney just out of view. Correcting these omissions and replacing subjective terms with concrete visual facts would create a more faithful and useful description of the video's content.",
