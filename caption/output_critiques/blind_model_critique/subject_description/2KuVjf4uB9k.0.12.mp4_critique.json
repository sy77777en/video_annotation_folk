    "pre_caption": "The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including \"Royal Purple\" and \"Achilles\" on its body. The car is engaged in a drifting maneuver on a paved track, producing a significant amount of white smoke from its rear tires. The car's sleek design and dynamic motion are highlighted as it navigates a curved section of the track, showcasing its agility and power. The setting appears to be an open, arid landscape, enhancing the focus on the car's performance and the dramatic effect of the drifting action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, most notably the prohibition of subjective language and the rule for describing the background.\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video does show a black sports car with \"Royal Purple\" and \"Achilles\" branding drifting on a track in an arid location, the factual details in the caption are accurate. It correctly identifies the subject (\"sports car\"), its color (\"black\"), specific markings (branding), its action (\"drifting maneuver\"), and the resulting effect (\"white smoke from its rear tires\").\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete. It captures the main subject, its key visual features, its primary action, and the general setting. It provides enough information for a reader to form a mental picture of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails to follow the instructions in several critical areas:\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives\":** The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption is filled with them.\n    *   **\"prominent branding\"**: \"Prominent\" is a subjective judgment of importance.\n    *   **\"significant amount of white smoke\"**: \"Significant\" is a subjective measure. It would be better to simply state that the car produces white smoke.\n    *   **\"sleek design\"**: \"Sleek\" is a subjective aesthetic judgment.\n    *   **\"dynamic motion\"**: \"Dynamic\" is a subjective quality.\n    *   **\"showcasing its agility and power\"**: \"Agility\" and \"power\" are interpretations of the car's performance, not direct visual attributes. This is a major violation.\n    *   **\"dramatic effect\"**: \"Dramatic\" is subjective and emotional.\n\n*   **Violation of Background/Motion Rule:** The instructions state, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects...\" While mentioning the motion (\"drifting\") is necessary as it's the car's primary action, the description of the background is problematic. The caption states the setting \"appears to be an open, arid landscape, **enhancing the focus on the car's performance and the dramatic effect of the drifting action.**\" This bolded part is pure analysis and interpretation, not objective description, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation of Conciseness:** The last two sentences are verbose and filled with the subjective analysis mentioned above. A more compliant caption would be much more direct and concise, focusing only on observable facts.\n\n**In summary, the caption starts with a good, objective description but devolves into subjective, interpretive language, directly violating the core instructions. A good caption would have described the car, its markings, and its action of drifting and producing smoke on a paved track without adding any commentary on its \"power,\" \"agility,\" or the \"dramatic effect\" of the scene.**",
