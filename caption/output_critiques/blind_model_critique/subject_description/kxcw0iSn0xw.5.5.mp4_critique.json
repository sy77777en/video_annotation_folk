    "pre_caption": "The video features a large, red diabolo with a smooth, rounded shape and a central axle, suspended by strings. Initially, the diabolo is clean and prominently displayed. As the video progresses, blue paint is splattered onto its surface, creating a striking contrast with the red. The paint appears thick and glossy, partially covering the diabolo and adding a dynamic visual element. The strings remain taut, indicating the diabolo is in motion or being manipulated. The focus is on the interaction between the paint and the diabolo, highlighting the vivid colors and textures.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the caption based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good, but there are a few minor areas where it deviates from the strictness of the instructions.\n\n#### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"large, red diabolo\" and accurately describes its key features (\"smooth, rounded shape,\" \"central axle,\" \"suspended by strings\"). The description of the central event—blue paint being splattered onto it—is also precise. The details about the paint (\"thick and glossy,\" \"partially covering\") are correct based on the visual evidence.\n\n#### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures the entire narrative of the video by describing the subject's initial state (\"clean and prominently displayed\") and its transformation (\"blue paint is splattered onto its surface\"). It includes all the salient subjects (diabolo, strings, paint) and their most important visual attributes, providing a comprehensive summary of the video's content.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption excels, though with a few minor points for improvement.\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is compact yet provides all the necessary information to understand the video's content.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It masterfully combines details from the beginning to the end of the video into a single, coherent narrative, following the instruction to describe the video as a whole.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses the specific term \"diabolo\" and clearly identifies the \"paint\" and \"strings.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for the diabolo (large, red, smooth, rounded, central axle) and the paint (blue, thick, glossy).\n*   **Describes Change Over Time:** The use of \"Initially...\" and \"As the video progresses...\" is a perfect way to handle the subject's transformation, as instructed.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Areas for Improvement (Minor Deviations from Instructions):**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"striking contrast,\" \"dynamic visual element,\" and \"vivid colors.\" These words are interpretive and describe the *effect* on the viewer rather than the objective visual facts.\n    *   \"Striking contrast\" could be replaced with a more neutral description like \"creating a high contrast between the blue and red.\"\n    *   \"Dynamic visual element\" is an analytical comment, not a description.\n*   **Meta-Commentary:** The final sentence, \"The focus is on the interaction between the paint and the diabolo, highlighting the vivid colors and textures,\" is a form of meta-commentary. It describes the *purpose* or *focus* of the video, which violates the rule to describe only what is visible. A pure description would simply state the facts and let the reader infer the focus.\n*   **Mention of \"Motion\":** The caption states the taut strings are \"indicating the diabolo is in motion or being manipulated.\" While the instruction allows mentioning motion if necessary, a stricter adherence might avoid this inference and simply describe the state of the strings (\"The strings remain taut\"). However, the phrasing \"indicating\" is cautious and justifiable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, this is a **very strong caption** that follows the vast majority of the instructions with a high degree of skill. Its primary strengths are its accurate, complete, and holistic description of the subject and its transformation. The minor weaknesses are its use of a few subjective/analytical terms and a concluding sentence that borders on meta-commentary. By removing these subjective elements, the caption would be a perfect execution of the instructions.",
