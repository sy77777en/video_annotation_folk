    "pre_caption": "The video presents a majestic landscape scenery shot of the Grand Canyon during a dramatic sunset. The sky is a canvas of soft blues and warm, golden light, dominated by a large, dark storm cloud from which visible shafts of rain descend into the canyon below. These rain showers are backlit by the setting sun, creating a striking contrast against the deep shadows that envelop the canyon's vast, layered rock formations. The composition lacks a singular main subject, as the focus is intentionally placed on the immense scale, the atmospheric beauty, and the powerful, transient moment of weather interacting with the iconic landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape scenery shot and explains the absence of a main subject, it relies heavily on subjective and poetic language such as \"majestic,\" \"dramatic,\" and \"canvas of soft blues,\" which the instructions advise against. The description of the storm cloud as simply \"large\" and \"dark\" is too general; in the video, this cloud has a distinct, textured, and billowing underside and appears to drift slowly across the sky, causing the light and shadows on the canyon walls to shift, a key dynamic element that is omitted. Furthermore, the caption mentions \"layered rock formations\" but fails to provide specific visual attributes, such as the distinct horizontal bands of deep red, orange, and brown stone, or how the setting sun illuminates the upper ridges in a bright gold while casting the lower depths into deep purple shadows. The final sentence feels more like an analytical note on compositional intent rather than a fluid part of the description; this point could be conveyed more effectively by describing the vastness and the changing light, which naturally directs focus to the overall environment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a breathtaking view of the Grand Canyon during sunset, highlighting the interplay of light and shadow across the landscape. A textured, billowing storm cloud drifts slowly across the sky, casting dynamic shadows and causing the light to shift on the canyon walls. Shafts of rain descend from the cloud, backlit by the setting sun, creating a striking visual against the deep shadows. The canyon's rock formations display distinct horizontal bands of deep red, orange, and brown, with the upper ridges glowing in bright gold while the lower depths are enveloped in deep purple shadows. The scene captures the vastness and atmospheric beauty of the iconic landscape, emphasizing the powerful interaction between weather and terrain.",
