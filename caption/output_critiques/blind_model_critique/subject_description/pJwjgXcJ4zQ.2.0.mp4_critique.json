    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing the vibrant atmosphere of an urban street. The focus is on the bustling environment, showcasing a lively street with people walking along a tiled sidewalk lined with shops and advertisements. The scene transitions to a busy crosswalk, where pedestrians move purposefully across the street, surrounded by tall buildings and traffic signals. The emphasis is on the dynamic and energetic ambiance of city life, rather than any specific individual or object, highlighting the scale and activity of the urban setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the video as a cityscape scenery shot but relies too heavily on subjective and emotional language such as \"vibrant,\" \"lively,\" and \"energetic,\" which the instructions explicitly forbid. It also lacks the specific, objective visual details required. For instance, instead of just \"people walking,\" you could have mentioned a mix of individuals, such as a man in a dark suit carrying a briefcase and a woman with blonde hair pushing a stroller, to better illustrate the \"bustling\" nature of the scene. The description of \"shops and advertisements\" is too general; you could have specified that the shops have large glass storefronts and that the advertisements are on glowing digital billboards displaying animated logos. Similarly, the \"tall buildings\" could be described as having glass and steel facades that reflect the sky. The caption mentions a transition but fails to specify its type, such as a \"hard cut\" or a \"dissolve,\" as instructed. Finally, the explanation for why it's a scenery shot is repetitive; the first and last sentences convey the same idea, which could be stated more concisely to improve clarity and adhere to the goal of a concise description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a cityscape scene, focusing on an urban street filled with activity. It features a mix of individuals, such as a man in a dark suit carrying a briefcase and a woman with blonde hair pushing a stroller, walking along a tiled sidewalk lined with shops that have large glass storefronts. Digital billboards display animated logos above. The scene transitions with a hard cut to a busy crosswalk, where pedestrians move across the street amidst tall buildings with glass and steel facades reflecting the sky, and traffic signals.
