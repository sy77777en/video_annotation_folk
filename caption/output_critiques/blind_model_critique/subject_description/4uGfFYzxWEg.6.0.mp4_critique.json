    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room, two humanoid figures rendered in a white, low-polygon, geometric style are seated at a long desk. The figure on the left, wearing a matching white hat, sits in a blue office chair, leaning back with its arms crossed. The second figure sits to the right, also in a blue office chair, with its back to the viewer, facing a bank of multiple television screens. Each screen displays a different shot of the same white man with short, light-brown hair and a light-colored collared shirt, who appears as a contestant on a game show, as indicated by the questions and multiple-choice answers also visible on the screens.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two 3D models of humans are sitting in front of a board with multiple screens displaying different men. The 3D models are likely framed as full shots.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It masterfully adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes the scene by identifying the subjects and their specific attributes.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies \"two humanoid figures\" and a \"man\" on the screens. The term \"humanoid figures\" is an excellent choice, acknowledging their human-like shape while accurately capturing their non-realistic, \"low-polygon, geometric style.\"\n*   **Attribute Description:** The details are specific and verifiable: \"white, low-polygon, geometric style,\" \"white hat,\" \"blue office chair,\" \"short, light-brown hair,\" and \"light-colored collared shirt.\"\n*   **Contextual Inference:** The statement that the man is a \"contestant on a game show\" is a well-justified inference, not speculation, because it is immediately supported by the stated visual evidence: \"the questions and multiple-choice answers also visible on the screens.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the essential visual information without being overly long.\n*   **Primary and Secondary Subjects:** It correctly prioritizes the two figures in the room as the primary subjects and then describes the man on the screens as the secondary subject of their attention.\n*   **Pose and Orientation:** It effectively describes the poses of both figures (\"leaning back with its arms crossed,\" \"with its back to the viewer\"), which is crucial for understanding the scene's narrative.\n*   **Object Interaction:** It clearly describes the relationship between the subjects and the key objects they interact with (the desk, chairs, and television screens).\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph that conveys a large amount of information clearly and efficiently.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"picture.\"\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly focuses on the subjects and their immediate surroundings, only mentioning the \"dimly lit room\" to set the scene as instructed.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives, using purely descriptive language (e.g., \"low-polygon\" instead of \"weird\" or \"cool\").\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the two figures using their location (\"on the left,\" \"to the right\").\n*   **Natural English:** The paragraph is well-written, coherent, and uses simple, natural language.\n*   **Formatting:** It is delivered as a single paragraph without any introductory text or markdown, exactly as requested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is of exceptionally high quality. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the instructions by not only following them literally but also by making intelligent choices (like using \"humanoid figures\" and justifying the \"game show\" inference) that result in a description that is both accurate and insightful.",
