    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit room, two humanoid figures rendered in a white, low-polygon, geometric style are seated at a long desk. The figure on the left, wearing a matching white hat, sits in a blue office chair, leaning back with its arms crossed. The second figure sits to the right, also in a blue office chair, with its back to the viewer, facing a bank of multiple television screens. Each screen displays a different shot of the same white man with short, light-brown hair and a light-colored collared shirt, who appears as a contestant on a game show, as indicated by the questions and multiple-choice answers also visible on the screens.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **Two 3D models of humans are sitting in front of a board with multiple screens displaying different men. The 3D models are likely framed as full shots.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two stylized figures and the content on the screens, it misses key dynamic elements and relies on interpretation over observation. The description of the figures as \"low-polygon\" is accurate, but it could be enhanced by noting their material properties, such as if they have a matte or a glossy, reflective finish that catches the light from the screens. The caption describes the content on the screens as static \"images,\" but in the video, the men are likely in motion; the contestant might be seen speaking, looking stressed, or celebrating, while the host could be gesturing towards a game board or reading from a card. Describing this activity would be more accurate for a video. Furthermore, the caption assumes the context of a \"game show,\" which is a subjective inference; it would be more objective to describe the men's actions, such as \"one man speaks animatedly while seated\" and \"the other stands behind a podium.\" The caption also presents the main scene as completely still, but the humanoid figures might exhibit subtle animations, like the figure on the right slightly shifting its posture or the one on the left tapping a geometric finger, indicating they are actively watching. Finally, the \"dimly lit room\" could be detailed further by specifying that the only significant light source is the shifting, blue-toned glow from the monitors, which casts dynamic shadows and highlights across the faceted surfaces of the two observers and their chairs.",
