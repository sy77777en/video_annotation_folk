    "pre_caption": "A man is shown preparing to skydive from an aircraft. He wears a white, black, and red long-sleeved jumpsuit with Red Bull branding on the chest and sleeves, over which he has a black parachute harness. On his head, he wears a yellow helmet with red and blue Red Bull logos and a small camera mounted on top. He also wears white-framed sunglasses under a clear visor. Initially, he is inside the aircraft, holding onto the door frame and looking at the camera. He then jumps out, extending his arms to his sides in a stable freefall position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. It is accurate, mostly complete, and follows the specific formatting and content rules almost perfectly.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"man\" and his activity as preparing to \"skydive.\" The descriptions of his gear are precise and correct:\n*   **Jumpsuit:** \"white, black, and red long-sleeved jumpsuit with Red Bull branding.\"\n*   **Harness:** \"black parachute harness.\"\n*   **Helmet:** \"yellow helmet with red and blue Red Bull logos and a small camera mounted on top.\"\n*   **Eyewear:** \"white-framed sunglasses under a clear visor.\"\n*   **Actions:** The sequence of him being inside the aircraft, holding the door, jumping, and assuming a freefall position is described exactly as it happens.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete in describing the most salient aspects of the video. It focuses entirely on the main subject and his actions, which is the correct approach. It successfully captures the entire narrative arc of the short video—the preparation, the jump, and the immediate aftermath.\n\nThe only minor area for potential improvement would be the inclusion of the man's personal features (e.g., skin tone, approximate age), but only if these are clearly discernible. As per the instructions to \"avoid describing what you are unsure about,\" omitting these details is the correct choice if they are not perfectly clear. The description of the gear and action is more than sufficient to create a clear mental image.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption demonstrates an outstanding adherence to the detailed instructions:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a compact, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Single Paragraph, No Markdown/Intro:** It is correctly formatted as a single block of text without any introductory phrases.\n*   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** The description is entirely focused on the man and his visual attributes, as instructed.\n*   **Avoids \"Frame\" or \"Image\":** These terms are not used.\n*   **Avoids Unnecessary Background/Motion:** It mentions the \"aircraft\" and the action of \"jumps out,\" which is essential for describing the subject's location and action, thus following the exception rule correctly.\n*   **Avoids Subjective Adjectives:** The language is objective and descriptive (e.g., \"stable freefall position\" instead of \"brave jump\").\n*   **Precise Subject Type:** It uses the precise term \"man.\"\n*   **Describes Transitions/Sequence:** It masterfully handles the temporal aspect of the video by using \"Initially...\" and \"He then jumps out...\" to describe the change in the subject's state and location without breaking the flow of the paragraph. This is a perfect execution of the instruction to describe how subjects change or transition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, detailed, objective, and structured perfectly. It successfully translates the key visual information of the video into a concise and accurate text description.",
