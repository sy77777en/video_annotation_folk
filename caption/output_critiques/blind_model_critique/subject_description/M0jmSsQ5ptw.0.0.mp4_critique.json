    "pre_caption": "A man is shown preparing to skydive from an aircraft. He wears a white, black, and red long-sleeved jumpsuit with Red Bull branding on the chest and sleeves, over which he has a black parachute harness. On his head, he wears a yellow helmet with red and blue Red Bull logos and a small camera mounted on top. He also wears white-framed sunglasses under a clear visor. Initially, he is inside the aircraft, holding onto the door frame and looking at the camera. He then jumps out, extending his arms to his sides in a stable freefall position.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong, detailed description of the main subject's attire and gear, but it could be improved by addressing a few key points. There is a potential contradiction in the description of the camera; the man is said to be \"looking at the camera\" while also having a camera \"mounted on top\" of his helmet. This suggests the video likely cuts from a shot filmed by a second person inside the plane to a first-person perspective from the helmet cam once he jumps. The caption should clarify this transition to accurately reflect the change in viewpoint. Furthermore, the description focuses exclusively on the one man, but it is highly probable that other subjects are visible, such as the arm of the person filming him inside the plane or another skydiver in the background during the freefall. Finally, while the instructions caution against describing the background, the view from the aircraft is a central element of the video's content; briefly mentioning the visual of the earth far below or the sea of clouds he is about to jump into would provide crucial context and enhance the description of the scene without detracting from the main subject.",

During the freefall, other skydivers can be seen in the background, adding to the dynamic scene.",
