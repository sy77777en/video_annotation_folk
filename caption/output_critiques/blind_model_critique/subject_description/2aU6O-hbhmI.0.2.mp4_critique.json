Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent and detailed feedback. Here is a breakdown of the caption's performance based on the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but has a few significant issues that prevent it from perfectly adhering to the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the content as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" at sunset, featuring \"cranes\" and \"glass buildings.\" It accurately assesses that the focus is on the overall environment rather than a specific, salient subject.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is reasonably complete for a scenery shot. It captures the essential elements (urban structures, time of day, colorful sky) and provides a good sense of the video's content and composition.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nHere is a point-by-point analysis of how the caption follows or violates the provided rules:\n\n*   **Strengths (Rules Followed):**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and explains *why* there is no main subject, focusing on the \"expansive view,\" \"scale,\" and \"interplay between the constructed environment and the natural beauty of the sunset.\"\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The description is a clear, single paragraph that is easy to understand.\n    *   **Forbidden Words:** It successfully avoids forbidden terms like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"video\" (except in the opening meta-statement).\n    *   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses specific terms like \"cranes\" and \"glass buildings.\"\n    *   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole, not as a sequence of frames.\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Rules Violated):**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives (Major Violation):** The most significant issue is the violation of the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses several subjective and interpretive words:\n        *   \"**vibrant** urban environment\"\n        *   \"**towering** cranes\" (This can be borderline, but \"tall\" is more objective.)\n        *   \"**modern** glass buildings\"\n        *   \"**dramatic** atmosphere\"\n        *   \"natural **beauty**\"\n        These words describe feelings or judgments about the scene rather than just its visual attributes.\n    *   **Meta-Description (Minor Violation):** The caption begins with \"The video is a cityscape scenery shot.\" The instructions ask for a description of the video's content, not a description *of* the video itself. A more integrated approach would be to start describing the scene directly (e.g., \"A cityscape at sunset features...\").\n    *   **Repetitiveness in Scenery Explanation (Minor Violation):** The instruction for scenery shots asks for a brief explanation (one to three sentences) for the lack of a main subject. The caption explains this point three separate times: \"...with the focus on the expansive view rather than a specific object,\" \"...emphasizing the scale and development of the city,\" and \"...rather than centering on a single subject.\" This is slightly redundant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies the video type and its key elements. However, its frequent use of subjective adjectives is a direct and major violation of the instructions. The minor issues of the meta-opening and repetitive explanation also detract from its quality. To be considered \"good\" according to the rules, it would need to be rewritten to be purely objective and descriptive.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A cityscape at sunset features an expansive urban environment with tall cranes and glass buildings, highlighting the city's scale and development. The sky displays a gradient of warm oranges and cool blues, showcasing the interaction between the constructed environment and the sunset.",
