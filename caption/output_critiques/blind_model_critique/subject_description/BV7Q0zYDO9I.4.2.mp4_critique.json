    "pre_caption": "An aerial view shows a convoy of identical white trucks with black roofs emerging from a large, arched-roof hangar. The trucks proceed in a single file line along a two-lane road toward a four-way intersection marked with white crosswalks. The scene is set in an industrial area with several grey, utilitarian buildings, including a rectangular structure with a weathered, flat roof and vents. A small, fortified guard tower stands near one corner of the intersection. The asphalt roads are lined with yellow and white markings and flanked by sidewalks with streetlights.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It effectively follows all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subjects as a \"convoy of identical white trucks with black roofs\" and their primary action of \"emerging from a large, arched-roof hangar\" and proceeding along a road. The description of the environment, including the \"industrial area,\" \"grey, utilitarian buildings,\" \"four-way intersection,\" and \"guard tower,\" is precise and paints a clear picture of the scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive without being overly long. It captures the most salient moving and static elements. It starts with the primary subjects (the trucks) and their action, then broadens to include the key features of the surrounding environment, providing essential context. Details like the \"arched-roof hangar,\" \"weathered, flat roof and vents\" on another building, and \"yellow and white markings\" on the road add significant value and help the reader visualize the scene in detail.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres strictly to the guidelines:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of information in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly prioritizes the trucks as the main subjects and describes their attributes and actions before moving to the secondary, static subjects of the environment.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the video as a continuous event (\"emerging,\" \"proceed\") rather than a series of static frames.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types like \"trucks,\" \"hangar,\" and \"guard tower.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"white,\" \"black,\" \"arched-roof,\" \"grey,\" \"rectangular\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for each subject mentioned (e.g., \"white trucks with black roofs,\" \"large, arched-roof hangar\").\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description follows a logical flow, starting with the most dynamic element (the convoy) and then describing the static context, which is an effective way to structure the information.\n*   **Describes \"Revealing\" Action:** It perfectly captures the action of the trucks \"emerging from\" the hangar, as instructed for subjects that are revealed over time.",
