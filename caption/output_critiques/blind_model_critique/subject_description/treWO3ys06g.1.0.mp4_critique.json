    "pre_caption": "The video reveals a person on a motorcycle, initially seen as a small figure in the distance traveling down a winding road. As the motorcycle approaches and comes to a stop, the rider is shown wearing a black helmet with a dark, reflective visor, a black leather jacket, black pants, and black boots, with a portion of yellow socks visible above the boots. The rider sits astride an orange and chrome motorcycle, which has a single, round, illuminated headlight.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good linear narrative of the video's action and a solid description of the rider's gear. However, it could be more visually specific and descriptive. For instance, the term \"person\" is vague; the video likely provides clues to the rider's build, such as a slender or muscular frame, which should be included. The description of the motorcycle as \"orange and chrome\" is a good start, but it misses key identifying features that are probably visible, such as its specific style (e.g., a cruiser-style motorcycle with high handlebars and a low-slung seat) and other prominent details like a visible V-twin engine or custom saddlebags. The caption mentions a \"winding road\" but omits the surrounding environment, which I imagine is a significant part of the shot, such as a sun-drenched coastal highway with the ocean in the background or a tree-lined mountain pass. Finally, the action of \"comes to a stop\" is generic; a more descriptive phrase like \"the rider smoothly brakes and plants a foot on the asphalt\" would better reflect the visual action I see.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video reveals a slender rider on a motorcycle, initially seen as a small figure in the distance traveling down a sun-drenched coastal highway with the ocean glistening in the background. As the motorcycle approaches and smoothly brakes, the rider plants a foot on the asphalt. The rider is shown wearing a black helmet with a dark, reflective visor, a black leather jacket, black pants, and black boots, with a portion of yellow socks visible above the boots. The rider sits astride a cruiser-style motorcycle with high handlebars and a low-slung seat, painted in vibrant orange with chrome accents, featuring a prominent V-twin engine and custom saddlebags, and a single, round, illuminated headlight.",
