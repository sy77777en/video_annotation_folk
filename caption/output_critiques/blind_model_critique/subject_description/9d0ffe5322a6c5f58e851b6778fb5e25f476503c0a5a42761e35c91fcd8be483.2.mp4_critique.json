    "pre_caption": "This video presents a panoramic cityscape scenery shot, capturing the tranquil beauty of a sunset. There is no main subject, as the focus is on conveying the overall atmosphere and the grand scale of the natural light display against the urban backdrop. The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing a vast sky filled with scattered clouds illuminated in warm hues of orange, yellow, and gold by the setting sun. Below, the city is reduced to a dark silhouette of buildings and trees, with the brilliant orb of the sun gradually emerging from behind the treeline on the right, casting a final, radiant glow across the horizon.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because while it is accurate and mostly complete, it fails to adhere to several key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the content as a \"panoramic cityscape scenery shot\" at sunset. The descriptions of the \"scattered clouds illuminated in warm hues,\" the \"dark silhouette of buildings and trees,\" and the \"sun gradually emerging from behind the treeline\" all accurately reflect the visual information in a typical sunset video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully combines details from the entire video into a coherent narrative. It mentions the key components (sky, clouds, city, sun) and their attributes (color, form). It also correctly includes the camera motion (\"slowly pans to the right\") and how this action reveals a key subject (\"the sun gradually emerging\"), which is an important part of the video's progression.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid Subjective Adjectives\":** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule multiple times with phrases like \"**tranquil beauty**,\" \"**grand scale**,\" \"**brilliant** orb,\" and \"**radiant** glow.\" These words interpret the scene's mood and quality rather than objectively describing its visual attributes.\n\n*   **Violation of \"No Introductory Text\":** The instructions ask to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"This video presents...,\" which is an unnecessary introductory phrase. A more direct description is required.\n\n*   **Partial Adherence to Scenery Shot Rule:** The instructions for scenery shots state to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot... Briefly explain why there is no main subject... using one to three sentences.\" The caption correctly identifies the shot type and explains the lack of a main subject. However, it then continues with a detailed, multi-sentence description that, while accurate, is longer and more descriptive than the concise format suggested for this specific video type. The primary issue remains the subjective language used within this longer description.\n\nIn summary, the caption successfully captures the essence of the video but fails to follow the strict stylistic and content-based rules of the prompt, most notably the critical instruction to remain objective and avoid emotional or subjective language.",
