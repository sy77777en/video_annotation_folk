    "pre_caption": "The video features two license plates partially embedded in a pebbly beach. The plate on the left is white with a blue border and displays the word \"Jazz\" in bold black letters, accompanied by a musical note symbol. The plate on the right is black with white lettering, displaying the word \"COFFEE.\" Both plates are positioned at an angle, leaning against the pebbles, with the ocean visible in the background. The scene suggests a playful juxtaposition of themes, combining music and coffee in a coastal setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the two license plates and their text, but it misses several key visual details present in the video. For instance, it fails to mention the condition of the plates; the video shows they are weathered, with rust creeping in from the edges and the paint slightly faded, suggesting they have been on the beach for some time. The description of the symbols is also too general; the \"musical note symbol\" on the white \"Jazz\" plate is specifically a black eighth note, and the black \"COFFEE\" plate has a small, white, stylized steaming cup icon to the left of the word. Most importantly, the final sentence offers a subjective interpretation (\"playful juxtaposition\"), which violates the instruction to avoid subjective language. The caption also treats the scene as static, whereas the video includes the gentle, rhythmic motion of foamy waves washing up to the edge of the pebbles just below the plates, causing the light to shimmer on the wet stones. A more complete description would incorporate the weathered state of the plates and the specific symbols while omitting the interpretive final sentence and briefly noting the interaction with the water to better reflect the video's content.",
