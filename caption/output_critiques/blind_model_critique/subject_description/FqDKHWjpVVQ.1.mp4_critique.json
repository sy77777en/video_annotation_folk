    "pre_caption": "This video presents a first-person perspective from a video game, looking out over a dusty, arid landscape. In the foreground, a black assault rifle with a scope is held, pointing towards the center of the scene. The environment contains several green, leafy trees and bushes scattered across the brown, uneven terrain. In the midground, a white sedan and a dark, military-style truck are parked near some simple, blocky structures. A digital heads-up display is overlaid on the view, featuring a blue minimap in the lower-left corner, a blue ammunition counter in the lower-right, and orange, diamond-shaped objective markers in the center.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the weapon, and the presence of a heads-up display, it lacks the specific detail needed to fully capture the imagined scene. The description of \"another white car\" is vague; it could be more precise by identifying it as a white pickup truck with a dented tailgate, distinguishing it from the sedan. The \"simple, blocky structures\" could be described with more clarity, for instance, as two single-story, flat-roofed concrete buildings in a light tan color, one of which has a visible, dark, open doorway. The description of the assault rifle is missing the player's hands, which would be visible gripping the weapon; for example, it could mention a pair of black, fingerless tactical gloves holding the rifle. Furthermore, the heads-up display description is incomplete, as it omits a compass bar at the top of the screen and the distance in meters displayed just below each orange objective marker. Finally, the caption treats the scene as static, failing to mention subtle dynamic elements like the gentle swaying of the tree leaves in the wind or the slow drift of the clouds across the sky, which are key to conveying that this is a video and not a still image.",
