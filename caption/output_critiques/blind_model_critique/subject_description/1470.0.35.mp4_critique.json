    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with short blonde hair wearing a blue and white checkered dress, positioned near a refrigerator. She appears to be interacting with a group of people. A man in a mustard yellow sweater and dark pants is seen reaching towards a child. The child, wearing a colorful patterned outfit and a red hat, is facing the man. A woman with a pink headscarf and a light-colored dress stands nearby, partially turned away. In the background, another person with short dark hair, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, is visible near a yellow door. The scene suggests a lively interaction among the group in a domestic setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**. While it successfully captures some visual details, it violates several key rules of the instruction set.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses:\n\n### Why the Caption Fails (Adherence to Instructions)\n\n1.  **Use of Interpretive and Uncertain Language:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption violates this rule with phrases like:\n    *   \"**She appears to be** interacting...\" - This is an interpretation of her actions, not a direct description of them.\n    *   \"**The scene suggests** a lively interaction...\" - This is a major violation, as it offers a high-level summary and interpretation of the scene's mood and context rather than describing visible facts.\n\n2.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n    *   The word \"**lively**\" is a subjective adjective that describes the mood of the interaction, which is an interpretation and not a visual fact.\n\n3.  **Summarizing the Setting:** The final sentence concludes with \"...in a **domestic setting**.\" While the presence of a refrigerator might imply this, the instruction is to describe the subjects and their attributes, not to label the overall environment. It's better to state the visible objects (like the refrigerator) and let the reader infer the setting.\n\n4.  **Weak Phrasing:** The instructions call for \"simple, natural English\" and a \"clear, concise\" paragraph. The caption uses passive and slightly wordy constructions.\n    *   \"...**is seen** reaching towards a child.\"\n    *   \"...**is visible** near a yellow door.\"\n    *   A more direct and concise style would be: \"A man... reaches towards a child,\" and \"a person... is near a yellow door.\"\n\n### What the Caption Does Well (Positive Aspects)\n\n1.  **Subject Identification and Detail:** The caption correctly identifies subjects as \"woman,\" \"man,\" and \"child\" and provides good, specific visual attributes for each (e.g., \"short blonde hair,\" \"blue and white checkered dress,\" \"mustard yellow sweater,\" \"pink headscarf\").\n\n2.  **Distinguishing Multiple Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the multiple people by describing their unique clothing, hair, and actions, which aligns with the instructions.\n\n3.  **Structure and Format:** It is presented as a single, coherent paragraph without using forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n4.  **Focus on Subjects:** The description correctly focuses on the people in the scene as the salient subjects.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because its violations of core negative constraints—avoiding interpretation, uncertainty, and subjective language—outweigh its successes in descriptive detail. The final sentence, in particular, fundamentally misunderstands the task by providing a subjective summary instead of an objective description. A good caption would present only the observable facts (who is there, what they look like, what they are doing) without drawing any conclusions about their interactions or the nature of the scene.",
