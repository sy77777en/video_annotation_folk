The shots highlight the scale and spatial arrangement, creating a sense of place. This type of shot could serve as an establishing shot, setting the scene and providing context for the viewer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is too abstract and analytical, failing to ground the description in specific visual details from the imagined video. While it correctly identifies the content as an interior scenery shot, it relies on generic terms like \"architectural design,\" \"atmosphere,\" and \"scale\" without describing the actual elements that create these impressions. For instance, if the video showed a modern museum lobby, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the polished concrete floors, the cavernous space with its high ceilings, or the massive, curving white wall that dominates the interior. It also neglects to mention the specific quality of the lighting, such as sunlight streaming through large, geometric windows to create stark shadows on the floor. The final sentence, which explains the shot's potential cinematic function as an \"establishing shot,\" is an interpretation rather than a description and violates the instruction to describe only what is visible. Furthermore, if there were a few small, distant figures of people walking through the space, their inclusion would be crucial for conveying the vastness of the environment, yet the caption omits any mention of subjects, even minor ones. An improved caption would replace abstract analysis with concrete descriptions of the space's materials, shapes, and lighting to effectively communicate the scene's visual character.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a modern museum lobby, featuring polished concrete floors and a cavernous space with high ceilings. A massive, curving white wall dominates the interior, while sunlight streams through large, geometric windows, casting stark shadows on the floor. A few small, distant figures walk through the space, emphasizing the vastness of the environment. The scene captures the sleek, minimalist design and the interplay of light and shadow, creating a striking visual impression.",
