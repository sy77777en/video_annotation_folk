    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned, middle-aged man with a dark beard and mustache is shown driving a car at night. He wears a dark beanie and a dark jacket. Initially seen in profile from the passenger's side, he looks forward while gripping the steering wheel. A black assault rifle is propped up in the car next to him. The perspective then shifts to a view from inside the vehicle, looking out the front windshield. The man's hands are visible on the steering wheel as he drives along a wet, two-lane road toward a vehicle in the distance with bright headlights and flashing red and blue lights. The man remains in the driver's seat as the camera's focus moves away from him to the view ahead.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but could be enhanced with more specific visual details and more precise language to better reflect the scene's tension. While the description of the man is clear, the placement of the \"black assault rifle\" is vague; specifying if it's on the passenger seat or leaning against the center console would improve clarity. The phrase \"the perspective then shifts\" is ambiguous; stating it's a \"hard cut\" would be more descriptive and align with the likely jarring nature of such a scene change. In the second shot, mentioning the action of the windshield wipers would actively reinforce the description of the \"wet\" road. The description of the distant vehicle with \"flashing red and blue lights\" strongly implies law enforcement; it would be more direct and informative to identify it as a \"police vehicle\" or \"emergency vehicle.\" Finally, the last sentence is slightly redundant; the information that the man remains in his seat while the focus shifts could be integrated more concisely into the description of the second shot, for instance, by describing the view from his perspective looking out the windshield toward the approaching police car.",
