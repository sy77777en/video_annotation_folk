    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

It perfectly aligns with the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It precisely describes the subject (\"a man\"), his key visual attributes (\"short, dark, wavy hair,\" \"dark, structured jacket\"), and a unique detail (\"light-colored dust or powder... across his shoulders\"). The description of the action (\"walks away\") and the resulting visual effect (\"becoming a silhouette\") is also a correct and logical interpretation of the described scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, capturing all the essential elements of the video in a condensed format. It describes the subject's initial appearance, the action he performs, the environment relevant to that action, and the visual transformation that occurs over the course of the video. No critical visual information appears to be missing.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in just a few sentences.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The focus is entirely on the man, his appearance, and his action.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Necessary Context:** It correctly includes the motion (\"walks away\") and background (\"dimly lit, green-hued corridor\") because they are essential to explain why the subject becomes a silhouette.\n*   **Objective Language:** The description is factual and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details about the man's hair and clothing as instructed.\n*   **Describes Transition:** It perfectly executes the instruction to describe a subject's transition by explaining how \"his figure becoming a silhouette against the light at the far end.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is clear, detailed, and effectively communicates the visual content of the video.",
