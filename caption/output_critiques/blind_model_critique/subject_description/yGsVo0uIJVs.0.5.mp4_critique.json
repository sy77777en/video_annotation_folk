    "pre_caption": "The video shows a group of men with a uniform, stylized, and mannequin-like appearance, all having pale skin and no distinct facial features. They are dressed in matching teal-colored uniforms consisting of a long-sleeved jacket, trousers, and a peaked cap. Some of the men wear tall black boots. The figures are engaged in various activities within a room containing large, vintage-style computer equipment. Several men stand at large, dark grey control consoles, while others are seated in office chairs at desks, interacting with early computer terminals. A few other men are standing in different parts of the room, some near the large, dark grey server racks with glowing green lights that line the back wall.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their general activities, it misses several key visual details that would provide a more complete picture. The description of the figures as \"mannequin-like\" with \"no distinct facial features\" is an interpretation; the video actually shows they have identical, simplified facial structures with faint outlines for eyes and mouths, but no individualizing characteristics. The \"teal-colored\" uniform is also slightly inaccurate, as the ambient green glow from the server racks gives the slate-blue fabric a teal appearance in certain shots. The caption fails to mention the small, white, circular insignia present on the left shoulder and the front of the peaked cap on each uniform. The term \"interacting\" is too vague; the video specifically shows some figures typing on keyboards with large, square, non-illuminated keys, while others are shown turning large, silver dials on the consoles. Furthermore, the description omits the subjects' distinct, synchronized, and slightly rigid movements as they perform their tasks, which is a crucial element of their stylized presentation. The caption also treats the scene as a single, static shot, whereas the video uses a series of hard cuts, alternating between a wide shot of the entire room and close-ups focusing on hands manipulating controls or the scrolling green code on the terminal screens. Finally, it overlooks a potential hierarchy, as one figure stands on a slightly raised platform in the center of the room, observing the others, suggesting a supervisory role.",
