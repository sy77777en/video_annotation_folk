    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of tall, dry grass, revealing a person walking through a shallow body of water. The person is wearing dark, knee-high rubber boots and light-colored pants. The boots create ripples in the water as they move, indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace. The grass initially obscures the view, but as the scene progresses, the focus shifts to the boots and the water, highlighting the interaction between the person and the natural environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it is accurate in its description of the visual content, its structure and language violate the rules provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its flaws:\n\n**1. Thematic Interpretation and Subjectivity:**\n*   The caption concludes with, \"...highlighting the interaction between the person and the natural environment.\" This is a thematic analysis of the video's meaning, not a visual description of its subjects. The instructions explicitly state to focus on subject types and visual attributes and to avoid subjective interpretations.\n*   The phrase \"...indicating the person's slow, deliberate pace\" is an inference about the person's intent (\"deliberate\") rather than a direct observation. A more compliant description would state the observable fact, such as \"The person walks slowly, creating ripples in the water.\"\n\n**2. Narrative and Temporal Language:**\n*   The caption uses a play-by-play narrative style with phrases like \"The video begins with...\" and \"as the scene progresses...\". The instructions require combining details from the entire video into a single, coherent paragraph that avoids referring to the temporal sequence of viewing. Instead of describing the viewing experience, it should describe the scene's content holistically.\n\n**3. Incomplete Subject Description:**\n*   While it correctly identifies a \"person,\" it misses an opportunity to be more specific. The instructions ask to describe subjects by combining details from all frames. The caption describes the subject being \"revealed\" but treats the grass and the person as separate narrative beats. A better approach would be to describe the scene as a whole: \"A person, partially obscured by tall, dry grass, walks through a shallow body of water.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is poor because it offers thematic interpretation, makes inferential claims, and uses a narrative style forbidden by the instructions. A good caption would have been a single, objective paragraph describing the person, their visible clothing (dark rubber boots, light-colored pants), and their action (walking through water) without analyzing the video's pace, theme, or temporal progression.",
