    "pre_caption": "This video is an aerial landscape scenery shot that glides alongside a majestic, conical mountain peak covered in a dense, lush green forest. Thick, white clouds and fog swirl around the mountain's base and sides, creating a serene and ethereal \"sea of clouds\" effect, with the tips of other distant peaks visible in the background under a bright, overcast sky. There is no main subject because the focus is on capturing the grand scale and atmospheric mood of the environment, emphasizing the vastness of nature rather than a specific object or entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the content as an aerial landscape shot and accurately describes the key elements, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The description uses subjective and emotional adjectives like \"majestic,\" \"lush,\" \"serene,\" and \"ethereal,\" which should be replaced with more objective, factual descriptors. For instance, instead of a \"majestic, conical mountain,\" you could describe \"a large, steeply sloped mountain with a pointed peak.\" The final sentence explaining the lack of a main subject is overly long and analytical; this concept should be conveyed more subtly within the description of the scene's scale. The caption also misses some potential visual details that would enhance clarity, such as the texture of the forest (e.g., \"covered in dark green coniferous trees\"), the specific appearance of the peak (e.g., \"a rocky, pointed summit\"), or the texture of the clouds (e.g., \"a solid, flat blanket of clouds\"). Finally, the phrase \"'sea of clouds' effect\" is a bit colloquial; a more direct description like \"a vast, unbroken layer of white clouds filling the valleys\" would be more effective and descriptive.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features an aerial landscape shot of a large, steeply sloped mountain with a pointed, rocky summit, covered in dark green coniferous trees. Thick, white clouds and fog envelop the mountain's base and sides, forming a vast, unbroken layer of white clouds filling the valleys. The tips of other distant peaks are visible in the background under a bright, overcast sky, highlighting the expansive scale and atmospheric mood of the natural environment.",
