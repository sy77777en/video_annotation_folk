    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\n**Caption:** A man is seen from behind, walking away from the camera on a wet, sandy beach. He is wearing blue jeans, a dark long-sleeved shirt, and a dark blue puffy vest. In his right hand, he carries a camera mounted on a tripod. He has short, dark hair and appears to be of average build.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation**\n\nOverall, the caption is **very good** and adheres to the vast majority of the instructions. It is clear, descriptive, and well-structured. However, there is one minor deviation from the rules.\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes a single subject (\"man\") and provides specific, verifiable details about his appearance, the object he is carrying, and his action. The use of \"appears to be of average build\" is excellent, as it conveys an observation without stating it as an absolute fact, adhering to the rule of not describing what you are unsure about.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\nThe caption is commendably complete regarding the visible subject. It successfully describes:\n*   **Clothing:** \"blue jeans, a dark long-sleeved shirt, and a dark blue puffy vest.\"\n*   **Hairstyle:** \"short, dark hair.\"\n*   **Object:** \"a camera mounted on a tripod.\"\n*   **Pose and Action:** \"seen from behind, walking away from the camera.\"\n\nCrucially, it correctly omits details that would not be visible from behind (e.g., facial expression, facial hair, ethnicity), which demonstrates a strong understanding of the instruction to \"avoid describing what is not visible.\"\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions**\n\nThe caption follows most of the instructions perfectly.\n\n**Strengths (Rules Followed):**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear mental picture without unnecessary words.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is entirely centered on the man and his attributes.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses \"man,\" \"camera,\" and \"tripod\" instead of vague terms.\n*   **No Forbidden Words:** It avoids \"image\" and \"frame.\"\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear and easy to understand.\n*   **Single Paragraph Format:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **No Subjective Adjectives:** It avoids emotional or opinion-based language.\n*   **Describes Key Attributes:** It details clothing, hair, and the object being carried.\n\n**Area for Improvement (Minor Deviation):**\n*   **Mention of Background:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships.\" The caption includes the phrase \"on a wet, sandy beach,\" which describes the background. Since there is only one subject, this detail is not *necessary* to distinguish him from other subjects. While it adds useful context, it technically violates this specific rule. A stricter adherence would have omitted the location to focus exclusively on the subject.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is excellent and almost perfectly aligned with the instructions. Its only flaw is the inclusion of background details that, while helpful for context, are not strictly necessary according to the provided rules. To be 100% compliant, the phrase \"on a wet, sandy beach\" would be removed.",
