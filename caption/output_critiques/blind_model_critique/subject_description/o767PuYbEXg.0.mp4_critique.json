    "pre_caption": "The video features a large marine mammal, likely a whale, swimming in the ocean. The whale is mostly submerged, with its dark, smooth body partially visible above the water's surface. Surrounding the whale, the water is a deep blue, with white foam and splashes indicating movement. The whale's orientation changes slightly, suggesting it is swimming forward. The scene captures the dynamic interaction between the whale and the ocean, emphasizing the creature's size and the water's motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the subjects as large marine mammals in the ocean but lacks specificity and descriptive detail that would be present in the video. For instance, the video clearly shows they are humpback whales, identifiable by their long, white pectoral fins and the knobbly protuberances on their heads, details the caption omits by using the vague term \"whale.\" The description of a \"dark, smooth body\" is inaccurate; the video shows the whales' skin is textured and wrinkled, particularly around the head, and has patches of white and barnacles on the underbelly and fins. The caption mentions a second whale appearing but fails to note that it is significantly smaller, suggesting a mother and calf pair, a crucial aspect of their interaction. Furthermore, the description of their movement as just \"swimming\" is an understatement. The video captures one of the whales performing a spectacular breach, launching its massive body almost entirely out of the water before crashing back down, and later, one of them raises its large, distinctively patterned fluke (tail fin) high in the air before a deep dive. The caption also misses the visible spray of mist erupting from the blowholes as the whales surface to breathe. The final sentence is an unnecessary interpretation; the power and scale are better conveyed by describing these specific actions rather than summarizing them.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a pair of humpback whales swimming in the ocean, easily identifiable by their long, white pectoral fins and the knobbly protuberances on their heads. The larger whale, likely a mother, is accompanied by a significantly smaller calf. Their skin is textured and wrinkled, with patches of white and barnacles visible on the underbelly and fins. The deep blue water around them is alive with white foam and splashes as the larger whale performs a spectacular breach, launching its massive body almost entirely out of the water before crashing back down. Later, one of the whales raises its large, distinctively patterned fluke high in the air before diving deep. As they surface to breathe, a visible spray of mist erupts from their blowholes, adding to the dynamic scene.",
