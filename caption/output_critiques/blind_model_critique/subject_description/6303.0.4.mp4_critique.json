The person is wearing a light green sleeve. The smartphone screen initially displays an image of a man with a beard and mustache, wearing a hood, with the text \"KODAK ONHA\" and music player controls visible. Later, the screen shows a colorful graphic with the text \"SUMMER HITS,\" featuring flowers and a cactus, along with an \"Add to Playlist\" button.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good and highly effective. It is accurate, detailed, and follows the vast majority of the complex instructions. However, it has one minor but clear violation of a specific negative constraint.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key subjects and their attributes:\n*   The hand's skin tone and long, pink-painted nails.\n*   The light green sleeve.\n*   The smartphone as the object being held.\n*   The initial screen content, including the man with a beard and hood, the text \"KODAK ONHA,\" and music player controls.\n*   The subsequent screen content, including the \"SUMMER HITS\" graphic, flowers, a cactus, and the \"Add to Playlist\" button.\n*   The action of the hand interacting with the screen.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It captures the most salient visual information from the entire video, describing both the static elements (the hand, the phone) and the dynamic ones (the change in screen content). It successfully combines details from the beginning and end of the video into a coherent narrative.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of information in a single, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly focuses on the primary subjects (hand, smartphone) and their visual attributes.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the video's progression (\"initially... Later...\") without using forbidden terms like \"first frame\" or \"last frame.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective adjectives, using descriptive words like \"colorful\" appropriately to describe a visual quality rather than an opinion.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses clear and precise terms like \"hand,\" \"smartphone,\" and \"man.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for the hand (skin tone, nails), clothing (sleeve color), and screen content (text, graphics, UI elements).\n*   **Handling Transitions:** It perfectly describes the change in the smartphone's display and correctly attributes it to the hand's interaction, fulfilling the instruction to describe how subjects switch or change.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, unformatted paragraph as requested.\n\n**Weakness (Where the caption fails to adhere):**\n*   **Use of a Forbidden Word:** The caption violates the instruction: \"**avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.**\" It uses the word \"image\" in the sentence: \"The smartphone screen initially displays an **image** of a man...\"\n\n**How to Fix It:**\nThis is a minor error that could be easily corrected by rephrasing the sentence. For example:\n*   \"The smartphone screen initially displays a man with a beard and mustache...\"\n\nBy removing the word \"image,\" the caption would be in full compliance with all instructions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe caption is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of почти all the instructions. Its accuracy, detail, and structure are commendable. The only flaw is the use of the forbidden word \"image,\" which prevents it from being a perfect execution of the prompt.",
