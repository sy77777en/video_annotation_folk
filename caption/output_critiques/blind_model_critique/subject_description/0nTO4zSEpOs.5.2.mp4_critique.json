    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a brightly lit menu board displaying various skewered food items, including vegetables and meats, arranged neatly on a tray. The board features text in Japanese, with a decorative design that includes images of the food. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to a modern indoor walkway with a sleek, minimalist design. The walkway is lined with metal railings and illuminated by soft lighting. A man, dressed in dark clothing, is seen walking away from the camera towards a distant area with visible signage and storefronts. The man gradually disappears from the frame as he continues down the corridor, emphasizing the spacious and contemporary setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is very good but has a few minor flaws that prevent it from perfectly adhering to all instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two distinct scenes in the video: a close-up of a food menu and a man walking down a modern corridor. The descriptions of the subjects—skewered food on a menu with Japanese text, and a man in dark clothing walking away from the camera—are factually correct based on the visual information.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive and well-balanced. It successfully captures the most salient subjects and actions from both parts of the video without getting bogged down in excessive detail. It correctly prioritizes the subjects in the order they appear, starting with the menu and then transitioning to the man in the walkway, which follows the video's narrative flow.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption is strong, but not perfect.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear, one-paragraph summary that is easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"menu board\" and \"man.\"\n*   **Combining Details:** It describes the video as a continuous sequence rather than a series of static frames.\n*   **Describing Transitions:** It effectively explains the shift between scenes (\"As the video progresses, the focus shifts...\") and the subject's disappearance (\"The man gradually disappears...\").\n*   **Natural Language:** The writing is fluent, simple, and clear.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n1.  **Use of a Forbidden Term:** The instruction explicitly states, \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.\" The caption violates this rule by saying, \"The man gradually disappears from the **frame**...\" A better alternative would be \"The man gradually disappears from view\" or \"The man walks out of sight.\"\n2.  **Subjective Interpretation:** The instruction states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\" and to avoid describing what is not visible. The final clause, \"...**emphasizing** the spacious and contemporary setting,\" is a subjective interpretation of the filmmaker's intent. The caption should only describe what is seen, not the effect it is intended to create. A more objective description would simply end after describing the man's action.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good** because it is accurate, mostly complete, and follows the temporal structure of the video well. However, it is not perfect due to two specific violations of the instructions: using the forbidden word \"frame\" and including a subjective interpretation of the scene's purpose. Correcting these two minor issues would make the caption fully compliant with all the given rules.",
