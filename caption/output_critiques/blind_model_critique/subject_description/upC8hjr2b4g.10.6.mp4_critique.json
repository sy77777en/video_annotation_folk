    "pre_caption": "This video features an architectural scenery shot of a long, empty hallway, creating a sterile and unsettling atmosphere. The entire scene is bathed in a cold, monochromatic blue-green light, with the primary illumination coming from a large, brightly lit, multi-paned window at the far end of the corridor. This light reflects faintly on the polished tile floor, emphasizing the length and emptiness of the space. The symmetrical composition, with recessed doorways or alcoves on either side, contributes to the institutional and slightly ominous feel. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the environment and the powerful, clinical mood it evokes, using the vacant space to suggest isolation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a long hallway lit by a window at the far end, it misses several key visual details and violates the instruction to avoid subjective language. The description uses terms like \"sterile,\" \"unsettling,\" and \"ominous\" to describe the atmosphere, instead of focusing on the objective visual facts that create that feeling. For instance, it fails to mention that the light from the window is so bright it completely blows out the details of what is outside, rendering it a pure white rectangle, and that this intense light casts long, sharp-edged shadows from the doorways that stretch across the polished floor. The caption also describes the hallway as \"empty,\" but the video clearly shows a red, coiled fire hose mounted on the wall between the second and third doorways on the right, which provides a solitary point of color in the otherwise monochromatic scene. Furthermore, the description neglects to mention the state of the walls, which are not smooth but are made of large, pale concrete blocks with visible grout lines, contributing a rough texture that contrasts with the smooth floor. Lastly, the caption omits any mention of motion; the video is not a static shot but a slow, almost imperceptible push-in towards the window, which subtly alters the perspective and the length of the shadows over time.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video presents a long hallway illuminated by a large, brightly lit window at the far end, which appears as a pure white rectangle due to the intense light. This light casts long, sharp-edged shadows from the doorways across the polished tile floor. The scene is predominantly monochromatic, with a red, coiled fire hose mounted on the wall between the second and third doorways on the right, providing a solitary point of color. The walls are constructed of large, pale concrete blocks with visible grout lines, adding a rough texture that contrasts with the smooth floor. The video features a slow, subtle push-in towards the window, gradually altering the perspective and the length of the shadows, emphasizing the corridor's depth and structure.",
