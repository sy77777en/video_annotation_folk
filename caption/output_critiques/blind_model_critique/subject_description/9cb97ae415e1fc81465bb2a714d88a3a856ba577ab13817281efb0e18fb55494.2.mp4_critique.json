    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a landscape shot of a park. The descriptions of the \"expansive green lawn,\" \"bare trees,\" \"golden sunlight,\" and \"long shadows\" are precise and verifiable visual details. Mentioning the background elements like the road, vehicles, and buildings is also accurate.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete. For a scenery shot without a primary subject, it successfully fulfills the instruction to describe the overall environment. It captures all the key elements—the lawn, trees, light, and background—and explains why the focus is on the atmosphere rather than a specific subject, which is exactly what the instructions require for this type of video.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the rules.\n\n*   **Format and Conciseness:** It is a single, coherent paragraph, written in clear and natural English. It avoids introductory text and Markdown.\n*   **Focus on Scenery:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and follows the specific instructions for this scenario by explaining that the \"emphasis is on the environment and the tranquil atmosphere.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption mostly uses objective, descriptive language (\"expansive green,\" \"bare trees,\" \"golden sunlight\").\n    *   **Minor Point of Improvement:** The words \"serene\" and \"tranquil\" lean towards subjective, emotional description. While the instructions for scenery shots do allow for describing the \"atmosphere,\" a stricter interpretation would favor more neutral terms. However, in this context, they function effectively to describe the overall mood of the scene without focusing on a specific subject's emotion, making this a very minor issue.\n*   **Avoidance of Forbidden Terms:** The caption successfully avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or references to specific moments in time.\n*   **Handling of Inferences:** The phrase \"suggesting a late autumn or early spring atmosphere\" is an excellent way to handle an inference. It is based on a clear visual cue (\"bare trees\") but is phrased cautiously, which aligns with the instruction to \"avoid describing what you are unsure about.\"\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the elements present (\"lawn,\" \"trees,\" \"vehicles,\" \"buildings\") and appropriately designates them as secondary to the overall scene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is very good. It perfectly follows the specialized instructions for describing a scenery shot, providing a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the video's content and focus. The minor point about subjective adjectives is debatable and does not significantly detract from the overall high quality of the caption.",
