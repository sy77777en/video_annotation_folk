Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is not good. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately identifies the general content of a likely underwater video (coral, fish, blue water). It correctly classifies it as a scenery shot where the environment is the focus.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete because it lacks the specific visual details required by the instructions.\n*   It mentions a \"coral formation\" but provides no details about its color, shape, or texture.\n*   It describes the fish as \"small, colorful\" but fails to give any specific colors, shapes, or markings that would help identify them. The instructions explicitly ask for \"key visual attributes in detail.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption fails to follow several key instructions:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly with words like \"vibrant,\" \"rich,\" \"dynamic,\" \"lively,\" and \"beauty.\" These words describe an impression or feeling rather than objective visual facts.\n\n2.  **Conciseness and Redundancy:** The instructions ask for a \"concise\" description. The caption is repetitive. The first sentence identifies it as an \"underwater scenery shot,\" and the last sentence explains *why* it's a scenery shot (\"The emphasis is on the ecosystem's beauty and scale, rather than a specific object...\"). This explanation is redundant and makes the paragraph less concise.\n\n3.  **Lack of Detail:** The core instruction is to \"describe its key visual attributes in detail.\" The caption is far too general. \"Colorful fish\" and \"coral formation\" are vague descriptions that do not meet the required level of specificity.\n\n4.  **Meta-Commentary:** The caption begins with \"The video is...\", which is a form of meta-commentary. The instructions prefer a direct description of the scene itself, as if the reader is looking at it, rather than a description of the video as a media object.\n\nIn summary, the caption correctly identifies the scene type but fails on the most critical instructions regarding objectivity, detail, and conciseness. It reads more like a promotional summary than the objective, detailed description requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A vast underwater scene reveals a sprawling coral formation, predominantly orange with intricate, branching structures and a rough, textured surface. Surrounding the coral, a variety of fish dart through the clear blue water. Among them, small yellow tangs with bright, lemon-colored bodies and distinctive triangular fins swim alongside parrotfish, identifiable by their vibrant green and blue scales and beak-like mouths. The scene captures the intricate details and diverse species of this marine ecosystem.",
