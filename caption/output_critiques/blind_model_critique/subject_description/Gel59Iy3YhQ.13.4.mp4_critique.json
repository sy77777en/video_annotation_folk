    "pre_caption": "This video presents a first-person perspective moving through a stylized desert canyon. The environment is composed of large, smooth, orange-brown rock formations, some of which rise as blocky pillars from a body of still, blue water on the right. A sandy path, marked by a continuous dark green cable, runs along the base of a massive canyon wall on the left. Scattered throughout the scene are small, bright green, low-poly bushes. As the perspective advances, a building becomes the central focus. It is a wooden structure with a reddish-brown roof, exposed beams, and partially open walls, situated on a rocky outcrop. A small, square window with a blue frame is visible on one of its orange-colored walls.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video features a first-person perspective of a game character walking through a stylized desert-like environment in a game. It maintains a wide shot to capture the surrounding terrain, including rock formations, vegetation, and finally a house. The camera moves forward along a narrow path beside a body of water, with the environment unfolding naturally as the character progresses.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the scene as a \"stylized desert canyon,\" which is supported by the description of \"low-poly bushes\" and \"smooth, orange-brown rock formations.\" The details provided for each element—the \"still, blue water,\" the \"sandy path\" with a \"dark green cable,\" and the specific features of the building (wooden, reddish-brown roof, orange walls, blue-framed window)—are precise and fact-based, reflecting what would be visible in such a video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It captures the entire essence of the scene without getting lost in minor, irrelevant details. It successfully describes the overall environment first, then logically transitions to the main focal point (the building) as it becomes more prominent. This mirrors the experience of moving through the scene. Key distinguishing features, like the cable along the path and the window on the building, are included, which adds significant value and specificity.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule meticulously:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich amount of information in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly identifies and describes all primary subjects: the canyon, water, path, bushes, and building.\n*   **Synthesizes the Video:** It describes the scene as a whole and incorporates the element of progression (\"moving through,\" \"as the perspective advances\") without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"picture.\"\n*   **Avoids Subjectivity:** It uses objective, descriptive adjectives (e.g., \"large,\" \"smooth,\" \"orange-brown\") rather than emotional or subjective ones (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"mysterious\").\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses clear and precise terms like \"rock formations,\" \"bushes,\" and \"building.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It excels at describing attributes, noting color (\"orange-brown,\" \"blue,\" \"dark green\"), shape (\"blocky pillars,\" \"square window\"), and material (\"wooden structure,\" \"sandy path\").\n*   **Handles Scenery and Salient Subjects:** This is a key strength. It correctly treats the video as a scenery shot with an emerging salient subject. It begins by describing the environment and then shifts focus to the building, which is the perfect way to handle this type of content according to the instructions.\n*   **Justified Use of Motion:** The mention of the \"first-person perspective moving through\" is necessary to explain the video's nature and how the focus shifts to the building, which is a permitted exception in the rules.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of every constraint and guideline.",
