    "pre_caption": "This is a landscape scenery shot capturing a dramatic time-lapse of a sunset over a vast canyon. The expansive canyon, with its layered rock formations, is cast in deep shadow, while a thin, reflective river winds through its base. The sky is a spectacle of contrasting elements: on the left, the setting sun creates a brilliant golden-orange glow with visible sunbeams, while on the right, dark, voluminous storm clouds gather, with rain visibly falling in the distance. The clouds drift across the frame as the sun sinks, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale of the natural environment and the powerful, atmospheric conditions, emphasizing the grandeur of the landscape rather than any single object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a landscape time-lapse and outlines the main components, it relies heavily on subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"spectacle,\" \"brilliant,\" and \"powerful,\" which the instructions prohibit. The description should be more objective; for instance, instead of a \"brilliant golden-orange glow,\" it could state \"a concentrated area of golden-orange light.\" Furthermore, the final sentence explaining the absence of a main subject is redundant and overly long, as the initial classification as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and the subsequent description already convey this. The caption could be improved by adding more specific visual details that would likely be present in such a video. For example, it could describe the colors of the canyon's layered rock as ranging from deep red to light brown, and note how the lengthening shadows progressively obscure these details during the time-lapse. It also misses the opportunity to describe the changing colors of the sky away from the sun, which would likely shift from blue to shades of pink and purple as the sun sets. Finally, while it mentions \"sunbeams,\" it could be more precise by describing them as crepuscular rays fanning out from the horizon.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This landscape time-lapse captures a sunset over a vast canyon, highlighting the natural environment's immense scale. The canyon's layered rock formations display a range of colors from deep red to light brown, gradually obscured by lengthening shadows. A thin, reflective river winds through the canyon's base. The sky features contrasting elements: on the left, a concentrated area of golden-orange light from the setting sun, with crepuscular rays fanning out from the horizon. On the right, dark storm clouds gather, with rain visibly falling in the distance. As the sun sinks, the sky transitions from blue to shades of pink and purple, while clouds drift across the frame, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow.",
