    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** This is a cityscape scenery shot.\n\n**Explanation Paragraph:** The video focuses on capturing the urban environment and atmosphere rather than a specific main subject. It presents a street-level view featuring a modern frosted glass barrier atop a dark stone wall juxtaposed with older, weathered building facades. One building has a pale green, graffiti-covered door adorned with posters, while the adjacent one features a large window covered by light curtains and displaying small signs. The emphasis is on the overall scene, textures, and architectural contrast, characteristic of a scenery shot where the environment itself is the focus.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe provided caption is **not good** because it fails to follow the core instructions. The one-sentence caption is overly simplistic, while the separate explanation paragraph contains the actual description that should have been the caption itself. The goal is to produce a single, descriptive paragraph.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The classification of the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" is accurate.\n*   The details mentioned in the *explanation paragraph* (frosted glass barrier, stone wall, building facades, graffiti-covered door, posters, curtains) are accurate descriptions of the visual elements.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption \"This is a cityscape scenery shot\" is severely incomplete. It lacks the descriptive detail required by the instructions, which ask for a concise yet *informative* description of visual attributes.\n*   The *explanation paragraph*, on the other hand, is very complete. It successfully describes the key elements of the scene, their textures, and their relationship to one another, fulfilling the requirements for a scenery shot description.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Format:** The submission fails the primary formatting rule. The instructions require a **single paragraph description**, not a short caption followed by a separate explanation. The explanation paragraph should have been the final output.\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption \"This is a...\" violates the rule to avoid introductory text and return only the description. The explanation paragraph also contains explanatory phrasing (\"The video focuses on...\") rather than being a direct description. A better caption would start directly, for example: \"A street-level cityscape view features a modern frosted glass barrier...\"\n*   **Scenery Shot Rule:** The *explanation paragraph* correctly follows the special instruction for scenery shots by identifying the type (\"cityscape\"), describing the environment in detail, and explaining why there is no main subject (\"The emphasis is on the overall scene, textures, and architectural contrast...\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is poor because it is just a title and does not function as the required descriptive paragraph. The accompanying explanation contains the high-quality, detailed description that was requested, but it should have been formatted as the caption itself and edited to remove explanatory phrasing.\n\nA good caption, combining the elements from the explanation and adhering to all rules, would look like this:\n\n**A street-level cityscape view features a modern frosted glass barrier on a dark stone wall, set against older, weathered building facades. One building has a pale green, graffiti-covered door with posters on it, while the adjacent building has a large window with light curtains and small signs. The scene's focus is on the urban environment, textures, and architectural contrast rather than a specific subject.**",
