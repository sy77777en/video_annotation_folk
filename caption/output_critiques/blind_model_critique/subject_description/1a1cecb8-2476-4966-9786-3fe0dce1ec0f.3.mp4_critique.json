    "pre_caption": "The video features a person with pink hair, wearing glasses and a black mask, positioned on the far left.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a street scene with a person with pink hair, glasses, and a black mask positioned on the far left of the frame. Only part of their upper body is visible, taking up about 10% of the frame's width.**",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. While it accurately describes some visual elements, it fails to follow several key instructions, making it non-compliant and incomplete.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   The details provided about the person (pink hair, glasses, mask, position) and the background (railing, trees) are likely accurate based on the video's content. However, the caption's overall quality is poor due to other issues.\n\n### Completeness\n*   **Missing Subject Details:** The caption omits key visual attributes required by the instructions. It fails to describe the person's clothing (e.g., shirt, jacket color and style) or their visible skin tone.\n*   **Lack of Temporal Information:** The caption describes a static scene. It gives no indication of whether the person or camera moves, if there are shot transitions, or if the subject's state changes over the course of the video. The instruction to \"combine details from the frames\" implies a description of the video's progression, which is missing.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption violates several explicit rules from the instructions:\n\n*   **Forbidden Terminology:** It directly violates the rule \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'\" by using the phrase \"frame's width.\"\n*   **Unnecessary Background Description:** It describes the \"street backdrop with a decorative metal railing and trees.\" The instructions state to avoid describing the background unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects. Since only one person is described, these background details are superfluous.\n*   **Unnatural Language:** The phrase \"occupying about 10% of the frame's width\" is overly technical and not the \"simple, natural English\" requested. A more natural description would be something like, \"A small part of their body is visible on the far left.\"\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which acts as introductory text. The instructions require returning \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The description should start directly with the subject (e.g., \"A person with pink hair...\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A person with pink hair, wearing glasses and a black mask, is visible on the far left. They are wearing a blue denim jacket over a white t-shirt, and their skin tone is light. The person is facing forward with their head slightly turned to the right. Throughout the video, the person remains stationary, and there are no camera movements or transitions.",
