    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot, capturing a vibrant urban intersection bordered by lush green trees and a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The scene features a wide, clean sidewalk with a tactile paving strip, black metal railings, and various street signs and traffic cones, while several vehicles, including white and red cars, are visible on the road. The focus is on the overall environment, highlighting the harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and natural elements, rather than emphasizing any single object or individual. There is no main subject because the intent is to convey the atmosphere and scale of the cityscape, immersing the viewer in the setting itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good. It effectively and accurately describes the video while adhering closely to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is successful:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and provides a comprehensive list of the visible elements: an urban intersection, trees, sky, clouds, sidewalk, railings, street signs, cones, and vehicles. It includes specific visual attributes for these subjects (e.g., \"lush green trees,\" \"bright blue sky,\" \"black metal railings,\" \"white and red cars\"), making the description vivid and precise.\n\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly follows the specific rule for scenery shots. It begins by identifying the type of shot (\"cityscape scenery shot\") and concludes with a clear, two-sentence explanation for the absence of a main subject, stating that the focus is on the \"overall environment,\" \"atmosphere,\" and \"scale.\"\n    *   **Conciseness and Format:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph, written in simple, natural English. It avoids markdown and unnecessary introductory text.\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Objectivity:** For the most part, it uses objective language. While words like \"vibrant,\" \"lush,\" and \"harmonious\" have a slightly subjective quality, they are used to describe the overall atmosphere of the scene, which is permissible and even encouraged by the instruction to \"convey the atmosphere\" for scenery shots. They do not describe emotions.\n    *   **Holistic Description:** The caption synthesizes the visual information into a single description of the setting, rather than detailing a sequence of events or frames.\n\nIn summary, the caption demonstrates a strong understanding of all the requirements. It is well-structured, detailed, and precisely follows the specific guidelines for describing a scenery shot without a salient subject, making it an excellent example of the desired output.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a vibrant cityscape at an urban intersection, framed by lush green trees and a bright blue sky dotted with white clouds. The scene showcases a wide, clean sidewalk featuring a tactile paving strip, black metal railings, and various street signs and traffic cones. Several vehicles, including white and red cars, traverse the road. The focus is on the harmonious blend of urban infrastructure and natural elements, immersing the viewer in the atmosphere and scale of the cityscape, rather than highlighting any single object or individual.",
