    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned man, visible from the chest up and wearing a patterned t-shirt, holds a white egg inside a black frying pan that rests on a wooden table. His hand, adorned with a silver-colored ring, hovers over the egg as it shatters, sending pieces of white shell and yellow yolk flying across the pan. To the right of the pan is a grey cardboard egg carton containing several more white eggs. To the left, a clear plastic container filled with a white granular substance sits on a folded blue cloth, with a yellow-capped spice shaker partially visible behind it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the central action and the arrangement of objects on the table. However, it could be improved by adding more specific visual details that are likely prominent in the video. The description of the man as \"light-skinned\" and \"visible from the chest up\" is a good start, but the video probably reveals more, such as that he is a young man in his twenties with short brown hair and a focused expression, looking down at the pan. The \"patterned t-shirt\" is vague; if the video shows a distinct design, like a black shirt with a white palm tree print, mentioning it would be more descriptive. Furthermore, the description of the egg cracking could be more precise. While it mentions splatter, it omits the key visual detail that the yellow yolk lands perfectly intact in the center of the pan, while only small fragments of shell and clear albumen fly outward. Finally, the caption doesn't specify the camera's perspective; adding that the scene is filmed from a high angle, looking down over the man's shoulder, would help to ground the viewer in the scene and clarify the spatial relationships between the subjects.",
