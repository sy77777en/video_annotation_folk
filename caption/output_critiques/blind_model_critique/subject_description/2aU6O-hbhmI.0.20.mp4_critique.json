Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a poor caption because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be factually accurate in describing a cityscape video centered on a large building. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"red brick and glass building\" and the setting as an \"urban environment.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is incomplete because it follows a contradictory logic. It introduces the video as a \"scenery shot\" where the focus is not on a specific subject, but then it describes a specific subject (the building) in some detail. According to the instructions, if a salient subject like a prominent building exists, the description should focus on its visual attributes. If it is truly a scenery shot, it should not describe a specific subject in detail. The caption fails to commit to either path, resulting in a description that is neither a thorough subject description nor a concise scenery overview.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption violates the instructions in several significant ways:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Language:** The instructions explicitly state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule by using phrases like \"towering presence\" and \"dynamic and immersive feel.\" More objective alternatives would be \"tall\" or describing the camera angle.\n2.  **Interpretive Language:** The caption uses interpretive language like \"emphasizing its height\" and \"The perspective highlights the scale and atmosphere.\" This describes the filmmaker's intent or the effect of the shot, not the visible content itself, which is against the instruction to describe only what is visible.\n3.  **Incorrect Scenery Shot Protocol:** The instructions for a scenery shot state that the description should be a concise paragraph of one to three sentences explaining why there is no main subject. This caption is five sentences long. More importantly, it identifies and describes a specific subject (\"a red brick and glass building\"), which contradicts the very definition of a scenery shot as described in the instructions (a shot *without* salient subjects).\n4.  **Contradictory Focus:** The caption is internally inconsistent. It states the focus is on the \"urban environment... rather than concentrating on a specific object or subject,\" but the preceding sentence does exactly that by concentrating on the \"red brick and glass building.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is poor because it is filled with forbidden subjective and interpretive language and fails to follow the structural logic required by the instructions, incorrectly blending the formats for a scenery shot and a subject-focused description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a cityscape featuring a prominent red brick and glass building. The focus is on the building's architectural details, such as its vertical lines and height, within the urban environment. The shot provides a clear view of the building's integration with surrounding city structures, using lighting and angles to highlight its presence.",
