    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling street scene outside a shop with several people and bicycles. A woman with long, light brown hair, wearing a tan jacket and black shorts, is walking past the shop. Another woman with long, dark hair, dressed in a white outfit, stands nearby, facing the shop window. A man in a black sweater and dark pants is seen walking away from the shop, while another man in a white shirt is visible in the background. Several bicycles are parked along the shop's exterior, which is adorned with traditional lanterns and signs. The scene captures a lively and casual atmosphere with people engaged in everyday activities.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a decent overview of the subjects present, but it lacks the specificity and focus that the video contains. For instance, the camera actively follows the woman in the tan jacket as she walks from left to right while looking at her phone, establishing her as the primary subject, which the caption fails to convey by listing her as one of several people. The description of other subjects is also too static; the woman in the white dress is not just standing but is animatedly pointing at an item in the shop window, and the two men in the background are seated at a small outdoor table, with one actively drinking from a cup. Furthermore, the caption misses key details that would add clarity, such as the fact that the shop's 'traditional lanterns' are large, red paper lanterns and the 'bicycles' are a mix of modern rental bikes and older models, one with a basket of groceries. Finally, the concluding sentence about the 'lively and casual atmosphere' is a subjective interpretation, which the instructions explicitly advise against, and should be removed in favor of more objective descriptions of the subjects' actions.",
