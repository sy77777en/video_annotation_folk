    "pre_caption": "This video shows a first-person perspective from the video game Minecraft, focusing on the construction of a large, curved structure high in the sky. The structure is made of smooth, white blocks and is built in a stepped, layered fashion, creating a sweeping arc. The player is actively adding to the structure, as seen from the viewpoint of holding a white block. At the bottom of the screen, an inventory bar displays a selection of available blocks, including white, light blue, diamond, red, and black blocks, as well as a red flower. In the top-left corner, a small avatar of the player character is visible, showing a figure with light skin, brown hair, a green shirt, and blue pants.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to all the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the video as a first-person perspective from the video game *Minecraft*, which is crucial context for understanding the visual elements. It accurately describes the main activity (construction), the subject being built (a large, curved, white structure), the player's immediate action (holding a white block), and the specific user interface elements visible (the inventory bar and the player avatar), including the correct colors and items shown.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, capturing all the essential visual information without being overly long. It covers:\n*   **Main Subject:** The structure is described in detail, including its shape, color, material (implied by \"blocks\"), and construction style (\"stepped, layered\").\n*   **Player Action:** The first-person perspective and the action of placing a block are clearly stated.\n*   **Secondary Subjects:** The UI elements, which are static but important parts of the scene, are fully described. The inventory bar's contents and the avatar's appearance are detailed with precision.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand while remaining informative.\n*   **Vocabulary:** It successfully avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and refrains from using subjective, emotional adjectives.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"structure,\" \"blocks,\" \"inventory bar,\" \"avatar\") and correctly identifies the subjects.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific visual attributes for each subject, such as the structure's shape (\"curved,\" \"sweeping arc\"), the blocks' colors, and the avatar's appearance (\"light skin, brown hair, a green shirt, and blue pants\").\n*   **Subject Prioritization:** The description is logically ordered, starting with the main focus of the video (the construction) before moving to the secondary UI elements.\n*   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific moments or frames.",
