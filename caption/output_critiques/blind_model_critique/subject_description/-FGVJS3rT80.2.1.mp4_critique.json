    "pre_caption": "The video features a black and white booster stage with vertical stripes and a curved top, positioned in the foreground. A silver rocket with a round shape and a circular opening at its top separates from the booster, moving away into space. As the rocket detaches, bright flames and bursts of light are visible at its base. The rocket becomes more distant as it travels further from the booster, and both objects are seen against the backdrop of Earth, with blue oceans and white clouds visible below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows a rocket separating from its booster stage in space. The booster stage is black and white with vertical stripes and a curved top, while the rocket is silver and round with a circular opening at the top. As the rocket moves away from the booster, flames burst from its bottom. In the background, Earth is visible with its blue oceans and white clouds.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the core event of a stage separation against the backdrop of Earth, but it lacks precision and omits several key visual details. The description of the separating craft as a \"silver rocket with a round shape and a circular opening at its top\" is confusing; the video actually shows a cylindrical upper stage with a conical nose cone, and the \"opening\" is the large, bell-shaped engine nozzle at its base, from which a sustained, brilliant white plume erupts upon ignition, not just \"bursts of light.\" The description of the booster is also incomplete. While it is black and white with vertical stripes, the video clearly shows four prominent grid fins deploying from its sides moments after separation, and the booster itself begins a slow, controlled tumble as it falls away. Furthermore, the caption understates the dramatic view of the Earth; the video features a prominent, sharp curvature of the planet, with the thin, glowing blue line of the atmosphere distinctly visible against the blackness of space, which is a more defining feature than simply \"blue oceans and white clouds.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a black and white booster stage with vertical stripes, prominently featuring four grid fins deploying from its sides as it begins a slow, controlled tumble after separation. In the foreground, a cylindrical upper stage with a conical nose cone detaches from the booster, revealing a large, bell-shaped engine nozzle at its base. Upon ignition, a sustained, brilliant white plume erupts from the nozzle, propelling the upper stage away into space. The dramatic backdrop highlights the sharp curvature of Earth, with a thin, glowing blue line of the atmosphere distinctly visible against the blackness of space, enhancing the view of the blue oceans and white clouds below.",
