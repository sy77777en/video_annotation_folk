    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the video shows a person with fair skin looking down. Their bare foot, with red-painted toenails, is visible at the bottom of the frame, along with the hem of their blue pants. The view shifts to a carpeted staircase with wooden banisters on either side. At the bottom of the stairs, a small, white-and-black object, possibly a stuffed animal or a small pet, is sitting. A wavy, distorting visual effect is applied to the scene, and the person's hand briefly enters the frame from the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but contains a few clear violations of the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate. It describes a plausible sequence of events from a first-person point of view, identifying subjects (a person, a staircase, an ambiguous object) and their key visual attributes (skin tone, clothing color, toenail polish, staircase material). It correctly handles ambiguity by noting that the object could be a \"stuffed animal or a small pet.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully combines details from what seems to be a continuous shot, describing the initial view, the movement of the camera (\"the view shifts\"), the appearance of a new subject (\"person's hand briefly enters\"), and a notable visual effect (\"wavy, distorting visual effect\"). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some issues.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"person,\" \"foot,\" \"staircase,\" and \"banisters.\" It also handles ambiguity well, as instructed.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific visual details, such as \"fair skin,\" \"red-painted toenails,\" \"blue pants,\" \"carpeted staircase,\" and \"wooden banisters.\"\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific moments in time (e.g., \"in the first second\"). The phrase \"The view shifts\" is an excellent way to describe camera motion as instructed.\n*   **No Subjective Language:** The caption avoids emotional or subjective adjectives.\n\n**Where it fails:**\n*   **Use of Forbidden Terms:** The instructions explicitly state, \"**avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'.**\" The caption violates this rule twice:\n    1.  \"...is visible at the bottom of the **frame**...\"\n    2.  \"...briefly enters the **frame** from the right.\"\n    This is the most significant error in the caption. These phrases could be reworded to \"is visible at the bottom of the view\" and \"briefly enters from the right.\"\n\n*   **Minor Stylistic Issues:** The phrase \"the video shows\" is slightly meta. While not explicitly forbidden, a more direct description like \"From a first-person perspective, a person with fair skin looks down...\" would better align with the instruction to create a simple, natural description of the content itself.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is well-written in terms of its descriptive quality, completeness, and handling of ambiguity. However, it is **not a good caption** because it fails to follow a critical negative constraint: the explicit prohibition of the word \"frame.\" This violation makes it non-compliant with the provided instructions.",
