    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the video shows a person with fair skin looking down. Their bare foot, with red-painted toenails, is visible at the bottom of the frame, along with the hem of their blue pants. The view shifts to a carpeted staircase with wooden banisters on either side. At the bottom of the stairs, a small, white-and-black object, possibly a stuffed animal or a small pet, is sitting. A wavy, distorting visual effect is applied to the scene, and the person's hand briefly enters the frame from the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and the core action of walking towards a staircase. However, it could be improved by being more definitive and adhering more strictly to the instructions. The phrase \"at the bottom of the frame\" should be removed; instead, the description could state that the downward view captures the person's feet. The caption's uncertainty about the \"small, white-and-black object\" is a significant issue; if the video shows even subtle movements like breathing or a tail twitch, it should be confidently identified as a small pet, such as a tuxedo cat, rather than speculating that it could be a stuffed animal. Furthermore, the description of \"their bare foot\" is ambiguous—if both feet are bare and visible as the person walks, this should be specified for clarity. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the flooring the person walks on before reaching the stairs, which, if it were a contrasting material like hardwood, would add valuable context. Finally, while mentioning the \"wavy, distorting visual effect\" is crucial, placing it at the end makes it feel secondary. Integrating it earlier would better convey that the entire scene is viewed through this distorted lens.",

Both of their bare feet, with red-painted toenails, are visible as they step across a hardwood floor. The scene is viewed through a wavy, distorting visual effect, adding a surreal quality to the movement. The view shifts to a carpeted staircase with wooden banisters on either side.
