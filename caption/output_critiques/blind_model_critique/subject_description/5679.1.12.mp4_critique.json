    "pre_caption": "The video features a man standing on a wooden bridge in a forested area. He is wearing an orange jacket and a matching hat, with beige shorts and red shoes. The man has a medium skin tone and a beard. He is facing the camera, gesturing with his hands, and appears to be engaged in some form of communication or expression. The lush greenery of the forest surrounds the bridge, providing a natural backdrop to the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the provided rules:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video matches the description, the caption is factually accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a man and accurately describes his clothing (orange jacket and hat, beige shorts, red shoes), physical attributes (medium skin tone, beard), and location (on a wooden bridge).\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete but has one notable omission. While it details the man's clothing, skin tone, and facial hair, it fails to mention his **hairstyle**, which is a required attribute for describing people according to the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption violates several core instructions:\n\n*   **Describing the Background:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary.\" The caption mentions the \"wooden bridge\" and \"forested area,\" which is acceptable for context. However, the final sentence, \"The lush greenery of the forest surrounds the bridge, providing a natural backdrop to the scene,\" is entirely dedicated to describing the background and is not necessary for identifying the subject. This is a clear violation.\n*   **Using Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives.\" The word **\"lush\"** to describe the greenery is subjective. A more objective description would focus on color and density (e.g., \"dense green foliage\").\n*   **Describing What is Unsure:** The instruction is to \"avoid describing what you are unsure about.\" The phrase **\"appears to be engaged in some form of communication or expression\"** is an interpretation of the man's actions, not a direct observation. A more compliant description would stick to the observable action: \"He is gesturing with his hands.\"\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption begins with \"The video features a man...\" This introductory phrase is unnecessary and reduces conciseness. A better caption would start directly with the subject, such as \"A man stands on a wooden bridge...\"\n\nIn summary, while the caption is accurate, it is incomplete and breaks fundamental rules regarding the description of the background, the use of subjective language, and speculation about the subject's intent.",
