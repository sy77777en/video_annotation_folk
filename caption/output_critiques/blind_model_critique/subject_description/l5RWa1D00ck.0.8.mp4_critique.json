    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned man, appearing to be in his late 20s or early 30s, stands outdoors at dusk. He has dark, neatly styled hair parted on the side and is clean-shaven. He wears a dark jacket over a white collared shirt that is unbuttoned at the top. Initially looking forward with a faint smile, he then turns to his side and gestures with his hands open and palms up. In the background, a vintage, light-colored bus with a rounded front drives into the scene from the left.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the man and the buses, it misses key specifics and dynamic elements that provide context to the scene. The \"dark jacket\" is more accurately a black leather jacket, which complements the vintage aesthetic of the buses. Similarly, the \"light-colored buses\" are distinctly a cream-white and a pale seafoam green, with shiny chrome trim and large, curved windows that are characteristic of 1950s models. The description of the man's pose is too static; he doesn't just stand with a faint smile, but rather begins by looking at the camera and then turns his head to glance toward the green bus, his expression shifting from a simple smile to one of fond admiration. His \"hands open, palms up\" gesture is not a passive pose but an active, sweeping motion toward the vehicles, as if he is presenting them. Crucially, the caption omits that the headlights on the cream-white bus are illuminated, casting a warm, focused glow that contrasts with the cool, fading light of dusk and suggests the buses are functional, not just parked props. This interaction between the man's gesture and the illuminated bus implies a relationship—perhaps he is a guide or owner—that the current caption fails to convey.",
