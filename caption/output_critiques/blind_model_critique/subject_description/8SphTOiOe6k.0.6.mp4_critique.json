    "pre_caption": "This video presents a streetscape scenery shot of a quiet Japanese town on a bright, sunny day. There is no single main subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to capture the overall atmosphere and environment of the location rather than focusing on a particular person or object. The scene is characterized by traditional Japanese architecture, with buildings featuring dark tiled roofs and wooden facades, one of which has a prominent red awning on its upper floor. A few pedestrians stroll along the sidewalk, and a white van is parked near a small outdoor seating area. In the background, green mountains rise against a brilliant blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds, enhancing the tranquil and picturesque quality of the townscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the setting as a Japanese town, it misclassifies the video as a scenery shot without a main subject and includes subjective interpretations contrary to the instructions. The video clearly features several salient subjects that require more detailed description. For instance, the \"few pedestrians\" are not described; one is an older woman in a beige jacket carrying a white shopping bag, and another is a young man in a dark suit walking while looking down at a phone. The \"white van\" is a specific model, a Suzuki Every, and is parked parallel to the curb directly in front of a storefront with blue *noren* curtains, not just \"near\" a seating area. The caption also misses key architectural details, describing buildings generally as \"traditional\" but failing to mention the visible dark wooden lattice work on the ground floor windows or the grey stone foundation of the building with the red awning. Furthermore, the description uses prohibited subjective adjectives like \"quiet,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"picturesque.\" Instead of stating the town is \"quiet,\" it should describe the observable evidence, such as the absence of vehicle traffic and the slow pace of the pedestrians. The opening sentence, which analyzes the camera's purpose, is meta-commentary and should be removed in favor of a direct description of the scene's contents.",
