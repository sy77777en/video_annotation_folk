    "pre_caption": "The video captures a bustling street scene with various people and vehicles. Several individuals, including men and women, are walking along the sidewalk. They are dressed in casual attire, with some wearing jackets and face masks. A notable feature is a silver car driving down the street, with a visible license plate. The street is lined with traditional-style buildings, and a few people are seen near a shop entrance. The overall atmosphere is lively, with a mix of pedestrians and vehicles moving through the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The provided caption is a good starting point but lacks the specific detail and objectivity required by the instructions. While it correctly identifies the main subject types (people, vehicles, buildings), it relies on generalities and subjective language. For instance, describing the scene as \"bustling\" and the atmosphere as \"lively\" violates the rule to avoid subjective adjectives. The description of the people is too vague; instead of just \"casual attire, wearing jackets and face masks,\" it should specify details like \"a woman with long black hair wearing a beige trench coat over a black sweater\" or \"a man in a blue puffer jacket and jeans,\" as these details would likely be visible. The description of the vehicles is also confusing; it mentions \"a silver car\" twice without clarifying if it is the same vehicle or distinguishing them by model (e.g., \"a silver sedan,\" \"a silver SUV\"). Mentioning that a license plate is \"visible\" is redundant unless the plate's details are provided. Furthermore, the description of \"traditional-style buildings\" could be more concrete by mentioning specific features like \"buildings with gray-tiled hip-and-gable roofs and wooden lattice windows.\" A better caption would eliminate interpretive words and instead build a sense of a busy scene through a more precise and detailed account of the individual subjects and their actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a street scene with various people and vehicles. A woman with long black hair is wearing a beige trench coat over a black sweater, while a man in a blue puffer jacket and jeans walks nearby. Another individual is seen in a red hoodie and black pants. A silver sedan drives down the street, and a silver SUV is parked along the curb. The street is lined with buildings featuring gray-tiled hip-and-gable roofs and wooden lattice windows. Near a shop entrance, a group of people is gathered, some carrying shopping bags. The scene is filled with pedestrians and vehicles moving through the area.",
