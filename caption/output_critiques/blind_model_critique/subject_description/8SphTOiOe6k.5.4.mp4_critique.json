    "pre_caption": "The video captures a bustling street scene with various people and vehicles. Several individuals, including men and women, are walking along the sidewalk. They are dressed in casual attire, with some wearing jackets and face masks. A notable feature is a silver car driving down the street, with a visible license plate. The street is lined with traditional-style buildings, and a few people are seen near a shop entrance. The overall atmosphere is lively, with a mix of pedestrians and vehicles moving through the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption fails to meet the requirements, focusing on accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### 1. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption violates several key instructions:\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses words like \"**bustling**\" and \"**lively**\" to describe the scene and atmosphere. These are subjective interpretations of the scene's energy, not objective visual descriptions.\n*   **Lack of Detailed Visual Attributes:** The core of the instruction is to \"describe its key visual attributes in detail.\" The caption is extremely general.\n    *   It says people are in \"**casual attire**\" and \"**some wearing jackets**\" but fails to mention any specific colors, styles, or other distinguishing features (e.g., \"a man in a black puffer jacket,\" \"a woman in a tan coat\").\n    *   It mentions a \"**silver car**\" but provides no other details like its type (sedan, SUV), make, or other features, which would be more descriptive.\n*   **Failure to Distinguish Between Subjects:** The instructions require distinguishing between multiple subjects of the same type (e.g., \"the man on the left,\" \"the woman in the red dress\"). The caption groups everyone together as \"**several individuals**,\" \"**men and women**,\" and \"**a few people**\" without providing any details to tell them apart.\n*   **Unnecessary Description of Background/Atmosphere:** The caption opens with \"**a bustling street scene**\" and ends with \"**The overall atmosphere is lively**.\" The instructions state to avoid mentioning the background unless necessary to distinguish subjects. Here, it's used to set a mood, which is contrary to the objective-focused instructions. The mention of \"**traditional-style buildings**\" is also a subjective interpretation of architecture.\n*   **Editorializing:** The phrase \"**A notable feature is...**\" is a form of subjective emphasis. The instructions require a neutral, direct description, not highlighting what the writer finds \"notable.\"\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits the specific details required by the instructions. A good caption would have included:\n\n*   Specific colors and types of clothing for the pedestrians.\n*   More details about the car beyond its color.\n*   Descriptions of individual people, even if brief, to differentiate them (e.g., \"A man in a dark jacket and a white face mask walks past a woman with long dark hair wearing a light-colored coat.\").\n\n### 3. Accuracy\n\nWhile the caption is not factually inaccurate (there are people, a car, and buildings), its lack of specificity makes it a poor representation of the visual information. It describes a generic street scene that could apply to thousands of different videos, rather than the specific subjects in this one.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption fails because it opts for a general, atmospheric summary instead of the detailed, objective, and subject-focused description demanded by the instructions. It violates the rules against subjective language, lacks the required level of detail for visual attributes, and does not distinguish between individual subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a street scene with various people and vehicles. On the sidewalk, a man in a black puffer jacket and a white face mask walks alongside a woman with long dark hair wearing a tan coat. Another individual, a woman in a red scarf, stands near a shop entrance. A silver sedan with a visible license plate drives down the street. The street is lined with buildings featuring traditional architectural elements.",
