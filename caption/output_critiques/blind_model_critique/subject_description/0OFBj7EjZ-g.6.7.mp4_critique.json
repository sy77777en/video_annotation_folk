    "pre_caption": "The video features a sleek, angular object with a futuristic design, resembling a stylized, abstract sculpture. It has a metallic surface with a reflective finish, displaying a combination of dark and light tones that shift as the object rotates. The object is suspended on a thin, vertical green rod, giving it a floating appearance. Its shape is asymmetrical, with sharp edges and smooth curves, creating a dynamic and modern aesthetic. The object’s orientation changes, highlighting its multifaceted structure and intricate design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively captures the essence of the video while adhering to most of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a rotating, abstract, metallic object. The details provided—such as \"sleek, angular,\" \"metallic surface,\" \"reflective finish,\" \"suspended on a thin, vertical green rod,\" and its \"asymmetrical\" shape—create a precise and clear mental image that aligns with the described subject.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It covers the subject's form (\"angular,\" \"sharp edges,\" \"smooth curves\"), material (\"metallic\"), surface quality (\"reflective\"), color properties (\"dark and light tones that shift\"), and its state (\"suspended,\" \"rotates\"). It successfully paints a full picture of the single, central subject.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions well, with only minor deviations:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is succinct yet packed with relevant visual information.\n    *   **Focus on Subject:** It correctly focuses entirely on the main object and its key attributes.\n    *   **Combined Details:** It describes the object's rotation (\"orientation changes\") as a continuous action, successfully summarizing the video without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Clear Subject Identification:** It appropriately identifies the subject as an \"object\" and uses a helpful analogy (\"resembling a stylized, abstract sculpture\") since a more precise term is not available.\n    *   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** The description of the object's shape, surface, and structure is specific and descriptive.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives.\" The caption uses words like \"sleek,\" \"futuristic,\" \"dynamic,\" and \"modern aesthetic.\" While these words help create a vivid picture, they are interpretive rather than purely objective. For example, \"futuristic\" is a judgment of the object's style. A stricter adherence would focus only on observable facts like shape and material.\n    *   **Describing Action:** The caption uses the word \"rotates.\" The instruction says to avoid \"motion\" unless necessary. While the rotation is the key action that reveals the object's form, a more pedantic interpretation of the rule might favor the alternative phrasing used later in the caption: \"The object’s orientation changes.\" However, in this context, its use is justifiable and effective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, the caption is excellent. It is well-written, accurate, and highly descriptive. The minor use of subjective language is its only significant deviation from the instructions, but it serves to make the description more evocative. The caption successfully fulfills its primary goal of providing a clear and concise description of the video's subject.",
