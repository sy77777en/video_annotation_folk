    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It effectively follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description (assuming it matches the video content). It uses precise terms like \"dirt bike\" and provides specific colors for the bike (\"orange and white\") and the rider's gear (\"white helmet with blue and red accents,\" \"red and black... top,\" \"black pants,\" \"black boots\"). By identifying the subject as \"a person,\" it avoids making assumptions about gender, which is appropriate if the rider's features are obscured by the helmet.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is complete, focusing on the most salient subjects—the person and the dirt bike. It provides a thorough list of the key visual attributes for the rider's attire and the bike's appearance. It correctly omits details that are likely not visible, such as the rider's facial features, hair, or skin tone, thus adhering to the rule of not describing what is uncertain.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption successfully adheres to the specific rules outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is short yet packed with essential details.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It describes only the rider and the bike, correctly ignoring the background as it is not needed for context.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective adjectives and describes only what is visually present.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It uses precise nouns (\"person,\" \"dirt bike,\" \"helmet\") and avoids vague words. It also correctly avoids terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Structure:** It is presented as a single, coherent description. While it is two sentences, they form a logical paragraph. It could be slightly more concise by being combined into one sentence (e.g., \"A person wearing a white helmet with blue and red accents, a red and black long-sleeved top, and black pants and boots rides an orange and white dirt bike.\"), but its current form is perfectly clear and acceptable.",
