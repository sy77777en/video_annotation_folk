    "pre_caption": "A man wearing a red t-shirt, black pants, and a blue and white helmet appears riding an orange bicycle. The bike's wheels are black with a green and white stripe on the rims. The man jumps his bicycle onto a wide stone railing and then leaps off it, landing on a grassy slope below.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video is filmed from a high vantage point on a building. The background features a distant cityscape, while the foreground includes parts of the building. As the camera ascends, a man in orange enters from the bottom right, riding a bicycle. He jumps onto a stone railing and then lands on the grass below.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the action, but it could be more precise and visually descriptive. The term \"bicycle\" is too general; given the stunt, the video likely features a more specific type, such as a \"mountain bike\" or \"trials bike,\" which would be a key detail to include. The description of the action, \"jumps his bicycle onto a wide stone railing,\" is vague. In the video, the man likely performs a specific technique, such as hopping the bike sideways onto the railing, and then he might ride along it for a short distance before the final leap, a detail the caption omits. The description of the wheels having a \"green and white stripe\" seems questionable; it's more probable that the black rims feature white brand logos or text, and the \"green\" might be a fleeting reflection from the surrounding grass rather than a permanent design feature. Furthermore, the caption misses the man's physical posture and technique, such as how he shifts his body weight to maintain balance on the narrow railing or how he absorbs the impact upon landing. Describing him as \"leaning forward over the handlebars\" while on the railing would add a crucial layer of detail about his skill and control. Finally, \"appears riding\" is a weak entry; a more active description like \"A man rides into the frame from the left\" would better capture the video's opening moment.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man rides into the frame from the left, wearing a red t-shirt, black pants, and a blue and white helmet, skillfully maneuvering a trials bike. The bike's black rims display white brand logos, and any green seen is likely a reflection from the grass. He expertly hops the bike sideways onto a wide stone railing, leaning forward over the handlebars to maintain balance. After riding along the railing for a short distance, he leaps off, absorbing the impact as he lands on the grassy slope below.",
