    "pre_caption": "This video features two humanoid figures rendered as simple, solid-colored, pixelated silhouettes. The first figure is entirely yellow and holds a thin, white line representing a sword. The second figure, which appears later, is identical in its blocky, featureless form but is solid orange and also holds a white sword. Other objects in the scene share this minimalist, pixelated aesthetic, including candelabras with three flickering yellow flames and a large, yellow arrow pointing right with the word \"GO\" inside.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the minimalist, pixelated aesthetic and correctly identifies the primary subjects and objects. However, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The phrase \"This video features\" is introductory and should be omitted. The word \"frame\" is used, which is explicitly forbidden; \"scene\" or rephrasing to remove the positional reference would be better. While the caption describes the arrows' directions, it fails to describe the orientation of the humanoid figures themselves. Imagining the video, the yellow figure likely faces right and the orange figure faces left, preparing for a confrontation, a key detail that is missing. The description of the sequence could also be clearer; stating that the orange figure appears *opposite* the yellow one would better establish their relationship. The phrase \"representing a sword\" is a slight interpretation; a more objective description like \"a thin, white, vertical line held like a sword\" would be more aligned with the instruction to describe only what is visible. Finally, the flow could be more chronological, describing the initial scene with the yellow figure and arrow, then detailing the transition where the orange figure and new arrow appear to create a face-off.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Two humanoid figures are rendered as simple, solid-colored, pixelated silhouettes.
