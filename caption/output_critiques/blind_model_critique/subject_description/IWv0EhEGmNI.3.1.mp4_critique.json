    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective through green-tinted night vision, a pair of hands in light-colored gloves holds a rifle with a red dot sight. The view follows another soldier walking away from the camera. This soldier is dressed in full combat gear, including a helmet, a light-colored tactical vest with multiple pouches, and a large backpack. An icon briefly identifies their weapon as an AK-47. A body lies on the ground to the left of the walking soldier. Later, the hands in the foreground switch from the rifle to a pistol.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to almost all instructions perfectly.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the first-person perspective, the green-tinted night vision, the subjects (hands, rifle, soldier, body, pistol), their key attributes (light-colored gloves, red dot sight, combat gear), and the sequence of events (following the soldier, switching weapons). The mention of the AK-47 icon is a specific and accurate detail.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures all the salient subjects and actions in the video, providing a comprehensive overview from start to finish. It successfully combines details from the entire video into a single, coherent narrative.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is both concise and informative, using clear and simple language as instructed.\n*   **Subject-Focused Description:** It correctly focuses on describing the subjects and their visual attributes (e.g., \"hands in light-colored gloves,\" \"soldier... in full combat gear, including a helmet, a light-colored tactical vest with multiple pouches, and a large backpack\").\n*   **Holistic View:** It describes the video as a whole without referring to specific frames or using forbidden terms like \"image.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** The language is neutral and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the first-person view, the soldier being followed, and the body on the ground, using a logical order that follows the action.\n*   **Describing Transitions:** It correctly notes the key transition where the hands switch from the rifle to the pistol.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is exceptionally well-written and serves as a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and structured perfectly, resulting in a clear and comprehensive description of the video's content. There are no significant flaws.",
