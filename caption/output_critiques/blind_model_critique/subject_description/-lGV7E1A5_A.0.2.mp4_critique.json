    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the front of a vehicle featuring a prominent red and white \"Red Bull\" logo on a blue and silver surface is visible at the bottom of the view, with a pair of hands in orange and white gloves gripping the handlebars. The vehicle approaches two men standing on a grassy field. One man, who has light skin, short brown hair, and some facial scruff, wears a white short-sleeved t-shirt and holds a professional video camera with both hands. Standing beside him is another light-skinned man with short dark hair, wearing a dark t-shirt and a baseball cap, who holds a long boom pole with a large, furry microphone at the end. A large crowd of spectators is visible in the background behind white and red barriers.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video, shot from a first-person perspective, shows a motorcyclist riding. At the bottom of the frame, part of the rider’s hands gripping the handlebars is visible, with many spectators surrounding the area. As the motorcycle moves forward, it gradually approaches two people—one holding a camera and the other a boom microphone. They appear increasingly larger in the frame until about half of their bodies are visible in the lower right corner.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively establishes the first-person perspective and identifies the main subjects, but it could be more specific and dynamic. The term \"vehicle\" is too generic; given the handlebars and \"Red Bull\" helmet, it's almost certainly a dirt bike or ATV, and describing visible parts like a muddy front fender or a numbered plate would add crucial detail. The description of the rider is incomplete, as the sleeves of their racing jersey would be prominent in the shot and could be described by color, pattern, or other sponsor logos. Furthermore, the description of the two men as simply \"standing\" is passive. The video likely shows them actively engaged in their roles: the cameraman with the camera raised to his shoulder, actively filming, and the sound operator pointing the boom microphone directly at the approaching rider to capture audio. Describing these actions would better convey the purpose of the interaction. Finally, referring to the men by their roles (e.g., \"the cameraman\" and \"the sound operator\") after their initial introduction would be clearer than using \"One man\" and \"another... man.\"",
