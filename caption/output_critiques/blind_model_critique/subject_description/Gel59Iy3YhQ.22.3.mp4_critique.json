    "pre_caption": "This video is a full shot of a screen displaying a recording of a woman in a medium shot. The woman has long, dark hair with bangs and is wearing a blue jacket over a dark top. She is sitting at a table, facing forward, with a white disposable cup in front of her. The recording has a distinct green tint and visible scan lines, characteristic of an older video format. White text is overlaid in the upper right corner of the screen, showing \"MT-ROOM 3,\" an ID number, a timestamp, and the date \"18/06/94.\" Yellow subtitles appear at the bottom of the screen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This might be a full shot of a screen, suggested by the reflection in the top-right corner. The video playing on the screen appears to be a medium shot of a woman.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions:\n\n### Evaluation\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a screen displaying a recording. It accurately describes the woman's appearance (long, dark hair with bangs, blue jacket, dark top), her posture (sitting, facing forward), and the objects near her (white disposable cup). It also correctly identifies the visual artifacts of the recording (green tint, scan lines) and the specific content of the overlaid text (\"MT-ROOM 3,\" the date \"18/06/94,\" timestamp) and the presence of yellow subtitles.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete and captures all the salient visual information. It successfully describes the nested nature of the scene (a recording on a screen) and includes details about the recording's format, the subject within the recording, and the textual overlays. No significant visual element is omitted.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres exceptionally well to the given instructions.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of detail in a compact, easy-to-read paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered on the subjects (screen, recording, woman, text) and their visual attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"long,\" \"dark,\" \"blue,\" \"green\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details for the woman (hairstyle, clothing), the recording (color tint, scan lines), and the text (content, color, location).\n*   **Logical Structure:** The caption is structured logically, starting with the overall scene (a full shot of a screen) and then describing the contents of that screen in a clear, hierarchical manner.\n*   **Formatting:** It is presented as a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as instructed.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and written in a clear, objective style that perfectly fulfills the requirements of the task. It successfully translates the visual information into a concise and comprehensive text description.",
