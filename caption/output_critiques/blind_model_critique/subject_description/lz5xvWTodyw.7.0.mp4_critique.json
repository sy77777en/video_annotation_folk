    "pre_caption": "This is an industrial corridor scenery shot depicting a long, straight hallway receding into a hazy, dark distance. The environment is bathed in an eerie, dim green light emanating from fixtures mounted above a series of identical white doors that line the cinder block walls. The light casts reflections on the dark, smooth floor, where yellow safety markings are visible, and industrial equipment, including pallet jacks and stacked boxes, are scattered in the shadows along the sides. There is no main subject in the video; the focus is instead on the oppressive atmosphere and the vast, repetitive nature of the corridor. The long perspective and shadowy recesses create a sense of suspense and isolation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as an industrial corridor and notes the general layout, it misses several key visual details and mischaracterizes the lighting. The description fails to mention the slow, continuous forward dolly shot that moves the viewer down the hallway, which is the primary action in the video. The \"dim white light\" is more accurately a harsh, flickering fluorescent light with a distinct greenish hue, casting long, sharp-edged shadows that shift as the camera advances. The caption also omits specific features on the walls, such as the red fire extinguisher mounted in a recessed alcove and the exposed silver metal conduit running along the ceiling for the entire length of the hall. Furthermore, the \"stacked boxes\" are specifically brown cardboard boxes of uniform size, bound with blue plastic straps and stacked neatly on a wooden pallet, not just scattered randomly. Finally, the \"yellow safety markings\" are not just present but form a clearly defined walkway, with diagonal yellow and black stripes marking a hazard area around a large, stationary piece of machinery partially obscured in the shadows on the right.",
