    "pre_caption": "The video shows a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, which appears to be made of soft fabric and is laid flat. The underwear then transitions into a rolled-up form, with the blue waistband now forming a visible stripe along the length of the roll. The transition between the two subjects occurs as the underwear is manipulated from its original flat shape into a compact, cylindrical roll, highlighting the change in form and orientation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that demonstrates a strong understanding and adherence to the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and follows the specified formatting and stylistic rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness\n*   **Accurate Subject Identification:** The caption correctly identifies the subject as \"a pair of gray and white underwear.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It accurately describes the key visual attributes: \"gray and white,\" \"blue waistband,\" and \"soft fabric.\"\n*   **Complete Description of States:** The caption effectively describes the subject in its two distinct states: \"laid flat\" and then as a \"rolled-up form.\" It adds specific details for the second state, such as the waistband forming a \"visible stripe along the length of the roll.\"\n*   **Describes the Transition:** It successfully explains the transformation from one state to the next (\"the underwear is manipulated from its original flat shape into a compact, cylindrical roll\"), which is the core action of the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that provides all essential information without unnecessary words.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or referring to specific moments in time (e.g., \"at the beginning\").\n*   **Objective Language:** The caption uses simple, natural English and avoids subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"nice\"). The phrase \"appears to be made of soft fabric\" is an acceptable inference based on visual texture, not an unsupported opinion.\n*   **Focus on Salient Subject:** The entire description is focused on the underwear, which is the only salient subject. It does not mention the background.\n*   **Handling of \"Switching\" Subjects:** The caption perfectly follows the instruction for describing a subject that changes or \"switches.\" It treats the flat and rolled states as two distinct forms of the subject and explains the transition between them in detail, as requested.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, exactly as instructed.\n\n### Minor Point for Consideration\nWhile the caption is excellent, the phrase \"The transition between the two subjects occurs as...\" is a very literal interpretation of the instructions. It could be slightly rephrased for a more natural flow, for example: \"The underwear is then manipulated and rolled...\" However, the current wording is not incorrect and directly addresses the instruction to \"explain how the subjects change,\" making it a valid and effective choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is of high quality. It is a model example of how to follow a complex set of instructions to produce a clear, accurate, and detailed description of a video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a pair of gray and white underwear with a blue waistband, seemingly crafted from soft fabric, laid flat. The underwear is then manipulated and rolled into a compact, cylindrical form, with the blue waistband creating a visible stripe along the roll's length. This transformation highlights the change in form and orientation from its original flat shape to the rolled-up state.",
