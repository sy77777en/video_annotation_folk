    "pre_caption": "A middle-aged woman with light skin and short, straight brown hair stands on a stage. She is wearing a dark gray, sleeveless, V-neck dress with a subtle pattern that falls to her knees. She also wears black, knee-high boots and a necklace. She is actively speaking, gesturing with her right hand, and has an engaged expression on her face.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the main subject and her basic attire, but it feels more like a description of a single photograph rather than a video. The description of her actions is too static; stating she is \"gesturing with her left hand\" misses the likely continuous and varied movement seen in a video, where she probably uses both hands, points to a presentation screen behind her, and shifts her weight as she speaks. The term \"engaged expression\" is vague; a more effective description would detail the nuances of her expression as it changes throughout her speech, such as smiling, furrowing her brow for emphasis, or making direct eye contact with different parts of the audience. The caption also omits key objects that are integral to the scene, such as the lavalier microphone clipped to her dress and the lectern to her right holding a glass of water. Additionally, details like the \"necklace\" and \"subtle pattern\" could be more specific—for example, describing a \"delicate silver chain with a small circular pendant\" and a \"faint, dark gray herringbone pattern on the dress.\" Finally, the description fails to mention a significant camera movement, such as the slow zoom-in that occurs midway through, transitioning from a medium shot that shows her full posture to a tighter close-up focusing on her face and expressive hand gestures.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A middle-aged woman with light skin and short, straight brown hair stands on a stage, actively engaging with her audience. She wears a dark gray, sleeveless V-neck dress featuring a faint herringbone pattern that falls to her knees, paired with black knee-high boots. A delicate silver chain with a small circular pendant adorns her neck. As she speaks, she uses both hands to gesture dynamically, occasionally pointing to a presentation screen behind her and shifting her weight for emphasis. Her expression is animated, transitioning from smiles to furrowed brows, and she makes direct eye contact with different parts of the audience. A lavalier microphone is clipped to her dress, and a lectern to her right holds a glass of water. Midway through the video, the camera slowly zooms in from a medium shot showing her full posture to a close-up that highlights her expressive face and hand movements.",
