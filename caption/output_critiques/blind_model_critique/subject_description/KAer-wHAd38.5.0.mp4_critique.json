The focus is on the environment and the sense of open space, emphasizing the peacefulness and scale of the rural setting rather than highlighting any specific object or individual, which is why there is no main subject in the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for this video because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the scene as a rural landscape featuring a curving country road, greenery, houses with red roofs, and a partly cloudy sky. It is also accurate in stating that there is no single main subject.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is mostly complete for a scenery shot. It covers the primary elements of the landscape (road, vegetation, structures, sky) and provides some descriptive attributes for each, such as the road's curve, the houses' red roofs, and the clouds' appearance.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption fails to follow the instructions in two significant ways:\n\n1.  **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** The instructions are very clear on this point. The caption uses the words \"quiet,\" \"tranquil,\" and \"peacefulness.\" These are subjective terms that describe a mood or atmosphere, which is an interpretation of the scene rather than a direct visual observation. A better caption would stick to objective descriptors like \"sunlit\" or \"expansive,\" which are already used, and avoid words that impute a feeling onto the scene.\n\n2.  **Violation of Conciseness for Scenery Shots:** The instructions for scenery shots state to \"concisely specify the type of scenery shot\" and \"briefly explain why there is no main subject... using one to three sentences.\" While the caption uses three sentences, the explanation is verbose and repetitive. The final sentence, \"The focus is on the environment and the sense of open space, emphasizing the peacefulness and scale of the rural setting rather than highlighting any specific object or individual, which is why there is no main subject in the video,\" could be much more concise. It repeats the idea of focusing on the environment and scale multiple times.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately describes the scene, its use of subjective, emotional language and its lack of conciseness are direct violations of the provided instructions, making it a poor caption for this video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a rural landscape with a sunlit country road curving through lush greenery under a vast, partly cloudy sky. Scattered houses with red roofs are visible, and the expansive blue sky dominates the scene. The focus is on the environment and open space, explaining the absence of a main subject.",
