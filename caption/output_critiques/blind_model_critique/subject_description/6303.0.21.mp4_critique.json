    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with medium skin tone and curly black hair, wearing an orange textured outfit. He faces the camera, performing a rap while moving backward as the camera advances. In the foreground, a pair of hands is visible; the left hand holds a white comb, and the right hand holds pink-handled scissors. The man appears animated and expressive, engaging directly with the viewer.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video is shot from a first-person, high-angle view, showing a pair of hands and a man. The left hand holds a comb, and the right hand holds scissors. The man, dressed in an orange outfit, faces the camera and performs a rap, backing away as the camera moves forward.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central subject and the key foreground elements, it could be improved by providing more specific, integrated details to create a clearer picture of the action. The description of the hands is a good start, but it's unclear if they belong to a man or a woman, and more importantly, what they are doing. If they are actively cutting or styling the man's hair as he raps, this crucial interaction is missing. The caption presents the rapping and the presence of barber tools as two separate facts rather than a single, cohesive event. Furthermore, the \"orange textured outfit\" could be more descriptive—is it a knit sweater, a patterned shirt, or a tracksuit? The phrase \"animated and expressive\" is subjective; it would be more effective to describe his specific actions, such as gesturing with his hands, smiling, or raising his eyebrows, to convey this expressiveness objectively. Finally, the description of the man \"moving backward as the camera advances\" is good, but fails to mention if he is seated in a barber's chair that is being moved or if he is standing, which would significantly change the context of the scene. Integrating these details would better capture the unique and dynamic nature of the video.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a man with medium skin tone and curly black hair, dressed in a vibrant orange knit sweater. He is seated in a barber's chair, moving backward as the camera advances, creating a dynamic scene. As he performs an energetic rap, he gestures animatedly with his hands, occasionally smiling and raising his eyebrows to engage the viewer. In the foreground, a pair of hands—belonging to a woman—actively style his hair, with the left hand using a white comb and the right hand skillfully snipping with pink-handled scissors. This interaction between the rapper and the barber tools creates a cohesive and lively atmosphere.",
