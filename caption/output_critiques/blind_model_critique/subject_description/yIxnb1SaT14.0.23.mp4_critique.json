    "pre_caption": "This video is an architectural scenery shot, showcasing a grand, white, multi-domed basilica at night, viewed from a low angle looking up a wide stone staircase. The basilica is brilliantly illuminated, standing out against a dark, cloudy sky, with trees framing the scene on either side of the stairs. While numerous indistinct human figures are present on the staircase and in front of the building, they are small in scale, serving to emphasize the structure's immensity rather than acting as a central subject. The focus is thus on the majestic architecture and the nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the environment and scale over any specific entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong overview but misses several key visual nuances that define the video's atmosphere. While the basilica is described as \"white,\" the illumination actually casts a warm, golden glow on the facade, highlighting the texture of the stone and creating a more inviting, less stark appearance. The description of \"indistinct human figures\" is not entirely accurate; in the foreground, a couple is clearly visible posing for a photograph near the bottom of the stairs—the man is wearing a dark peacoat and the woman has on a long, light-tan trench coat. Their relative clarity and stillness contrast with the more blurred motion of other people walking up and down the steps, adding a layer of human narrative. Furthermore, the caption omits that the camera is not static; it performs a slow, continuous zoom-out throughout the clip, which is what increasingly emphasizes the structure's immensity by gradually incorporating more of the surrounding trees and the expansive sky. Lastly, the \"dark, cloudy sky\" is more dynamic than described, as the clouds are visibly drifting past the domes, and the sky itself is not black but a deep, hazy purple from ambient city light, which softens the contrast with the brightly lit building.",
