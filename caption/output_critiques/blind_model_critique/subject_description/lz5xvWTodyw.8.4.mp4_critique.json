    "pre_caption": "A video game's pixelated desktop interface is shown, featuring a surreal, dark background with a large building and floating watermelons. An installation window for \"HYPNOS INSTALLER\" shows a blue progress bar completing the installation of \"Professor Helper.\" After the installation is complete, a pixelated character, an elderly man with glasses, a bald head with white side hair, and a brown suit with a red bowtie, appears on the right side of the screen. A dialogue box pops up next to him, asking if the user needs help. In the bottom left corner, a light-skinned human hand holds up a paper cutout of a simple, hand-drawn cartoon character.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong, sequential overview of the events, but it could be more visually specific and explicit in its connections. While the description of the professor character is detailed, the link between him and the \"Professor Helper\" installation is only implied; it would be clearer to state that the installed program *is* the character that appears. The description of the hand-drawn character on the popsicle stick as \"simple\" is too vague; imagining the video, this character likely has specific features, such as being a crudely drawn smiley face or a stick figure with a hat, which should be mentioned. Furthermore, the caption misses an opportunity to describe the transitions between windows, which are key actions on a desktop interface. For instance, it's unclear if the \"HYPNOS INSTALLER\" window closes before the \"BLOOD MONEY\" book cover appears or if the new window overlaps it. The dialogue from the professor could also be quoted directly (e.g., \"'Need some help?'\") for greater accuracy. Finally, the description of the book cover could be enhanced with more detail, such as the color of the piggy bank or the texture of the overflowing black liquid, which likely appears as a viscous, pixelated ooze in the video.",
