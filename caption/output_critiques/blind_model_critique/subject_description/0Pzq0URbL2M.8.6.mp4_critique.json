    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by correctly identifying the main subject and its lighting conditions, but it could be more specific and confident in its descriptions. While acknowledging ambiguity is sometimes necessary, stating the object resembles \"a piece of rock or thick, folded fabric\" is slightly indecisive; it would be stronger to commit to the more likely identification based on visual cues, such as describing it as a \"geological specimen\" or a \"meteorite fragment\" if its density and sharp-edged texture suggest a mineral composition. The description of the object as \"dark\" could be enhanced with more specific color language, such as \"charcoal gray with matte black shadows.\" Furthermore, the caption misses finer textural details that might be visible, like subtle crystalline glints on the highlighted ridges or the specific nature of the \"crumpled\" surface—for instance, whether it consists of sharp, brittle-looking fractures or soft, leathery folds. The phrase \"possibly a box\" introduces unnecessary uncertainty; if the enclosure has clear features of a crate, it should be identified as such (e.g., \"a slatted wooden crate\"). Finally, the description lacks a sense of scale, which could be conveyed by relating the object's size to the visible slats of the enclosure, for example, by noting that the object is approximately a foot wide. Incorporating these specific details would create a more vivid and precise description that aligns better with the goal of providing a clear and informative visual summary.",
