    "pre_caption": "From a first-person point of view, a person with light-skinned, bare feet is seen walking forward. They are wearing loose-fitting, blue pants that cover their legs down to the ankles. The person is walking on a brown, textured carpet in a dimly lit environment, with a warm light source casting a large, dark shadow of their legs and body onto the floor in front of them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that effectively and accurately describes the video while adhering closely to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the visible elements: a person from a first-person perspective, their light-skinned bare feet, the loose-fitting blue pants, the action of walking, the brown textured carpet, the dim lighting, and the prominent shadow. There are no factual errors.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It captures the most essential details needed to understand the video's content without over-describing or speculating. It wisely avoids guessing the person's gender or age, as these are not visible. Including the detail about the large shadow is crucial, as it's a dominant visual feature of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear picture of the video in just a few sentences.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The primary focus is on the person and their attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Simple and Natural English:** The language is clear, direct, and easy to understand.\n*   **Single Paragraph:** The format is correct.\n*   **No Subjective Adjectives:** It uses objective descriptors like \"loose-fitting,\" \"blue,\" and \"dimly lit\" rather than emotional or opinion-based words.\n*   **Background Mention:** The instruction states not to mention the background unless necessary. In this case, mentioning the \"brown, textured carpet\" is necessary to describe the surface the person is walking on, and mentioning the \"dimly lit environment\" and \"warm light source\" is essential to explain the presence of the \"large, dark shadow,\" which is a key subject-related element. This is a justified and well-executed use of environmental detail.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions, balancing the need for conciseness with the inclusion of essential, descriptive detail. The decision to include background elements to contextualize the subject and the prominent shadow was the correct one, making the description more comprehensive and useful.",
