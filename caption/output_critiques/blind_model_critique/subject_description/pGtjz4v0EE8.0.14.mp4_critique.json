    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot of the bustling St. Mark's Square in Venice under a partly cloudy blue sky. The grand St. Mark's Basilica, an exemplary piece of Italo-Byzantine architecture, fills the background with its intricate facade, featuring multiple golden-topped domes, elaborate spires, and shimmering mosaics above its arched entrances. To the right, the towering, solid brick structure of St. Mark's Campanile rises high into the frame. The expansive paved square in the foreground is alive with the movement of numerous tourists strolling about, their long shadows stretching across the ground in the bright sunlight. There is no single main subject, as the camera's wide, static perspective is intended to capture the overall atmosphere, architectural grandeur, and vibrant energy of this iconic public space, making the environment itself the focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary location as St. Mark's Square and accurately describes the Basilica and Campanile, it omits several key visual elements present in the video. The \"extreme wide\" shot also clearly shows the long, arcaded Procuratie buildings that frame the left side and foreground of the square, which are not mentioned. Furthermore, the description of the people as \"numerous tourists strolling about\" is too generic; the video shows distinct groups of people, with many clustered around the base of the Campanile, others taking photos with their phones, and some sitting at the outdoor cafes that line the edges of the square under large white umbrellas. The caption also fails to mention the flocks of pigeons scattered across the pavement, a prominent feature of the scene. The phrase \"dynamic perspective\" is vague; the video actually employs a slow, continuous pan from left to right, which is a crucial detail about the shot's composition. Finally, the description uses subjective terms like \"grand,\" \"exemplary,\" and \"vibrant energy,\" which should be replaced with more objective descriptions of the architecture and the observable activities to better align with the instructions.",
