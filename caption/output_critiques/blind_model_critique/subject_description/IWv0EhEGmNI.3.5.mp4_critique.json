    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good, but with one notable deviation from the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the provided rules:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies all the key visual elements:\n*   The **first-person perspective** and the **green-tinted night vision** effect.\n*   The primary subject as a **modern assault rifle** with a **holographic sight** in the foreground.\n*   The other subjects as **several human figures** in **combat-style clothing**.\n*   The state and location of the figures as **lying motionless on the dirt ground**.\n*   It accurately transcribes the on-screen text: **\"Price: You're clear.\"**\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It captures the most salient information needed to understand the scene. It describes the main subject (the rifle), the secondary subjects (the figures), their state, and their general appearance, providing a clear and comprehensive mental image of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows most of the instructions very well, but it deviates on one key point.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet packed with essential details.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly identifies and describes the \"assault rifle\" and \"human figures\" with their key visual attributes.\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** It describes what is visible (\"motionless,\" \"combat-style clothing\") without inferring emotions or making assumptions.\n*   **Structure and Language:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English, and it avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes the foreground subject (the rifle) from the subjects in the distance (the figures) and describes them in a logical order of prominence.\n\n**Where it deviates:**\n*   **Describing On-Screen Text:** The main deviation is the inclusion of the subtitle, `\"Price: You're clear.\"`. The instructions are heavily focused on describing **physical subjects and their visual attributes** (e.g., a person's clothing, an object's shape). While on-screen text is a visual element, it is not a physical subject in the same way a person or a rifle is. The instructions ask to \"focus on subject types and visual attributes,\" and describing text falls outside this core directive. It adds narrative context rather than describing a physical object's appearance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent in its description of the visual subjects and the scene's composition. It is accurate, complete, and follows most of the complex rules. Its only significant departure from the instructions is the decision to include the on-screen text, which, while informative, is not a description of a physical subject as defined by the guidelines.",
