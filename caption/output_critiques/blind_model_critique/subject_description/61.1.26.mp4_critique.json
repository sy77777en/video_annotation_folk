    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman with wavy, shoulder-length hair and a light skin tone. She is wearing red-tinted glasses and a dark-colored jacket with a green trim. Her expression is cheerful, and she is holding a small glass near her face, suggesting she might be in a social setting. The lighting casts a warm glow, highlighting her features and creating a lively atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**1. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** The instruction explicitly forbids using subjective, emotional adjectives. The caption violates this rule by describing the woman's expression as \"**cheerful**\" and the atmosphere as \"**lively**.\" A more compliant description would focus on objective facial features, such as \"smiling with her mouth slightly open.\"\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about\":** The instruction requires describing only what is visually present. The caption speculates with the phrase \"**suggesting she might be in a social setting**.\" This is an inference about the context, not a description of a visible subject.\n*   **Violation of \"Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary\":** The caption describes the \"**lively atmosphere**,\" which is an interpretation of the background/environment and is not a physical subject. While mentioning the \"warm glow\" of the lighting is borderline, its primary purpose here is to set a mood (\"lively atmosphere\"), which is not the goal of the description.\n\n**2. Accuracy:**\n\n*   The caption mixes objective descriptions (e.g., \"wavy, shoulder-length hair,\" \"red-tinted glasses\") with subjective interpretations (\"cheerful,\" \"lively\"). This makes the overall description less accurate and reliable, as it blends verifiable facts with the writer's personal feelings and assumptions.\n\n**3. Completeness:**\n\n*   The description is reasonably detailed regarding the woman's upper body and face. However, by focusing on subjective elements like atmosphere and potential context, it misses the opportunity to provide more objective visual details that might be present, such as the material of the jacket, the specific style of the glasses, or a more precise description of her pose.\n\nIn summary, the caption fails because it includes emotional interpretations, speculates about the context, and describes the non-essential atmosphere, all of which are explicitly forbidden by the instructions. A good caption would have focused strictly on observable, objective details.",
