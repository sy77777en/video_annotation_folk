The focus is not on a singular subject but rather on the dynamic and atmospheric display of natural forces, highlighting the raw power and texture of the sea. From an overhead perspective, foamy white water surges and breaks over the irregular, partially submerged rock, contrasting with the surrounding blue-green hues of the turbulent ocean, creating a scene of constant motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as an overhead shot of ocean waves crashing on a rock, it misses several key visual details and includes subjective language. The description of the rock as \"dark, moss-covered\" is a good start, but in the video, the moss is a vibrant, almost fluorescent green, concentrated in the crevices and contrasting sharply with the wet, black volcanic rock. The caption also fails to mention the clusters of small, grey barnacles encrusting the upper portions of the rock, which are clearly visible as the water recedes. The phrase \"raw power\" is an interpretation rather than a visual description; a more objective alternative would be to describe how the impact of the waves sends white spray several feet into the air. Furthermore, the caption omits the quality of the light; the video is clearly filmed on a bright, sunny day, causing a brilliant, shimmering reflection on the surface of the blue-green water and making the white foam appear intensely bright. Finally, the sentence explaining the focus of the shot is redundant; a stronger caption would simply describe the constant motion of the foamy white water surging, breaking, and then pulling back, revealing the rock's textured surface before the next wave arrives.",
