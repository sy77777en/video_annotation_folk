    "pre_caption": "The video features an animated blue-gray anthropomorphic cat with large pink inner ears, a white muzzle, and a light blue belly. The cat’s head is atypically replaced by a shiny metal electric iron, with the iron’s cord hanging down and the iron’s faceplate oriented forward, obscuring the cat’s facial features. The cat’s whiskers protrude from the sides of the iron, and the cat’s body is upright and facing forward. The cat’s appearance is distinctly cartoonish, with exaggerated proportions and smooth, simplified textures, and the iron is rendered with realistic metallic reflections and details, creating a striking contrast between the animated body and the realistic object replacing its head.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the instructions with a high degree of accuracy and detail. However, there is one minor violation regarding subjective language.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Evaluation\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is extremely accurate and vivid. It paints a clear and unambiguous picture of a surreal, hybrid subject. The details provided (blue-gray fur, pink ears, white muzzle, iron head, hanging cord) are specific and create a strong mental image.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the subject type (\"anthropomorphic cat\"), describes its key visual attributes (color, texture, body parts), notes its unusual state (head replaced by an iron), and includes its pose (\"upright and facing forward\"). It also astutely observes the different rendering styles of the body and the head, which is a crucial visual detail.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Concise & Informative:** **Excellent.** The paragraph is dense with information without being overly long.\n*   **Subject Focus:** **Excellent.** The description is entirely focused on the single subject, ignoring any potential background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** **Excellent.** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"picture.\"\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** **Excellent.** The language is clear, professional, and easy to understand.\n*   **Precise Subject Type:** **Excellent.** \"Animated blue-gray anthropomorphic cat\" is a perfect, precise description.\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** **Excellent.** The description of the cat's body, the iron head, the whiskers, and the contrasting textures (\"cartoonish\" vs. \"realistic metallic reflections\") is superb.\n*   **Format:** **Excellent.** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Area for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Avoid Subjective Adjectives:** The caption violates this rule with the word **\"striking.\"** The phrase \"...creating a **striking** contrast...\" describes the *effect* on the viewer rather than an objective quality of the subject itself. While the contrast is an objective fact, calling it \"striking\" is a subjective judgment. The word **\"atypically\"** is borderline but more defensible, as it factually describes that a cat's head is not typically an iron. However, the instruction is to avoid any subjective language, and a more neutral phrasing is possible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **very good** and follows almost all instructions perfectly. Its only flaw is the use of the subjective adjective \"striking.\" By removing that single word, the caption would be in perfect compliance with the instructions.\n\n**To make it perfect, the final sentence could be rephrased:**\n\n\"The cat’s appearance is cartoonish, with exaggerated proportions and smooth textures, while the iron is rendered with realistic metallic reflections and details. This creates a contrast between the animated body and the object replacing its head.\"",
