    "pre_caption": "A female video game character with a slender build wears a red and black top, dark pants, and a red headpiece over her dark hair. A long, thin weapon is visible on her back. From the knees down, her legs have an atypical appearance, glowing with a light blue light and appearing to be made of a crystalline substance. Also present is a tall, slender, beige-colored pillar with horizontal brown bands and carved details. A large, floating, fiery structure, resembling an inverted mountain made of orange and yellow crystal, hangs in the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"female video game character,\" which is a more precise and contextually appropriate term than simply \"woman.\" The descriptions of her clothing (red and black top, dark pants, red headpiece), weapon, and unique crystalline, glowing blue legs are all factually correct. The descriptions of the secondary subjects—the \"beige-colored pillar\" and the \"large, floating, fiery structure\"—are also precise and true to their visual appearance.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, capturing all the salient subjects and their most important visual attributes. It describes the character in the most detail, as she is the primary focus, and then provides sufficient detail for the pillar and the floating structure to be clearly visualized. It does not omit any key visual information.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule outlined in the instructions:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of information in a single, well-structured paragraph without being overly long.\n*   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** The entire description is focused on the subjects and their visual characteristics.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames or using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective adjectives. The use of \"atypical\" is a factual observation of the character's unusual legs, not an emotional judgment. Phrases like \"appearing to be\" and \"resembling\" are used effectively to describe ambiguous features without making unverified claims.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses clear and specific terms like \"female video game character,\" \"pillar,\" and \"structure.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details for each subject, such as color, shape, material, and distinguishing features (e.g., \"glowing with a light blue light,\" \"carved details,\" \"resembling an inverted mountain\").\n*   **Logical Prioritization:** It correctly prioritizes the subjects, starting with the most prominent one (the character) before moving to the other significant elements in the scene.",
