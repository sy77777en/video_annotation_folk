    "pre_caption": "A female video game character with a slender build wears a red and black top, dark pants, and a red headpiece over her dark hair. A long, thin weapon is visible on her back. From the knees down, her legs have an atypical appearance, glowing with a light blue light and appearing to be made of a crystalline substance. Also present is a tall, slender, beige-colored pillar with horizontal brown bands and carved details. A large, floating, fiery structure, resembling an inverted mountain made of orange and yellow crystal, hangs in the sky.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their core visual traits, it lacks the dynamic detail expected from a video description, presenting the scene as a static image rather than a moving sequence. For instance, it fails to mention the character's actions; in the video, she is not just standing but slowly turning, allowing the light to catch the intricate silver embroidery on her black top, and she briefly rests her hand on the hilt of the weapon on her back, which is clearly a long, single-edged sword resembling a katana. The description of her legs as simply \"glowing\" is an understatement; the video shows the light blue energy within the crystalline limbs pulsing rhythmically and leaving faint, dissipating light trails as she shifts her weight. Furthermore, the \"carved details\" on the beige pillar are not random but are clearly depicted as glowing blue runes that match the light from the character's legs, suggesting a connection that the caption misses. Finally, the \"fiery structure\" is more active than described, with molten orange streams flowing down its crystalline facets and small, glowing embers drifting down through the air, which adds significant atmospheric motion to the scene that is entirely absent from the current text.",
