    "pre_caption": "The video features a sports car with a striking red, blue, and white color scheme. The front of the car displays large numbers, \"+30°\" and \"30°,\" prominently on the hood. The car's sleek design includes aerodynamic curves and a visible logo on the front. In the latter part of the video, the car is seen from the rear, showcasing its dynamic shape and dual exhausts. The car is in motion, with snow being kicked up around it, indicating it is driving on a snowy surface. The overall design and markings suggest a high-performance vehicle, possibly used for racing or testing in cold conditions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary subject as a multi-colored sports car and its action of driving in snow, it lacks the specificity and objective detail required by the instructions. The term \"sports car\" is too general; based on the livery and snowy conditions, a more precise term like \"rally car\" would be appropriate, and if the model is recognizable (e.g., an Audi Quattro or Lancia Stratos), it should be named. The description of \"a visible logo\" is vague and should be detailed (e.g., \"the four-ringed Audi logo\" or \"a Martini racing stripe\"). The caption also omits other significant visual attributes I observed, such as a large rear spoiler, a roll cage visible through the windows, and specialized, deep-tread snow tires on multi-spoke wheels. A crucial secondary subject, the driver wearing a white helmet and a blue racing suit, is completely ignored. Furthermore, the caption uses subjective adjectives like \"striking,\" \"sleek,\" and \"dynamic,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptors like \"angular,\" \"wide-bodied,\" or \"low-profile.\" Finally, instead of segmenting the description into \"front\" and \"latter part,\" a more cohesive paragraph would integrate these views, for example, by describing the car's overall form and then mentioning the rear view in the context of the massive plume of snow being thrown from its rear wheels.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a rally car with a distinctive red, blue, and white livery, prominently featuring the numbers \"+30°\" and \"30°\" on its hood. The car, possibly an Audi Quattro, is equipped with a large rear spoiler, a roll cage visible through the windows, and specialized deep-tread snow tires on multi-spoke wheels. The four-ringed Audi logo is clearly displayed on the front. The driver, wearing a white helmet and a blue racing suit, navigates the car across a snowy surface, kicking up a massive plume of snow from the rear wheels. The car's angular, wide-bodied design and low-profile stance emphasize its high-performance capabilities, suitable for racing or testing in cold conditions.",
