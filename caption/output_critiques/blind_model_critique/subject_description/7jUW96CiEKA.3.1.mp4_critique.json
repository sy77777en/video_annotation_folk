    "pre_caption": "The video features a hippopotamus partially submerged in water. The hippo's head and back are visible above the surface, displaying a smooth, dark brown skin. Its eyes and ears are prominent, positioned high on the head, which is typical for a hippo, allowing it to remain mostly underwater while still observing its surroundings. The water around the hippo is calm, reflecting the animal's stillness. The hippo's body is oriented horizontally, suggesting it is either resting or slowly moving through the water.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few key areas where it fails to adhere strictly to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be accurate. It describes a scene that is common for a hippopotamus—being partially submerged in water. The physical descriptions, such as the high placement of eyes and ears and the appearance of the skin, are consistent with the known attributes of a hippo.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the main subject, its position, and its key visible attributes (head, back, skin, eyes, ears, orientation). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is where the caption has some issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Clear:** It is a single, coherent paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Precise Subject Type:** It correctly uses the precise term \"hippopotamus.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It effectively describes the hippo's \"smooth, dark brown skin,\" \"prominent\" eyes and ears, and \"horizontal\" orientation.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **No Subjective Adjectives:** The adjectives used (\"smooth,\" \"dark brown,\" \"prominent,\" \"calm\") are descriptive rather than emotional.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n*   **Describing What Is Not Visible/Making Inferences:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption violates this rule with the clause: \"...which is typical for a hippo, **allowing it to remain mostly underwater while still observing its surroundings.**\" This explains the biological *function* of the hippo's anatomy, which is external knowledge and not a direct visual observation from the video itself.\n*   **Describing the Background Unnecessarily:** The instruction says to \"avoid mentioning the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The caption states, \"The water around the hippo is calm, **reflecting the animal's stillness.**\" While the calmness of the water is a visual fact, the phrase \"reflecting the animal's stillness\" is an interpretation of the relationship between the background and the subject, which is not strictly necessary. A more compliant description would be simply \"The hippo is in calm water.\"\n*   **Slightly Meta Introduction:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\" While not explicitly forbidden, the instructions emphasize a direct description. A more direct and effective opening would be \"A hippopotamus is partially submerged in water...\" which immediately focuses on the subject itself.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good in its descriptive quality and clarity. However, to be perfect according to the provided rules, it should be revised to remove the explanatory biological information and the interpretive phrase about the water reflecting the animal's state. It should stick strictly to what is visually present.",
