    "pre_caption": "A large, dark, reddish-brown silhouette of a fantastical creature is centrally located. The creature's lower half is a thick, twisting, trunk-like form, from which white, root-like appendages sprout. Its upper torso has a humanoid shape but features six long, thin, spider-like arms, three on each side, ending in sharp points. Perched atop this creature's head or shoulders is the smaller, lighter-colored silhouette of a person with white hair, who is looking upwards. A stream of small, white, bubble-like particles rises from the smaller figure's head.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **excellent**. It successfully adheres to all the specified rules and provides a high-quality description.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptive language. It uses precise and objective terms to describe the visual elements. For example, instead of just saying the creature has legs and arms, it specifies a \"thick, twisting, trunk-like form\" and \"six long, thin, spider-like arms.\" It also accurately notes the uncertainty of the smaller figure's exact position by stating \"perched atop this creature's head or shoulders.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, capturing all the essential subjects and their key attributes. It describes the main creature (size, color, form, appendages, arms) and the secondary figure (size, color, hair, pose) as well as the dynamic element of the \"rising... particles.\" It paints a full and detailed picture of the scene without adding speculative information.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph that conveys a large amount of visual information without unnecessary words.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The entire description is centered on the two subjects, their appearances, and their spatial relationship, correctly avoiding discussion of the background.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives (e.g., \"scary,\" \"beautiful\") and instead uses descriptive ones (\"large,\" \"dark,\" \"reddish-brown,\" \"humanoid\").\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"fantastical creature\" (a well-reasoned judgment call for an ambiguous being) and a \"person.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on color, shape, texture (\"root-like\"), and pose (\"looking upwards\").\n*   **Logical Structure:** It correctly prioritizes the \"large, dark... centrally located\" creature as the main subject before describing the smaller person, which is a logical order based on visual prominence.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** The caption successfully avoids forbidden words like \"image\" and \"frame.\" It mentions the \"rising\" particles, which is a necessary description of an action, as permitted by the instructions.",
