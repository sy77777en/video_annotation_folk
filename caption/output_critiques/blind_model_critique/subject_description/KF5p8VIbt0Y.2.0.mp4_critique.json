    "pre_caption": "The video features several people in what appears to be a crowded 1920s-era establishment. Initially, the focus is on a man and a woman sitting at a small, round table. The man has dark hair, a mustache, and wears a light-colored military uniform with a kepi-style hat. The woman across from him has dark, short, curly hair, a dark cloche hat, and a dark dress with a prominent white lace collar and a long necklace. They are holding hands. The scene then moves to a second couple at another table, where a man in a military uniform argues with a woman in a dark dress and cloche hat, who then splashes a drink at him. Finally, the view settles on a larger group at a table, centering on a man with dark hair in a military-style jacket. He is surrounded by other men and women, including a woman with light-colored hair and a pearl necklace to his left. The scene ends with the central man holding up a coupe-style glass as a pair of hands in white shirt cuffs pours a beverage from a bottle into it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video is a continuous dolly shot that begins with a medium shot of a man and woman sitting across from each other at a dining table. The camera moves forward, passing between them to reveal a medium shot of another man and a woman in an argument, and the woman splashes a glass of wine at the man. The camera then passes through this second couple and shows a full shot of seven people at another table, with more people in the background. The camera keeps moving forward until it reaches a medium shot of a man in the center, holding a wine glass in front of him. Behind him, the bartender is pouring wine into the glass, with only the bartender's hands visible in the frame.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres exceptionally well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's content. It correctly identifies the subjects (men, women), their attire (military uniforms, cloche hats, lace collars), key objects (round table, coupe-style glass), and the specific actions that occur (holding hands, splashing a drink, pouring a beverage). The inference of a \"1920s-era establishment\" is a reasonable and well-supported contextual detail based on the visual evidence.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, capturing the narrative flow of the video. It successfully breaks down the content into three distinct scenes, describing the primary subjects and their interactions in each one. It starts with the first couple, moves to the second couple's argument, and concludes with the larger group and the final action of pouring the drink. This level of detail provides a full and clear understanding of the video's progression.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption meticulously follows the given rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of visual information without being overly wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the people and their attributes, as instructed.\n*   **Holistic Narrative:** It combines details from across the video into a single, coherent paragraph without referencing specific \"frames\" or \"images.\"\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** The caption sticks to what is visible. For instance, it describes \"a pair of hands in white shirt cuffs\" pouring the drink, correctly avoiding any assumption about who those hands belong to. The use of \"appears to be\" is an appropriate hedge for contextual information.\n*   **Simple and Natural Language:** The description is written in clear, easy-to-understand English.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives, focusing purely on descriptive facts.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details about clothing, hairstyles, accessories, and actions, which helps in visualizing the scene.\n*   **Distinguishes Subjects Clearly:** It effectively differentiates between multiple subjects using their relationships (\"the woman across from him\"), appearance (\"woman with light-colored hair\"), and actions (\"man in a military uniform argues with a woman\").\n*   **Describes Transitions:** It explicitly notes the transitions between scenes (\"The scene then moves to...\", \"Finally, the view settles on...\"), which is crucial for understanding the video's structure.\n*   **Correct Formatting:** The output is a single, unformatted paragraph, exactly as requested.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a lively scene in a bustling 1920s-era venue. It opens with a man and a woman seated at a small, round table, holding hands. The man, sporting dark hair and a mustache, is dressed in a light-colored military uniform with a kepi-style hat, while the woman opposite him has dark, short, curly hair, a dark cloche hat, and a dark dress featuring a prominent white lace collar and a long necklace. The focus then shifts to another couple at a nearby table, where a man in a military uniform is engaged in a heated argument with a woman in a dark dress and cloche hat, who retaliates by splashing a drink at him. The scene culminates with a larger group gathered around a table, highlighting a man with dark hair in a military-style jacket. He is flanked by several men and women, including a woman with light-colored hair and a pearl necklace to his left. The video concludes with the central man raising a coupe-style glass as a pair of hands in white shirt cuffs pours a beverage from a bottle into it.",
