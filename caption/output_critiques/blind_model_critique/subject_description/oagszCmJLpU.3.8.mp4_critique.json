    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dramatic landscape scenery shot, capturing the immense power of a developing supercell storm over a flat, open plain. The sky is dominated by a colossal, swirling mass of dark grey and black clouds that churn and expand, with a small patch of blue sky visible to the left. Along the horizon, a warm, golden light illuminates the scene, contrasting sharply with the ominous clouds above, and bright shafts of what appears to be rain or sunlight break through the storm's base. There is no main subject in the traditional sense; the focus is entirely on the vast, atmospheric spectacle, emphasizing the scale and raw beauty of the natural environment over any single object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption effectively captures the overall mood and correctly identifies the scene as a landscape focused on a storm, but it misses several key dynamic elements that are central to the video's impact. It fails to mention that this is a time-lapse, which is crucial for understanding how the clouds \"churn and expand\" so rapidly. The description of the supercell itself could also be more specific; in the video, a distinct, rotating wall cloud is visible at the base of the storm, a defining and menacing feature that the caption overlooks. Furthermore, a major dramatic component is entirely absent from the description: the frequent, brilliant flashes of intracloud lightning that illuminate the dark cloud mass from within, truly emphasizing the storm's \"immense power.\" Lastly, while the \"bright shafts\" are mentioned, the video clearly shows this is a dense, localized rain shaft falling onto the plain, not ambiguous sunlight, and adding a detail like the lone, unpaved road stretching toward the horizon would provide a stronger sense of scale than the generic \"flat, open plain.\"",
