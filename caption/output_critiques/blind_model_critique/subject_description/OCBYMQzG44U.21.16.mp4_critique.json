    "pre_caption": "This video presents an architectural scenery shot of a sterile, minimalist interior. A wide, curving staircase, covered entirely in small white tiles, descends into a circular space defined by large, plain white pillars and a matching tiled wall. A simple metal handrail follows the curve of the stairs, which lead down towards a dark, teal-colored void or pool of water. The scene is bathed in a diffuse, slightly greenish light, creating a clean yet unsettling atmosphere. The video lacks a traditional main subject, as the focus is placed entirely on the liminal and surreal quality of the architecture itself, emphasizing the environment's scale and mood over any specific object or character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual content. It correctly identifies the key architectural elements: a \"wide, curving staircase, covered entirely in small white tiles,\" \"large, plain white pillars,\" a \"matching tiled wall,\" and a \"simple metal handrail.\" The description of the area at the bottom as a \"dark, teal-colored void or pool of water\" is also accurate, as it acknowledges the ambiguity of that space. The lighting is correctly described as \"diffuse\" and \"slightly greenish.\"\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully identifies the video as a scenery shot and provides a comprehensive description of the environment. It adheres to the specific instruction for scenery shots by explaining *why* there is no main subject, stating that the focus is on the architecture, scale, and mood. It covers all the prominent visual features of the scene without leaving out any important details.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption follows most instructions well, but it fails on two key points.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly provides a concise, one-paragraph description.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the video type as a \"scenery shot\" and explains the lack of a main subject, as required.\n    *   It uses precise terms for the subjects (\"staircase,\" \"pillars,\" \"handrail\").\n    *   It describes the visual attributes (color, material, shape) of the architectural elements in detail.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Violation of Objectivity:** The most significant failure is the violation of the rule: \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several subjective and interpretive words, such as **\"sterile,\" \"unsettling,\" \"liminal,\"** and **\"surreal.\"** These words describe a feeling or atmosphere rather than objective visual facts.\n    *   **Use of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"This video presents...,\" which is a form of introductory text. The instruction states to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The description should begin directly with the subject matter.",
