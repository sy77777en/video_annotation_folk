    "pre_caption": "A close-up view shows the rear windshield of a dark green car. The tinted glass has several white vinyl stickers applied to its upper right side, including logos for \"GReddy,\" \"LTD,\" \"Haltech,\" \"neutrale,\" \"TOYO TIRES,\" and \"Renown.\" A smaller, more intricate white sticker is visible in the lower right corner. A reflection of the car's light green interior, possibly a panel or a roll cage, is cast across the windshield, along with a mirrored reflection of some of the stickers. The scene is lit by bright sunlight, which creates a strong glare in the upper portion of the glass.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres almost perfectly to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is extremely accurate. It correctly identifies:\n*   The subject as a \"close-up view\" of a \"rear windshield of a dark green car.\"\n*   The specific brand names on the white vinyl stickers: \"GReddy,\" \"LTD,\" \"Haltech,\" \"neutrale,\" \"TOYO TIRES,\" and \"Renown.\"\n*   The presence of a second, \"smaller, more intricate white sticker\" in the lower right corner.\n*   The \"reflection of the car's light green interior\" and the \"mirrored reflection of some of the stickers.\"\n*   The lighting conditions, noting the \"bright sunlight\" and the resulting \"strong glare.\"\n\nEvery detail mentioned in the caption is visually present in the video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the salient visual information in a single, coherent paragraph. It describes the main subject (the windshield), its key features (tint, stickers), the reflections on its surface, and the lighting that affects its appearance. It provides enough detail for a reader to form a precise mental image of the scene without being overly verbose.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of and adherence to the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, well-written paragraph that is dense with factual information.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the car's windshield and its attributes, correctly avoiding any mention of the out-of-focus background.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"rear windshield,\" \"dark green car,\" and \"white vinyl stickers.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It excels at describing attributes, including color (\"dark green,\" \"white,\" \"light green\"), material (\"tinted glass,\" \"vinyl\"), and specific text on the stickers.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **No Subjective Language:** It uses descriptive adjectives (\"strong glare,\" \"intricate sticker\") that describe visual qualities rather than conveying emotion.\n*   **Single Paragraph Format:** It is correctly formatted as a single paragraph with no introductory text.\n\n**Minor Point for Improvement:**\n\nThe only minor deviation from the instructions is the phrase \"**possibly a panel or a roll cage**.\" The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" While this is an educated guess based on the shape of the reflection, it is still a form of speculation. A stricter adherence would be to describe only what is visible, for example: \"A reflection of a light green, cage-like structure from the car's interior is cast across the windshield.\"\n\nHowever, this is a very minor point in an otherwise outstanding caption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is of very high quality. It is accurate, comprehensive, and follows the complex set of instructions with precision. The feedback is a small refinement to achieve perfect adherence, but as it stands, the caption is excellent.",
