    "pre_caption": "A large Komodo dragon with brownish-gray, beaded skin and a powerful, muscular body walks across the scene. It has a long, thick tail, sturdy legs with dark, clawed feet, and an elongated head. The lizard initially approaches a large, brown, rectangular cardboard box standing upright, flicking its long, forked tongue out to investigate it before continuing on its path.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview, but it misses several key visual details that would make the description more vivid and accurate. While it mentions the Komodo dragon \"walks across the scene,\" it fails to describe the creature's distinctive, lumbering gait; its body sways heavily from side to side with each step, and its thick tail sweeps across the dusty ground behind it, leaving a faint trail. The description of the skin as \"brownish-gray\" is correct, but it omits the noticeable yellowish-ochre coloring on the loose skin around its neck and jowls. The term \"powerful\" is subjective; a more objective description would be to note its low-slung, heavy-set frame. Furthermore, the interaction with the box is simplified. After flicking its tongue, the dragon actually nudges the cardboard box with its snout, causing the upright box to wobble precariously before settling. The box itself isn't just brown; it has a partially torn top flap and a faded, black shipping label visible on the side facing the camera. Finally, the conclusion is imprecise; the dragon doesn't just continue on its path but makes a slow turn away from the box, giving a full profile view before it ambles out of the frame to the left.",
