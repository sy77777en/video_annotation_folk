    "pre_caption": "This is a scenery shot of a dimly lit, futuristic industrial interior. The room is constructed from gray, metallic panels, with a large, rounded window on the left emitting an ominous red glow. In the background, a bright blue holographic console casts a stark light on a workstation, contrasting with the surrounding gloom. The video lacks a central subject, as the camera's slow pan is designed to establish the environment's tense and mysterious atmosphere. The focus is on the interplay of light and shadow, the functional yet worn state of the room, and the sense of place rather than on any specific character or object. Details like a flashing red light on a wall panel, a fire extinguisher, and scattered debris on the floor contribute to the scene's lived-in, slightly distressed feel.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies this as a scenery shot of a futuristic interior, it heavily relies on subjective and interpretive language such as \"ominous,\" \"stark,\" \"tense,\" and \"mysterious,\" which violates the instruction to avoid adjectives that convey emotion. The description should state that a red light emanates from the window, not that the glow is \"ominous.\" Furthermore, the caption over-explains the filmmaker's intent by stating the shot is \"designed to establish\" an atmosphere, rather than simply describing the visual elements. The description of \"scattered debris\" is too vague; a better caption would have specified the visible objects, such as the \"crumpled data sheets and a discarded metallic canister\" I saw on the floor. The caption also misses key details that were visible in the slow pan, like the \"exposed, sparking wires hanging from a ceiling panel\" and the \"flickering, geometric patterns\" displayed on the blue holographic console. A more effective description would remove the analysis and focus on a purely objective inventory of the scene, detailing the specific objects and light sources without assigning emotional weight to them.",
