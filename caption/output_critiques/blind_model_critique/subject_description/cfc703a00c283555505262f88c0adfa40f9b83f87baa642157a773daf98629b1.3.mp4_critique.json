    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **partially good** but contains significant flaws that violate several key rules.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and correctly describes plausible components of such a scene: a river, rocky banks, green vegetation, hills, mountains, and a sky with clouds. It correctly follows the specific instruction for describing a scenery shot by focusing on the overall environment rather than a non-existent main subject.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in the sense that it addresses the special case for scenery shots outlined in the instructions. It specifies the type of scenery, describes its key elements, and provides an explanation for the absence of a main subject.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails in several important ways:\n\n1.  **Violation of Objectivity:** The instructions explicitly state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption violates this rule multiple times with words like:\n    *   \"**tranquility**\"\n    *   \"**beauty**\"\n    *   \"**serene**\"\n    *   \"**unspoiled**\"\n    These words describe feelings, interpretations, and judgments rather than objective visual facts.\n\n2.  **Violation of Conciseness:** The instructions ask for a \"**concise** yet informative description.\" The final two sentences are redundant and overly wordy.\n    *   *Sentence 2:* \"The focus is on the expansive natural environment, emphasizing the scale and tranquility of the river and its surroundings rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.\"\n    *   *Sentence 3:* \"There is no main subject because the intent is to capture the atmosphere and beauty of the landscape as a whole, inviting viewers to appreciate the serene and unspoiled character of the scene.\"\n    These two sentences say almost the same thing. The explanation for why there is no main subject could have been combined into a single, more direct sentence.\n\n3.  **Describing the Unseen (Intent):** The instructions state, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" The caption describes the creator's \"**intent**\" and what the video is \"**inviting viewers to appreciate**.\" This is an interpretation of purpose, not a description of visual content, and should be avoided.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the caption correctly identifies the video type and follows the structural rule for scenery shots, it fails on the critical instructions regarding objectivity, conciseness, and avoiding interpretation. A better caption would describe the scene factually and explain the lack of a main subject in a more direct and objective manner.\n\n**A better, compliant version would look like this:**\n\nThis is a landscape scenery shot of a wide, gently flowing river between rocky banks with green vegetation. In the distance are hills and mountains under a blue sky with large white clouds. The video does not have a main subject, as the composition focuses on the expansive natural environment and the scale of the landscape.",
