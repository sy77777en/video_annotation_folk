    "pre_caption": "This video presents a dynamic aerial cityscape scenery shot, captured from the perspective of a fast-moving drone. The camera swoops and glides over a dense, sprawling city built on a mountainside, characterized by its ubiquitous red-orange terracotta-tiled roofs and white-walled buildings. The exhilarating flight path navigates through narrow gaps and over rooftops, eventually revealing a historic-looking white church with a brick bell tower perched on a higher elevation. There is no single main subject, as the rapid, immersive camera movement is designed to showcase the overall scale, atmosphere, and unique architectural texture of the city itself, rather than isolating a specific focal point.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is good but not perfect, as it violates a few key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the rules:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the content as a \"dynamic aerial cityscape scenery shot\" from a \"fast-moving drone.\" The description of the city—\"dense, sprawling,\" \"built on a mountainside,\" with \"red-orange terracotta-tiled roofs and white-walled buildings\"—is precise. The mention of a \"white church with a brick bell tower\" is also an accurate detail.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It successfully captures the essence of the video by focusing not just on the static elements but also on the camera's movement (\"swoops and glides,\" \"navigates through narrow gaps\"). It correctly identifies that there is no single main subject and provides a complete rationale for why the focus is on the overall environment, which is a crucial aspect of this type of video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has some flaws.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots. It identifies the type (\"cityscape scenery shot\") and correctly explains why there is no main subject (\"the rapid, immersive camera movement is designed to showcase the overall scale, atmosphere, and unique architectural texture of the city\").\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the video as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Forbidden Words:** It correctly avoids using \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Subject Attributes:** It provides good visual details for the buildings and the church (colors, materials, architectural style).\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**What it does wrong (Violations):**\n*   **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule by using the word **\"exhilarating.\"** The word **\"immersive\"** is also subjective and should be avoided.\n*   **Introductory Text:** The instruction states, \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption begins with **\"This video presents...,\"** which is a forbidden introductory phrase. The description should start directly, for example: \"A dynamic aerial cityscape scenery shot is captured from...\"\n*   **Conciseness:** While the description of the motion is important, phrases like \"exhilarating flight path\" are more stylistic than purely descriptive and contribute to a lack of conciseness.\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent in its understanding and description of the video's content but fails on the critical rules of avoiding subjective emotional language and introductory phrases.",
