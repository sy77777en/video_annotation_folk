    "pre_caption": "A digital map display features a dark, textured background overlaid with a white grid. A large, irregular area is outlined by a glowing, dashed red line. Within this boundary, a solid, glowing red line traces a path, starting horizontally, making a U-turn, and then proceeding in a parallel line to create a back-and-forth search pattern. This path is associated with a small, white, conical icon. White text boxes on the screen display changing latitude and longitude coordinates. In the bottom-left corner, a white circular icon contains a compass-like symbol.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Completeness:** The caption provides a highly accurate and complete description of what is happening. It correctly identifies all the key subjects (\"digital map display,\" \"white grid,\" \"red line,\" \"conical icon,\" \"text boxes,\" \"circular icon\") and their specific visual attributes (color, texture, shape, glowing effect, dashed vs. solid lines). It also accurately describes the dynamic action of the path being traced in a \"back-and-forth search pattern\" and the \"changing latitude and longitude coordinates,\" which are the most important events in the video.\n\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is packed with information but remains a single, clear, and easy-to-read paragraph.\n    *   **Focus on Subjects and Attributes:** The entire caption is dedicated to describing the subjects and their visual characteristics, as instructed.\n    *   **Holistic Description:** It successfully synthesizes the action over time into a coherent narrative without referring to specific frames (e.g., \"traces a path\" instead of \"in the first frame the line is short, and in the last it is long\").\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n    *   **Objective Language:** The caption uses descriptive, neutral adjectives (\"dark,\" \"glowing,\" \"irregular,\" \"conical\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n\n*   **Adherence to Specific Rules:**\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms for each element on the screen, avoiding vague words.\n    *   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the different subjects (e.g., \"glowing, dashed red line\" vs. \"solid, glowing red line\") and presents them in a logical order, starting with the overall display and then focusing on the primary action and supporting elements.\n    *   **Describing Motion:** The mention of the path being traced and the coordinates changing is essential for describing the subject's action and the video's purpose, fully justifying its inclusion as per the instructions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is precise, objective, and comprehensive, providing a clear mental picture of the video's content while strictly adhering to every constraint.",
