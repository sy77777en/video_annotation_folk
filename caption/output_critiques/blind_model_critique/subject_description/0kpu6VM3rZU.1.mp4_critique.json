    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but contains a few key errors that violate the instructions. It successfully describes the main subjects with good detail but fails in its analysis of the background and its concluding sentence.\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe description of the two primary subjects is accurate. It correctly identifies a woman in a gold dress holding a trophy and another woman in a light-colored dress holding a microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" The visual attributes like hair color/style and clothing are described correctly.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is very complete in its description of the two main subjects. It provides sufficient detail about their appearance, the objects they are holding, and their interaction, which allows a reader to form a clear mental picture.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThis is where the caption has some significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the key subjects and their attributes.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly identifies the main and secondary subjects (\"woman\").\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Clear Differentiation:** It successfully distinguishes between the two women using their clothing, hair, and actions.\n*   **Prioritization:** It correctly starts with the main subject before moving to the secondary one.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n1.  **Making Inferences:** The phrase \"**suggesting a red carpet event**\" is an interpretation of the scene, not a direct description of what is visible. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\" While the formal attire might lead to this conclusion, the caption should only state the observable fact (e.g., \"people dressed in formal attire\") and omit the speculation about the event type.\n2.  **Using Meta-Commentary:** The final sentence, \"**The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element**,\" is an analysis of the video's composition, not a description of the subjects themselves. The instructions require a direct description, and the focus should be made apparent *through* the detailed description of the subjects, not by explicitly stating it.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is mostly good, with strong, accurate descriptions of the primary subjects. However, it violates the rules by including an inference about the event type and by adding a concluding sentence that analyzes the video's focus instead of simply describing its contents. To be fully compliant, it should remove the speculative phrase \"suggesting a red carpet event\" and the entire final sentence.",
