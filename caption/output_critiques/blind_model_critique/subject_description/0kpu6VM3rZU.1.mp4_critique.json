    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman as the main subject, wearing a shiny, metallic gold dress with thin straps. She has long, straight black hair and is holding a trophy in her right hand. Her expression is animated, and she appears to be speaking into a microphone held by another woman. The secondary subject, a woman with long brown hair in an updo, is wearing a light-colored, embellished dress and is holding the microphone labeled \"ET Canada.\" In the background, several people are visible, dressed in formal attire, suggesting a red carpet event. The main focus is on the interaction between the two women, with the trophy being a notable element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview, but it lacks the specific visual details that would be present in the video. The description of the trophy as just \"a trophy\" is too generic; in the video, it's clearly a golden statuette of a winged figure on a black base, which is a crucial detail. The main subject's \"animated expression\" could be more precisely described as her smiling widely and laughing as she speaks. Furthermore, the caption misses key attributes of her attire; the \"shiny, metallic gold dress\" is a floor-length, sequined gown with a plunging V-neck, and she is also wearing large diamond stud earrings that catch the light. The description of the interviewer is adequate, but the interaction could be more dynamic; she isn't just holding the microphone, she is actively angling it towards the first woman's mouth while nodding attentively. Lastly, the final sentence stating the main focus is redundant and violates the \"show, don't tell\" principle; a strong description would make the focus evident without explicitly stating it. The background, while secondary, clearly features a step-and-repeat wall with repeating logos for \"The Film Awards,\" which would have been a valuable detail to confirm the event type rather than just suggesting it.",
