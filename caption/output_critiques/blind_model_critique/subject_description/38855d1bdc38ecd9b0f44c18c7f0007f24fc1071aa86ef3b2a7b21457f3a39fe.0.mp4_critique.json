    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a white robe with gold trim, wearing a white cap. He has a light skin tone and a short beard. Initially, he walks toward the camera holding a blue book, which appears to be a religious text. As he approaches, his head moves out of the frame. He then kneels in front of a wooden book stand, placing the book on it. The video transitions to a full-body view of him in a kneeling posture, focused on the book.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The clip begins with a full shot of a man in a white robe walking toward the camera. As he gets closer, his head moves out of the frame. He then kneels, and the shot transitions back to a full-body view of him in a kneeling posture.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a man and accurately describes his clothing (white robe with gold trim, white cap), physical features (light skin tone, short beard), and the objects he interacts with (a blue book, a wooden book stand). The sequence of actions—walking, his head moving out of view, kneeling, and placing the book—is also described in the correct chronological order.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses one key detail requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **What it does well:** It provides a comprehensive overview of the subject's appearance and the main actions that occur. It successfully describes the objects and their key attributes (blue book, wooden stand). It also effectively notes a change in framing (\"his head moves out of the frame\").\n*   **What is missing:** The instructions state, \"When shot transitions occur, describe the subject in each segment separately, noting the type of transition (e.g., hard cut, soft transition).\" The caption mentions, \"The video transitions to a full-body view,\" but it fails to specify the *type* of transition, which is a specific requirement.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions but fails on a few points.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The description is a clear, single paragraph that focuses on the subject and his actions.\n    *   **Precise Language:** It uses specific terms like \"man,\" \"robe,\" \"cap,\" and \"book stand\" instead of vague words.\n    *   **Objective Description:** It avoids subjective adjectives and handles uncertainty well (\"appears to be a religious text\").\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids using \"image\" or referring to specific frame numbers.\n    *   **Logical Order:** It describes the events in the order they happen, which is appropriate for this video.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Shot Transition:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption does not describe the type of shot transition (e.g., hard cut), which is a direct violation of the instructions.\n    *   **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\". While not explicitly forbidden, the instructions emphasize \"simple, natural English.\" A more direct opening, such as \"A man in a white robe...\" would be more in line with the spirit of the instructions, which aim for a description of the content itself rather than a description of the video as a container.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It is accurate and follows most of the stylistic and content guidelines. However, its failure to specify the type of shot transition is a significant deviation from the instructions, and its opening phrase could be more direct.",
