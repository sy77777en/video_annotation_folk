    "pre_caption": "This video presents a breathtaking maritime scenery shot captured from the bow of a massive container ship on the open ocean at night. Above, a spectacular, star-studded sky, featuring the dense band of the Milky Way, is partially obscured by low, dark clouds. A distant thunderstorm flashes intermittently, illuminating the cloud formations from within and casting a faint glow on the horizon. The shot lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural environment. The focus is on the awe-inspiring juxtaposition of the serene, star-filled cosmos and the dynamic, stormy weather over the vast, dark sea. The ship itself serves primarily as a vantage point, with the tops of its containers in the foreground guiding the viewer's gaze into the epic scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a maritime scenery shot from a container ship at night, it deviates from the instructions by including subjective, emotional language and interpretive analysis rather than a purely objective description. The use of words like \"breathtaking,\" \"spectacular,\" and \"awe-inspiring\" violates the rule to avoid subjective adjectives. Furthermore, sentences explaining the shot's purpose, such as \"The shot lacks a single main subject, instead emphasizing the immense scale\" and \"The ship itself serves primarily as a vantage point,\" are meta-commentaries on the composition, which should be avoided. The description could be improved by adding more specific visual details that I observed. For instance, the caption mentions \"tops of its containers,\" but it could specify that these are dark, rectangular silhouettes forming a geometric pattern in the lower third of the view. The description of the ocean as just a \"vast, dark sea\" is too general; it fails to mention the subtle texture of rolling swells and the brief, silvery reflections on the water's surface during the lightning flashes. The \"distant thunderstorm\" could be more precisely described as silent sheet lightning that causes the entire cloud mass on the horizon to pulse with a soft, white light, revealing its complex, layered structure for a moment before darkness returns. A more effective caption would remove the interpretive language and instead focus on these concrete, observable details to convey the scene's scale and atmosphere objectively.",
