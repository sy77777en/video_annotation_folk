She is looking forward with a neutral expression. In front of her is a plate of food, and a glass with a lemon slice is visible. To her right, partially visible, is another person wearing a yellow garment. The setting suggests a dining environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the provided instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes specific, verifiable details such as the subject being a \"woman,\" the colors of her clothing (\"white shirt,\" \"maroon vest\"), the name on her name tag (\"Annie\"), and the presence of a \"lemon slice\" in the glass. It avoids making unconfirmed assumptions.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is comprehensive, capturing all the salient subjects and their key attributes. It details the main subject's appearance, pose, and expression, describes the objects directly related to her, and includes the partially visible secondary subject. It provides a full and clear picture of the scene's focus.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption successfully balances conciseness with detail. It is a single, fluent paragraph that is easy to read while being packed with information.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the subjects (\"woman,\" \"person,\" \"plate,\" \"glass\") and their visual attributes, as instructed.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objectivity:** The caption is objective and avoids subjective or emotional language. The use of \"neutral expression\" is a perfect example of this.\n*   **Precise Identification and Detail:** It uses precise terms (\"woman,\" \"person\") and provides excellent descriptive detail (e.g., \"white shirt under a maroon vest,\" \"hair is tied back,\" \"glass with a lemon slice\").\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** The caption follows the instructions for multiple subjects perfectly. It identifies the \"woman\" as the main subject, describes her in detail, and then briefly describes the secondary \"person,\" distinguishing them by location (\"To her right\") and appearance (\"wearing a yellow garment\").\n*   **Avoiding Speculation:** The caption excels at describing only what is visible. It correctly omits details that might be ambiguous, such as the woman's age or ethnicity, and wisely refers to the second individual as a \"person\" since other details might not be clear.\n*   **Background and Context:** The final sentence, \"The setting suggests a dining environment,\" is a minor deviation from the rule to avoid describing the background. However, it is a reasonable and helpful inference that provides essential context without being overly descriptive. The use of the word \"suggests\" shows appropriate caution and improves the overall coherence of the description. In this case, it's a good judgment call that enhances the caption.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is of high quality and demonstrates a strong understanding of all instructions. It is accurate, complete, objective, and well-structured. The minor inclusion of a contextual sentence about the setting is a well-judged decision that improves the description's clarity.",
