    "pre_caption": "A herd of approximately a dozen horses runs together.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects as a herd of running horses and notes the general color variations, it lacks the specific detail needed to paint a full picture of the scene. The description of their posture as simply \"running\" is generic; if the video shows a clear gait, using a more precise term like \"galloping\" or \"cantering\" would be more informative. The caption could be significantly improved by including more distinct visual attributes beyond just coat color. For instance, the video might show specific markings, such as a pinto horse with large patches, a horse with a white blaze on its face, or another with white socks, which are key identifiers missed in the current description. Furthermore, the caption treats the herd as a uniform group, but the video could reveal a clear social structure or formation, such as a prominent grey horse leading the pack or a smaller foal running close to its mother. Mentioning these relationships and age or size variations would add crucial context. Finally, describing their physical condition, such as having sleek, muscular builds or long, flowing manes and tails, would provide a much richer and more accurate depiction of the subjects.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A herd of approximately a dozen horses gallops together, showcasing a stunning array of coat colors, from light tan and chestnut to dark brown, with a striking grey horse leading the pack. Among them, a pinto horse with large patches and another with a distinctive white blaze on its face stand out, while a smaller foal runs closely beside its mother. The horses exhibit sleek, muscular builds, with long, flowing manes and tails, moving as a cohesive group that highlights their social structure and dynamic energy.",
