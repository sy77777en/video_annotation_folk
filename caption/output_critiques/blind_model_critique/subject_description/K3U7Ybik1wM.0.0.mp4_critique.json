    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, a pair of light-skinned, bare feet are visible at the end of a bed, propped up on a white duvet. The person's legs are covered by dark blue sweatpants. The view looks past the feet towards an ornate, black metal footboard with brass-colored finials. Above, a vaulted ceiling with exposed wooden beams features two large, bright skylights. On the wooden posts flanking the bed, wall sconces emit a warm, orange light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately establishes the first-person perspective and identifies the main structural elements of the room, it misses the dynamic quality of the video and several key contextual objects. The description portrays a static scene, whereas in the video, the person's bare feet are not just propped up but are seen subtly wiggling their toes, and the camera, representing the person's head, makes slow, slight movements as if from breathing. The caption completely omits the most significant feature visible past the footboard: a large, floor-to-ceiling window between the wooden posts that looks out onto a dense, misty pine forest, which is the true focal point beyond the feet. Furthermore, the description of the bed is incomplete; resting on the wrinkled white linen duvet, next to the person's legs, is a half-read paperback novel lying face-down and a white ceramic mug steaming with coffee, details that strongly suggest a relaxed morning. The caption also misses the atmospheric effect of the bright morning light streaming through the skylights, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, which contrasts with the artificial warmth of the still-lit sconces. Finally, while the sweatpants are dark blue, the video shows they are made of a soft, heathered material, a textural detail that adds to the cozy feeling of the scene.",
