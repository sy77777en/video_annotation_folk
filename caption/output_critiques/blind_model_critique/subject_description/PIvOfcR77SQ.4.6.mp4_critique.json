  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is accurate in identifying the video as a landscape scenery shot. It correctly describes the primary visual elements as a \"snowy landscape\" and a \"vast sky,\" which accurately reflects the content of a video focused on a wide, natural environment.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is complete according to the specific instructions for a scenery shot. It successfully explains *why* there is no main subject by stating that the focus is on the \"expansive environment,\" \"atmosphere,\" and \"scale,\" rather than a particular object. This fulfills the requirement to justify the scenery shot classification.\n\n**Adherence to the given instruction:**\nThe caption adheres to most of the instructions well, but it fails on one critical point.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly follows the format of a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the video type as a \"landscape scenery shot\" and explains the lack of a salient subject, as instructed.\n    *   The language is generally simple and clear.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The caption violates the rule: **\"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"** The phrase \"creating a sense of openness and tranquility\" is subjective. \"Tranquility\" describes a feeling or mood, which is an emotional interpretation of the scene. \"Openness\" also leans towards a subjective feeling rather than a purely objective visual description. A better approach would be to stick to describing the physical attributes, such as \"an unobstructed view of the horizon.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a landscape scenery shot, focusing on the expansive environment with a vast sky and snowy landscape. The emphasis is on the physical attributes of the scene, highlighting the unobstructed view of the horizon and the scale of the natural surroundings, rather than any specific object.",
