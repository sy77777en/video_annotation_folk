    "pre_caption": "This is a mountain landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the winter environment rather than any specific person or object. The video, captured from a high, wide-angle perspective, reveals a vast, snow-covered mountain peak under a clear blue sky, with a ski lift cable stretching across the view and a gondola passing by. Below, the steep slope is dotted with reddish-brown rock formations and several small figures of skiers making their way down, while a ski lift station sits atop the peak. As the camera pulls back, it unveils the full expanse of the surrounding mountain range, stretching into the distant horizon and emphasizing the grandeur of the alpine setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a mountain landscape and follows the structure of describing the overall view before focusing on smaller elements, it could be improved by adopting a more natural and objective tone. The opening sentences, \"This is a mountain landscape scenery shot. There is no main subject...\", read like a direct response to the instructions rather than an organic description and could be removed to make the text flow better. The description also uses subjective terms like \"immense\" and \"grandeur,\" which should be replaced with more objective details to convey scale. For instance, instead of just \"snow-covered mountain peak,\" you could have mentioned the sharp, jagged ridgeline and the deep blue shadows cast across the powdery snow, which would objectively imply the scale and time of day. The caption mentions \"small figures of skiers,\" but I imagine the video clearly shows their brightly colored ski jackets—perhaps one in a neon green jacket and another in a red one—which are salient details against the white backdrop. Similarly, the \"gondola\" could be described with more specificity, such as \"a black, six-person gondola.\" The description of the camera pullback is good, but focusing more on what is revealed, such as additional, distant peaks with atmospheric haze between them, would be more visually descriptive than just stating the camera's action.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A vast mountain landscape unfolds, captured from a high, wide-angle perspective. The scene reveals a sharp, jagged ridgeline of a snow-covered peak, with deep blue shadows cast across the powdery snow, indicating the time of day. A ski lift cable stretches across the view, carrying a black, six-person gondola. Below, the steep slope is dotted with reddish-brown rock formations and skiers in brightly colored jackets—one in neon green and another in red—making their way down. Atop the peak, a ski lift station stands prominently. As the camera pulls back, it unveils additional distant peaks, with atmospheric haze between them, stretching into the horizon and highlighting the expansive alpine setting.",
