    "pre_caption": "The video features five individuals dressed in identical white outfits with orange stripes, including hoods that cover their heads. One person stands out by wearing a tall, red top hat. They are all gathered closely around a small, black rectangular screen mounted on a white structure. The individuals are leaning in and appear to be focused on the screen, with one person pointing towards it. Their body language suggests curiosity or examination. The scene is minimalistic, with the subjects being the primary focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few clear violations of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the rules:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate. It provides specific, verifiable details about the subjects and objects (five individuals, identical white and orange outfits, one red top hat, a small black screen). The description is consistent and paints a clear, believable picture of the video's content.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is mostly complete. It successfully identifies all the main subjects, describes their key visual attributes and clothing, and notes their collective action and focus. It also describes the primary object of their attention.\n\nHowever, it may be incomplete in one area:\n*   **Shot Transitions:** The instructions require describing shot transitions (e.g., hard cuts) and how subjects change between segments. The caption does not mention any. If the video is a single continuous shot, the caption is complete. If it contains cuts, the caption has missed a key requirement.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows most instructions well but fails on a few important points.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the scene in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"individuals,\" \"person,\" and \"screen.\"\n*   **Visual Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on clothing (\"identical white outfits with orange stripes,\" \"tall, red top hat\") and objects (\"small, black rectangular screen\").\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It successfully distinguishes the group from the unique individual with the top hat.\n*   **Describes What's Visible:** By mentioning the hoods cover the heads, it correctly avoids speculating on unseen facial features, hair, or expressions.\n*   **Describes Poses/Actions:** It notes that the subjects are \"gathered closely,\" \"leaning in,\" and one is \"pointing.\"\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Violation of \"No Subjectivity\":** The sentence **\"Their body language suggests curiosity or examination\"** is a direct violation of the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" \"Curiosity\" and \"examination\" are interpretations of internal states, not objective descriptions of physical actions. The caption should have stuck to describing the observable actions (leaning, pointing, looking).\n*   **Unnecessary Scene Description:** The final sentence, **\"The scene is minimalistic, with the subjects being the primary focus,\"** is a meta-commentary on the video's composition. The instructions state not to mention the background unless necessary to distinguish subjects. This sentence describes the overall aesthetic rather than the subjects themselves.",
