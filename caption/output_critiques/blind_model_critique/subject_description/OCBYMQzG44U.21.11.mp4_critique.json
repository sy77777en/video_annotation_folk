    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior architectural scenery shot, looking down into a swimming pool area. The pool, filled with rippling teal water, is partially encircled by a white spiral staircase featuring a metallic railing. The surrounding walls and floor are covered in white square tiles. A small, indistinct orange object floats in the water. There is no main subject as the focus is on the clean, minimalist architectural design and the serene atmosphere of the aquatic space, rather than any particular entity.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main elements like the pool and spiral staircase, it contains subjective interpretations and lacks key visual specifics. The phrase \"adding a playful touch\" and the entire final sentence describing the \"clean, minimalist architectural design\" and \"serene atmosphere\" are subjective and should be removed, as per the instructions to avoid emotional or interpretive language. The description of the \"rubber duck\" is incomplete; it should specify its color, which is likely a vibrant yellow, to make it a distinct subject. Similarly, the \"metallic railing\" could be more precisely described as \"polished chrome\" or \"brushed steel.\" A significant omission is the lighting; the caption fails to mention the bright, natural light that likely floods the space from large, unseen windows or a skylight, causing distinct reflections on the rippling teal water and the glossy white tiles. Finally, the opening is slightly clunky; stating the camera \"pans... transitioning to focus on\" is redundant. A more integrated description would be to state that the camera movement across the tiled floor reveals the pool area, making the description of the action and the subject more seamless.",
