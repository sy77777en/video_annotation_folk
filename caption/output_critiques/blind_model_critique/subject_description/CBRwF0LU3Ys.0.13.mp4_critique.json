    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is the feedback on the caption:\n\n**Caption:** A group of small, dark figures, appearing to be people, are visible in the distance. They are positioned along the crest of a vast sand dune, appearing as silhouettes against the bright, hazy sky. Due to the significant distance and atmospheric conditions, no individual details such as clothing or specific actions can be discerned.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres exceptionally well to all the provided instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate for a video depicting distant figures on a dune. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"figures\" and qualifies this with \"appearing to be people,\" which is the appropriate level of certainty given the likely visual evidence.\n*   It accurately captures their key visual attributes: \"small,\" \"dark,\" and \"silhouettes.\"\n*   The description of their position (\"along the crest of a vast sand dune\") and the environmental context (\"against the bright, hazy sky\") is precise and necessary to understand the scene.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is both concise and complete. It provides all the essential information without unnecessary detail.\n*   It successfully describes the subjects as a group, which is the correct approach when individuals are not distinct, as per the instructions.\n*   It proactively addresses the lack of detail by explaining *why* it's missing (\"Due to the significant distance and atmospheric conditions\"), which demonstrates a thorough understanding of the \"avoid describing what you are unsure about\" rule.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** The caption is centered on the figures, treating them as the primary subjects.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** This is a key strength. The phrase \"appearing to be people\" perfectly handles ambiguity, and the final sentence explicitly states that details cannot be seen, which is a direct and effective way to avoid making things up.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, professional, and easy to understand.\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or markdown.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive adjectives (\"small,\" \"dark,\" \"vast,\" \"bright\") rather than subjective or emotional ones.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly identifies the subjects as a group of figures and explains the ambiguity regarding their type (\"people\").\n*   **Group Description:** It follows the guideline for describing multiple subjects without a clear focus by treating them as a collective \"group.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, objective, and appropriately cautious, describing only what is visible while providing necessary context for the viewer to understand the scene.",
