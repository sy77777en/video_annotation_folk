    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as an \"animated brown mouse\" and precisely describes its key features, such as its \"large pink ears,\" \"long tail,\" and \"anthropomorphic\" nature. The objects are also identified with great accuracy: a \"thin, pointed wooden stick, resembling a toothpick,\" a \"small bowl containing green olives,\" and an \"empty, clear glass coupe.\" The description of the spatial relationships (\"to the left,\" \"to its right\") is also correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete, capturing all the essential subjects and their most important visual details. It describes the mouse's pose (\"stands on its hind legs\"), what it is holding, and the state of the surrounding objects (the \"empty\" glass). The level of detail is impressive without being excessive, such as specifying the type of glass (\"coupe\") and the stick's appearance (\"resembling a toothpick\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and concise, conveying the necessary information efficiently.\n*   **Focus:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their visual attributes, correctly omitting any mention of the background or non-essential details.\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses neutral, descriptive language and avoids subjective adjectives.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"mouse,\" \"bowl,\" \"glass coupe\") as instructed.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It correctly prioritizes the central subject (the mouse) before describing the secondary objects in relation to it, creating a logical and easy-to-follow description.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"",
