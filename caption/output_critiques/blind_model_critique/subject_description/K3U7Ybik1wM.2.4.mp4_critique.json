The camera tilts up from a large, dark blue range cooker with two chrome-lidded hotplates, revealing a backsplash of wavy, white subway tiles and a stainless steel extractor hood above. The cooker is flanked by light green cabinets with curved drawer fronts and wooden countertops, with a window to the right offering a view of a green lawn. There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing the cozy and well-appointed atmosphere of the kitchen environment itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Caption Evaluation\n\nThe caption is very good but has one notable flaw regarding the instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects (range cooker, backsplash, extractor hood, cabinets, countertops) and their specific visual attributes (dark blue cooker, chrome lids, wavy white subway tiles, stainless steel hood, light green cabinets, wooden countertops). The description of the camera's upward tilting motion is also an accurate representation of how the scene is revealed.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It captures the essential elements of the kitchen in a logical order that follows the camera's movement. It starts with the most prominent object at the beginning of the shot (the cooker) and moves upward to include the backsplash, hood, and surrounding cabinetry, effectively summarizing the entire video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is clear, natural, and informative without being overly wordy.\n    *   **Holistic Description:** It successfully combines details into a unified description of the scene without referring to specific \"frames.\"\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"range cooker,\" \"cabinets,\" and \"extractor hood\" and distinguishes them clearly.\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It perfectly follows the specific instruction for scenery shots by identifying the video type (\"interior scenery shot\") and explaining the lack of a main subject in the final sentence.\n    *   **Motion:** It correctly includes the camera's \"tilts up\" motion, as this action is necessary to explain how the subjects are revealed sequentially.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The main area where the caption fails to adhere to the instructions is the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses \"rustic,\" \"country-style,\" \"cozy,\" and \"well-appointed.\"\n        *   \"**Rustic**\" and \"**country-style**\" are borderline, as they can be objective descriptors of a specific design aesthetic. However, they can also carry subjective connotations.\n        *   \"**Cozy**\" is a clear violation, as it describes a feeling or emotion associated with the atmosphere.\n        *   \"**Well-appointed**\" is also a violation, as it is a subjective value judgment about the quality and furnishing of the kitchen.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent in its structure, accuracy, and adherence to most of the complex instructions. Its only significant flaw is the inclusion of subjective and emotional adjectives (\"cozy,\" \"well-appointed\"), which the instructions explicitly forbid. To be fully compliant, these words should be removed or replaced with more objective descriptions.",

There is no main subject, as the focus is on establishing the inviting and well-equipped atmosphere of the kitchen environment itself.",
