    "pre_caption": "This video captures a static cityscape scenery shot, offering a sweeping panoramic view of Paris at night from a high vantage point. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the expansive urban environment and its nocturnal atmosphere, highlighting the scale and beauty of the city. The iconic Eiffel Tower, brilliantly illuminated in gold, dominates the right side of the frame, its powerful searchlight beam cutting through the dark, overcast sky. Further in the distance, a large Ferris wheel glows with bright white light, and the golden dome of another historic building is visible, creating a captivating tableau of famous landmarks against the night.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the primary landmarks and the overall scene as a Parisian cityscape at night, it violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives by using words like \"dynamic,\" \"sweeping,\" \"beauty,\" and \"captivating.\" The description of the city itself is too generic; based on the video, it should include more specific details, such as the network of streets forming a grid of yellow and white light, with the red and white streaks of moving vehicle traffic clearly visible below. The caption mentions a \"slow zoom-out\" but omits the simultaneous slow pan from left to right that reveals the full panorama. Furthermore, it fails to describe the inherent motion of the subjects, such as the steady, clockwise rotation of the Eiffel Tower's searchlight beam illuminating the low-hanging clouds, or the constant, slow turn of the Ferris wheel. The description of the sky as just \"overcast\" is also incomplete, as the city's glow is visibly reflecting off the underside of the clouds, creating an orange-hued ceiling above Paris. Finally, the \"historic building\" is clearly identifiable as Les Invalides, and naming it would add precision, just as mentioning the dark, unlit ribbon of the River Seine snaking through the city would provide a more complete picture.",
