    "pre_caption": "The video features a person with short, dark hair that includes a streak of lighter color. They have a fair complexion and are wearing dark eye makeup, which accentuates their eyes. The person appears to be looking directly at the camera, with a neutral expression. Their lips are slightly parted, and they are positioned closely to the camera, filling most of the view. The lighting highlights their facial features, creating a clear and focused view of their face.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Here is a detailed feedback on the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is very good and provides a high-quality description that is accurate, detailed, and mostly compliant with the instructions. However, there are a few minor areas where it could be improved for perfect adherence.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be highly accurate. It describes a single subject in a close-up shot, focusing on specific, verifiable visual details like hair color (\"short, dark hair that includes a streak of lighter color\"), makeup (\"dark eye makeup\"), and facial expression (\"neutral expression,\" \"lips are slightly parted\").\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete for what is likely a tight close-up shot. It successfully captures the most salient features of the person's face, their gaze, and their position relative to the camera. It also includes relevant details about the lighting's effect, which is a good addition.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Subject Focus:** The caption correctly focuses entirely on the subject's visual attributes as instructed.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives, using the descriptive term \"neutral expression.\"\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand while remaining highly descriptive.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames or using the forbidden words \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses the appropriate and neutral term \"person\" and distinguishes them with a wealth of specific details.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n*   **Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which functions as introductory text. The instruction explicitly states to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" A more direct and compliant opening would be to start the description immediately, for example: \"A person with short, dark hair that includes a streak of lighter color is shown...\"\n*   **Use of \"View\":** The caption uses the word \"view\" twice (\"filling most of the view,\" \"focused view\"). While not explicitly forbidden like \"image\" or \"frame,\" it serves a similar function by referring to the visual field of the recording. This could be rephrased to be more direct, for instance: \"...they are positioned closely to the camera, filling most of the composition\" and \"...creating a clear and focused composition.\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is excellent in its descriptive quality and accuracy. The suggested changes are minor but would make the caption perfectly aligned with all aspects of the detailed instructions.",
