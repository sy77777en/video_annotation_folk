    "pre_caption": "The video features a young man with short dark hair and a light skin tone. He is wearing a dark blue shirt and is captured in a close-up view, focusing on his face. His expression is neutral, with his eyes closed initially and then open, suggesting a moment of contemplation or thoughtfulness. The lighting is soft, highlighting his facial features and creating a calm atmosphere.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and the core action. However, it relies on subjective interpretations such as \"contemplation or thoughtfulness\" and a \"calm atmosphere,\" which violates the instruction to avoid describing emotions or moods. Instead of interpreting his expression, the description should focus on observable facial details, for example, \"his facial muscles remain relaxed and his mouth is closed.\" The description of his features and clothing lacks specificity. For instance, \"short dark hair\" could be improved by detailing the style (e.g., \"a fade with curly hair on top\"), and \"dark blue shirt\" could be clarified as a \"navy blue crewneck t-shirt\" or a \"collared button-down shirt.\" Furthermore, the caption could more precisely describe the action itself; for example, noting whether he opens his eyes slowly or quickly and where his gaze is directed afterward (e.g., \"he slowly opens his eyes and looks directly at the camera\"). Adding these specific, objective details would create a more accurate and informative description that adheres strictly to the provided guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a young man with a light skin tone and a hairstyle consisting of a fade with curly hair on top. He is wearing a navy blue crewneck t-shirt. The close-up view focuses on his face, where his facial muscles remain relaxed and his mouth is closed. Initially, his eyes are closed, and he then slowly opens them, directing his gaze directly at the camera. The soft lighting highlights his facial features.",
