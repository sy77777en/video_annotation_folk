    "pre_caption": "A red sedan, identifiable as a taxi by the yellow light on its roof, is shown on a wide, multi-lane bridge at night. The car is centered on the road, initially driving away from the viewer before turning around and approaching with its headlights on. The bridge is defined by two long, symmetrical rows of tall, slender streetlights, one on each side. The lights are illuminated, casting a warm glow onto the road surface and creating a visual corridor that recedes into the darkness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subject and setting, it misses several key visual details that define the scene's atmosphere and could be more precise. The description of the car as a \"red sedan\" might be an overstatement; in the dim, warm-toned lighting from the streetlights, the car's color appears more like a dark orange or maroon, and its specific body type is difficult to distinguish beyond being a standard four-door vehicle. The caption also omits the prominent reflections on the road, suggesting the asphalt is wet, which causes the headlights and the double row of streetlights to streak across the surface in long, shimmering lines. Furthermore, the scene is not entirely empty; in the far distance, the faint red taillights of other vehicles are visible, adding a sense of depth and scale to the bridge. The \"darkness\" into which the bridge recedes is not absolute; the faint, silhouetted outline of a city skyline is discernible against the night sky. Finally, the phrasing \"identifiable by the yellow car topper sign\" is slightly awkward; a more direct description like \"A car with an illuminated yellow sign on its roof\" would be more natural and concise.",
