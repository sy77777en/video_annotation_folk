    "pre_caption": "In a laundromat, a man with dark, curly hair and a light brown complexion stands holding a white laundry basket. He wears a bright red, textured, long-sleeved sweater, brown pants, and red shoes, and he looks down toward a woman. The woman, who appears to be older, is seated on a black chair. She wears a white head covering, a light green jacket over a pink shirt, light-colored pants, and reddish-brown shoes. Her hands are clasped in her lap, and a white laundry basket rests on a small bench next to her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the two subjects, their clothing, and their immediate actions in the laundromat. However, it describes the scene as a static photograph rather than a video, missing the crucial element of movement. In the video, the man actually walks into the frame from the left, carrying his basket, and stops near the woman, which suggests he might be waiting for the machine she is seated in front of. The description of his sweater as \"textured\" is accurate but could be more specific; it's a distinct cable-knit pattern. The caption also misses that the man has a light, five-o'clock shadow. For the woman, the description \"appears to be older\" could be substantiated by mentioning her short, gray hair, which is visible. Furthermore, her \"white headphones\" are specifically large, over-ear headphones, not earbuds. The \"light-colored pants\" are beige trousers, and the \"small bench\" her basket rests on is actually the built-in seating common in laundromats, attached to the chair she occupies. Most importantly, the caption omits the brief interaction at the end of the clip where the woman glances up from her phone and makes eye contact with the man for a moment before looking back down, which changes the dynamic from two separate individuals to a subtle, shared moment.",
