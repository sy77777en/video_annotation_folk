    "pre_caption": "In a dimly lit, crowded setting, two men are in close interaction. One man, maintaining a serious facial expression, wears a dark fedora, a grey suit, a white collared shirt, and a dark, solid-colored tie. The other man, who turns towards the first and places a hand on his shoulder, also wears a dark fedora and a grey suit with a white shirt; he is distinguished by glasses, a smiling expression, and a patterned tie. Several other indistinct figures, appearing to be men in hats and suits, are visible in the dark background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully identifies the main subjects and their basic actions, it could be improved by adhering more closely to the instructions. The description uses subjective terms like \"serious expression\" and \"smiling expression,\" which should be replaced with objective descriptions of facial features, such as \"a neutral expression with a set jaw\" or \"upturned lips and crinkled eyes.\" The caption also violates the rule against using the word \"frame\"; phrases like \"enters the frame\" should be reworded to something like \"appears from the right.\" Furthermore, the description lacks crucial physical details requested in the instructions, such as the men's approximate ages, skin tones, and any facial hair—for example, the man in the grey suit could be a middle-aged, light-skinned man with a square jaw, and the man with glasses could have dark, slicked-back hair. Finally, the description of the first man's movement \"behind him\" is ambiguous; it would be more precise to state if he recedes into the background crowd or simply repositions himself while remaining visible.",
