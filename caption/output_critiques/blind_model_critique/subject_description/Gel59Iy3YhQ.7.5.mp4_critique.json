    "pre_caption": "A video game character with a slender build and light-colored hair is shown on a rocky cliff face. The character is wearing white and brown clothing and has a long, staff-like object on its back. It is positioned in mid-air, as if jumping or climbing between ledges. On a separate ledge to the right, there is a small cluster of dark, round objects and a single red, mushroom-like object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a functional but overly generic description that misses key details likely visible in the video. The description of the character is vague; a video would clearly show if the character is male or female, and details like \"dark-colored hair\" could be specified as \"short, black, spiky hair.\" Similarly, \"white and brown clothing\" could be more descriptively rendered as \"a white, sleeveless tunic with brown leather straps and bracers.\" The \"staff-like object\" is also an ambiguous term for what might be a more distinct weapon, such as a \"wooden bo-staff with metallic ends\" or a \"sorcerer's staff with a glowing crystal.\" The phrase \"as if jumping or climbing\" is indecisive; the video would depict a clear action, like \"the character is frozen mid-air during a dynamic leap between two ledges,\" which conveys more energy. The \"small cluster of dark, round objects\" and \"red, mushroom-like object\" are likely specific in-game items, such as \"a cluster of glistening ore deposits\" and \"a single, bioluminescent red mushroom,\" whose unique appearances are lost in the general description. The caption also fails to establish a relationship between the character and these objects, which could be their destination or an obstacle to avoid.",
