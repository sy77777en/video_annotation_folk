    "pre_caption": "This video presents a majestic landscape scenery shot captured from a low angle within a snow-covered forest. The night sky is dominated by a spectacular display of the aurora borealis, with brilliant, swirling curtains of vibrant green light stretching across the expanse. Silhouetted against this celestial phenomenon are the dark spires of numerous evergreen trees and the bare branches of a deciduous tree, their forms adding depth and scale to the scene. The composition intentionally lacks a single main subject; instead, the focus is on the overwhelming beauty and grandeur of the natural environment, creating an atmosphere of awe and wonder.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a low-angle, snow-covered forest at night with an aurora, it relies heavily on subjective and emotional language such as \"majestic,\" \"spectacular,\" \"brilliant,\" and \"awe and wonder,\" which violates the instruction to avoid such terms. The description of the aurora could be more specific; for instance, the video might show the green light pulsating or undulating slowly, with faint streaks of violet or pink visible at the edges, details that are currently omitted. Furthermore, the caption fails to mention other key visual elements that would likely be present in such a video, such as the dense field of stars visible in the clear night sky between the bands of light. The description of the snow as simply \"snow-covered\" is too general; the video likely shows texture, such as powdery drifts piled against the tree trunks or a smooth, unbroken surface reflecting the celestial light. Finally, the caption treats the scene as static, but a video might include the subtle motion of the tree branches swaying in a light wind or could be a timelapse, causing the aurora to shift and evolve rapidly across the sky, a crucial dynamic element that is not adequately conveyed by the word \"swirling.\" The statement about the composition's intent is an analysis rather than a direct description of the visual content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a low-angle view of a snow-covered forest at night, showcasing the aurora borealis. The green light of the aurora pulsates and undulates slowly, with faint streaks of violet and pink at the edges. A dense field of stars is visible in the clear night sky between the bands of light. The snow forms powdery drifts against the tree trunks and reflects the celestial glow. Dark spires of evergreen trees and bare branches of a deciduous tree are silhouetted against the sky, adding depth to the scene. The subtle motion of tree branches swaying in a light wind and the dynamic shifts of the aurora, possibly captured in timelapse, highlight the scene's natural beauty.",
