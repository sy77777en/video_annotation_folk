    "pre_caption": "The video features a black sports car with prominent branding, including a large \"NOS\" logo on the side. The car has a sleek, aerodynamic design with visible modifications, such as a rear spoiler and racing decals. It is producing a significant amount of white smoke from its tires, indicating high-speed drifting. The car's dynamic movement and the smoke trail emphasize its speed and agility. The vehicle's orientation changes, showcasing its drifting capability on a wide, open track.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video has a **main subject with dynamic size**, so the description should focus on them. Don't mention the background scene and other motion.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the black sports car and its primary action of drifting, it misses several key visual details that would make the description more comprehensive and aligned with the instructions. For instance, the caption mentions \"racing decals\" but fails to specify their color and design; in the video, the car has distinct red and white angular stripes running along its doors, in addition to the \"NOS\" logo. The description also omits the car's gold-colored rims, a prominent feature that contrasts with the black body. Furthermore, a driver wearing a white helmet is briefly visible through the driver-side window as the car turns, a secondary subject that is entirely unmentioned. The description of the setting as a \"wide, open track\" is too generic; the video clearly shows the car drifting on a dark asphalt surface marked with bright orange cones that outline the course. Finally, the last two sentences are somewhat redundant and interpretive. Instead of stating that the movement \"emphasize[s] its speed and agility\" and \"showcas[es] its drifting capability,\" a more direct and objective description would be to state that the car slides sideways around the track, its rear tires emitting thick plumes of white smoke, while its front wheels are angled in the opposite direction of the turn.",
