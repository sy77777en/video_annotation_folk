    "pre_caption": "The video features a man and a woman in a bathroom setting. The man, with medium-length dark hair and a beard, is wearing a white shirt and a tie. He is initially sitting in a bathtub filled with bubbles and later stands up, holding a book. The woman, with short hair, is lying in the bathtub with her head resting on the edge, wearing a pink shower cap. A rubber duck is floating in the bubbles near her. The scene is lit by natural light coming through a window with blinds, casting patterns on the wall. The overall atmosphere is calm and domestic.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subjects and their unusual activities, it could be refined for greater precision and adherence to the instructions. The description uses the generic term \"person\" for both individuals; if their apparent genders are discernible, specifying \"a man\" and \"a woman\" would provide a more complete picture. The phrase \"enjoying a bath\" is a subjective interpretation of the second person's state and should be replaced with a more objective description of their posture, such as \"lying back with their eyes closed beneath the cucumber slices.\" The final sentence about the natural light and patterns on the wall describes the environment rather than the subjects, which should be omitted as the focus is on the people. Additionally, the caption misses an opportunity to detail the transition between the first person sitting and standing; it should clarify if this happens in a single continuous motion or via a hard cut, as this is a key element of the video's structure. Finally, more specific details could be added, such as the color of the tie, the type of book, or the color and style of the headphones (e.g., \"white over-ear headphones\"), to create a more vivid and exact description.",
