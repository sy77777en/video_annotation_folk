    "pre_caption": "The video features a man and a woman in a bathroom setting. The man, with medium-length dark hair and a beard, is wearing a white shirt and a tie. He is initially sitting in a bathtub filled with bubbles and later stands up, holding a book. The woman, with short hair, is lying in the bathtub with her head resting on the edge, wearing a pink shower cap. A rubber duck is floating in the bubbles near her. The scene is lit by natural light coming through a window with blinds, casting patterns on the wall. The overall atmosphere is calm and domestic.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good in some respects but fails to follow several key instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption appears to be factually accurate. It describes specific subjects (a man, a woman, a rubber duck) and their distinct attributes and actions (man in a shirt and tie in a tub, woman with a pink shower cap, man standing up with a book). The description of the setting as a bathroom with a bathtub full of bubbles is consistent with the subjects' actions.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete. It identifies the primary and secondary subjects and describes their key visual attributes and actions over the course of the video (\"initially sitting... and later stands up\"). It successfully creates a holistic picture by combining details from different moments.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is where the caption has significant flaws.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses clear and precise terms like \"man,\" \"woman,\" and \"rubber duck.\"\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides good detail on the subjects' clothing, hair, and actions (e.g., \"man, with medium-length dark hair and a beard, is wearing a white shirt and a tie\").\n*   **Holistic View:** It correctly describes the scene by combining actions over time without referring to specific frames.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The last sentence, \"The overall atmosphere is calm and domestic,\" directly violates this rule by interpreting the mood of the scene.\n2.  **Description of Unnecessary Background Details:** The instruction says, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The sentence, \"The scene is lit by natural light coming through a window with blinds, casting patterns on the wall,\" describes the background lighting and environment in detail that is not necessary to identify or distinguish the man, the woman, or the duck.\n3.  **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The instruction asks to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is an introductory phrase that should have been omitted.\n\n**In summary, while the caption is factually accurate and descriptive, it fails on three critical negative constraints: avoiding subjective language, avoiding unnecessary background details, and avoiding introductory phrases.**",
