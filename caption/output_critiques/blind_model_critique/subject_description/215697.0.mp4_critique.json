    "pre_caption": "The video depicts a vast, abstract cosmic scene filled with swirling clouds of gas and dust in various shades of blue, green, and purple. Numerous small, bright stars are scattered throughout, creating a sense of depth and vastness. The colors blend seamlessly, giving the impression of a dynamic and expansive universe. The overall composition suggests a celestial environment, possibly representing a nebula or a distant galaxy. The visual elements are fluid and ethereal, emphasizing the complexity and beauty of the cosmos.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject as a cosmic scene, it overlooks several key visual details that define the video's content. The color palette is more complex than described, with prominent regions of vibrant pink and fiery orange gas intermingling with the blues and purples, which the caption omits. The description lacks a focal point; it fails to mention the massive, brilliant blue supergiant star positioned slightly off-center, whose intense light illuminates the surrounding gas, or the striking, dark, silhouetted dust lane that cuts horizontally across the nebula, creating a strong visual contrast. The phrase \"swirling clouds\" is too general and does not capture the distinct, towering pillar-like formations of dense gas visible on the right side of the scene. Furthermore, describing the stars as uniformly \"small\" is inaccurate, as the video clearly features the large central star and a dense, glittering cluster of young stars in the upper left. Finally, the caption implies motion with words like \"dynamic\" but doesn't specify the slow, steady pan from left to right that reveals the nebula's vastness, nor the subtle time-lapse effect that shows the gas clouds gently expanding and shimmering.",
