    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it accurately describes the visual content, it violates the rules regarding subjectivity, conciseness for scenery shots, and speculation.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nAssuming the video shows a cosmic scene like a nebula, the caption is **accurate** in its description of the core visual elements. It correctly identifies the presence of \"swirling clouds of gas and dust,\" their colors (\"blue, green, and purple\"), and the \"small, bright stars.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is **complete** in that it covers all the major visual components of the described scene, giving a full picture of what is being shown.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption **fails significantly** in adhering to the instructions in the following ways:\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Language:** The instructions explicitly state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption is filled with subjective and interpretive language.\n    *   **Violations:** \"vast,\" \"abstract,\" \"sense of depth and vastness,\" \"dynamic and expansive,\" \"fluid and ethereal,\" \"complexity and beauty of the cosmos.\" These words describe the impression the scene creates rather than its objective visual attributes.\n\n2.  **Failure to Follow Scenery Shot Protocol:** The video is a scenery shot, which has a specific rule: \"**concisely specify the type of scenery shot... in a single fluent paragraph. Briefly explain why there is no main subject... using one to three sentences.**\"\n    *   **Violation:** The caption is five sentences long, which is not concise. It provides a lengthy, poetic description instead of a brief, factual statement explaining that the focus is on the overall environment.\n\n3.  **Inclusion of Speculation:** The instructions state, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\"\n    *   **Violation:** The phrase \"**possibly representing a nebula or a distant galaxy**\" is a form of speculation. While it's a logical inference, it is not a directly observable fact and should have been omitted.\n\n4.  **Redundant Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"The video depicts,\" which is unnecessary introductory text. The description itself should stand alone.\n\nIn summary, the caption reads more like an artistic interpretation than the objective, factual description required by the instructions. It fails on the core principles of objectivity and conciseness for the specified video type.",
