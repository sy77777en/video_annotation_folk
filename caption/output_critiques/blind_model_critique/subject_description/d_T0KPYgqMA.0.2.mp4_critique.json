    "pre_caption": "The video features a woman in a courtroom setting, wearing a traditional barrister's wig and black robe with white bands. She appears to be speaking, with a focused expression. In the background, there are several people seated, including a man in a suit and glasses, a woman with long hair, and another woman with blonde hair. The woman in the foreground is the primary subject, and her attire and position suggest she is addressing the court. The background figures are less distinct, serving as an audience to the proceedings.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few areas where it could be improved to better align with the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption appears to be accurate. It describes a plausible scene of a woman, dressed as a barrister, speaking in a courtroom. The details provided for her attire and the background subjects are specific and consistent with such a setting.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but is missing some key details requested by the instructions.\n\n*   **Main Subject:** For the main subject (the woman), the instructions ask for details like skin tone, hairstyle (under the wig, if visible), and approximate age. The caption omits these, describing only her clothing, action, and expression.\n*   **Secondary Subjects:** The descriptions of the background figures are brief, which is appropriate, but could be slightly more visually specific if details are available (e.g., \"a man in a dark suit and glasses,\" \"a woman with long, dark hair\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows most of the instructions well, but deviates in a few key areas.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, clear, and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Prioritization:** It correctly identifies the woman in the foreground as the main subject, describes her first and in the most detail, and then briefly covers the secondary subjects in the background.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives and uses cautious phrasing like \"appears to be speaking\" to avoid stating uncertain actions as facts.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It does not use \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Analytical vs. Descriptive Language:** The last two sentences (\"The woman in the foreground is the primary subject...\" and \"The background figures are less distinct, serving as an audience...\") are more analytical than descriptive. The instructions ask for a description of visual attributes. Instead of stating she \"is the primary subject,\" this should be conveyed through the level of detail. Instead of saying they are \"serving as an audience,\" a purely visual description would be \"The people in the background are seated and facing forward.\" The detailed description of the main subject already implies her importance without needing to state it explicitly.\n*   **Missing Visual Attributes:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption fails to include several key visual attributes (like skin tone and age) that are explicitly required by the instructions for describing people.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is good but not perfect.** It successfully captures the essence of the scene in the correct format and tone. However, to be fully compliant with the instructions, it should include more of the required visual details for the main subject and rephrase the final sentences to be purely descriptive rather than analytical.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a woman in a courtroom setting, wearing a traditional barrister's wig and black robe with white bands. She has a medium skin tone and appears to be in her 30s. Her hairstyle under the wig is not visible. She is speaking with a focused expression. In the background, there are several people seated, including a man in a dark suit and glasses, a woman with long, dark hair, and another woman with blonde hair. The people in the background are seated and facing forward, suggesting they are listening to the proceedings.",
