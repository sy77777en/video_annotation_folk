    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres very well to the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and follows the specified format and style guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It uses precise and descriptive language to capture the visual nature of the abstract subject.\n*   **Subject:** \"glowing golden particles\" is a perfect identification.\n*   **Form & Texture:** Describing the collective as a \"dense, flowing stream\" and the individual components as resembling \"fine glitter or dust\" is very effective.\n*   **Visual Details:** The mention of particles varying in size and brightness, appearing as \"sharp, luminous specks\" and \"larger, softer, out-of-focus orbs,\" accurately captures the depth-of-field effect common in such animations. The color description (\"shades of yellow, gold, and amber\") is also specific and accurate.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive, covering all the essential visual information without adding unnecessary details. It successfully paints a full picture of the video's content.\n*   It describes the subject (particles), their collective behavior (a flowing stream), their individual characteristics (size, brightness, color), their motion (\"moves in a gentle curve\"), and the setting (\"solid black background\").\n*   It successfully synthesizes these details into a coherent overview of the entire video rather than describing a single moment.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the given rules almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-written paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It correctly identifies the \"stream of... particles\" as the main subject and focuses the entire description on its attributes.\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"video.\"\n*   **Use of Motion/Background:** It mentions the background (\"solid black background\") and motion (\"moves in a gentle curve\") appropriately, as they are essential for describing the subject and its context.\n*   **Language:** The language is simple, natural, and objective, avoiding emotional or overly subjective adjectives. \"Gentle\" and \"sparkling\" are used descriptively rather than subjectively.\n*   **Speculation:** The caption is excellent here, with one minor exception. The phrase \"A faint, warm light source is **suggested**\" slightly deviates from the rule \"avoid describing what is not visible.\" While the *effect* (a glow) is visible, the source is not. A stricter adherence might have described only the visible glow itself. However, using the word \"suggested\" shows a careful awareness of this distinction and is a very minor point.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe caption is **very good**. It is a high-quality description that demonstrates a strong understanding of all instructions. The level of detail, clarity, and adherence to the rules is exemplary. The minor point about the \"suggested\" light source is the only, very slight, deviation from a perfect score.",
