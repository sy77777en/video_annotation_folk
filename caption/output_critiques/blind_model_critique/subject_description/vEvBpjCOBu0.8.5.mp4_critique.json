    "pre_caption": "The video features a grayscale emblem, centrally positioned against a dark, textured background. The emblem is circular and depicts a hammer and a compass at its center, encircled by a wreath of wheat ears. At the base of the wreath, a tricolor ribbon, rendered in shades of gray, is visible. The emblem is lit from above, creating highlights and shadows that give it a three-dimensional, metallic or stone-like appearance. Throughout the video, the spotlight on the emblem gradually dims, causing the emblem to fade into the black background until it is no longer visible.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text.",

  "generated_critique": "The critique of the caption is as follows:\n\nThe description of the background as \"dark, textured\" is somewhat vague; in the video, the texture appears to be a rough, pitted concrete wall, which gives the emblem a more industrial and monumental context that the caption misses. The caption is also indecisive about the emblem's material, suggesting it could be \"metallic or stone-like.\" The sharp, specular highlights that glint off the edges of the hammer and compass as the light plays across them strongly indicate a brushed or polished metal, a detail that should be stated more definitively. Furthermore, the description of the \"tricolor ribbon\" could be more precise; the video clearly shows three distinct horizontal bands—a light gray top stripe, a dark gray middle one, and a medium gray bottom stripe—which is a specific design element not captured by the current text. Lastly, the description of the fade-out is slightly oversimplified. Instead of just dimming, the light source appears to narrow slightly before it fades completely, causing the shadows to deepen and creep across the emblem's face, momentarily enhancing its three-dimensional relief before it is fully engulfed by the black background. The caption also omits that the video holds on the pure black screen for a couple of seconds after the emblem disappears, which is a key part of the sequence's pacing and finality.",
