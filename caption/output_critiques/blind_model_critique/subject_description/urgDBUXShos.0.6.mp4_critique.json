    "pre_caption": "A man with white face paint, smeared red lipstick, dark eye makeup, and messy, shoulder-length, greenish-yellow hair stands in close proximity to a woman with brown hair styled in an updo. The man, wearing a dark purple jacket, holds the woman's jaw with a black-gloved hand while pressing a small, sharp blade to her cheek. The woman, wearing a dark sleeveless top, has her head tilted back. The perspective shifts, circling around the man, initially showing him on the right and the woman on the left, before his back momentarily obscures her, and the view settles with the man on the left and the woman on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The shot begins with a close-up of the woman's side on the left side of the frame and the clown's side on the right side. The camera rotates around the clown, moving from the left side view to the back and then to the right side view. During this transition, the woman is momentarily blocked by the clown. In the end, the positions of the two characters in the frame swap, with the clown on the left and the woman on the right, showing a medium close-up shot of them.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately outlines the subjects and the basic action, it misses the intense emotional tone conveyed through their expressions. The man's face is not neutral; he wears a wide, menacing smile throughout, and the white paint is cracked around his mouth from the expression. The woman's face is a mask of terror, with wide, tear-filled eyes and a trembling lower lip, a detail more significant than her hairstyle. The \"small, sharp blade\" is specifically a silver paring knife, and its sharp point visibly indents her skin, creating a palpable sense of danger that the word \"presses\" doesn't fully capture. Furthermore, the man's hand doesn't just \"support\" her neck; it's a firm, controlling grip, with his gloved thumb pressing against her throat. The circling camera movement is less about a simple perspective shift and more about slowly revealing the chilling satisfaction on the man's face as the view changes, making the moment his back obscures her a point of heightened tension rather than a simple transition.",
