    "pre_caption": "This video presents an industrial scenery shot from a high-angle perspective aboard a container ship docked at a port. The view looks out over stacks of multicolored shipping containers on the ship's deck towards a massive white ship-to-shore crane, which is labeled \"SAVANNAH, GA. U.S.A no 39\" and dominates the frame. In the background, a wide river and the sprawling port with more cranes and container stacks are visible under a grey, overcast sky. The scene is captured through a lens spattered with raindrops, adding to the gloomy, wet atmosphere. There is no single main subject, as the composition emphasizes the immense scale of the maritime shipping operation and the industrial environment rather than focusing on a specific object or action.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Your description provides a strong foundation by establishing the setting, camera perspective, and overall atmosphere effectively. However, after reviewing the video, the caption feels more like a description of a static photograph than a moving scene. The most significant omission is the lack of any described action; in the video, the massive white ship-to-shore crane is not stationary but is actively operating, with its trolley moving horizontally along the boom and the spreader slowly descending towards the containers on the deck, suggesting it is in the process of loading or unloading. The caption's claim that there is \"no single main subject\" is also debatable, as the crane's movement and central, dominant position make it the undeniable focal point of the entire video. While the scale is important, the crane is the primary actor within that environment. Furthermore, the description of the containers as simply \"multicolored\" is too general; the video clearly shows a mix of vibrant red, blue, and orange containers alongside more weathered grey and green ones, some bearing visible logos like \"Maersk\" and \"Hapag-Lloyd.\" Finally, while distant and small, there are figures of dockworkers in high-visibility vests visible on the pier below, and their presence, however minor, is a key detail that adds to the sense of scale and activity that the caption aims to convey. Incorporating the crane's movement and acknowledging it as the primary subject would make the description a more accurate reflection of the video's content.",
