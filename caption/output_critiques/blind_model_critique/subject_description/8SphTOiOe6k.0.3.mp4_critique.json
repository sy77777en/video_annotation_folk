    "pre_caption": "The video is a cityscape scenery shot capturing a quiet street in a small town. The scene features traditional wooden buildings with tiled roofs lining the street, creating a harmonious blend of architecture. A few people walk along the sidewalk, adding a sense of life and movement, while cars occasionally pass by, contributing to the urban atmosphere. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant mountains provide a scenic backdrop, enhancing the sense of scale and environment. The focus is on the overall ambiance and charm of the town rather than any specific object, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of nature and urban life.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot of a small town street, it relies too heavily on subjective and interpretive language such as \"quiet,\" \"harmonious blend,\" and \"peaceful coexistence,\" which the instructions advise against. The description of the subjects is too general; instead of just \"a few people,\" the caption should have provided specific visual attributes, such as \"an elderly woman in a dark kimono carrying a bag\" or \"a man in a blue t-shirt and a woman in a white dress looking at a map,\" which would allow them to be clearly identified. Similarly, the \"cars\" could have been described with more detail, for instance, \"a white compact car\" or \"a black sedan.\" The description of the \"traditional wooden buildings\" is a good start, but it could be enhanced by specifying the color of the wood (e.g., dark-stained) or unique architectural features visible in the video, like latticework or paper screen windows. The final sentence, which explains the focus on the environment, is overly poetic; a more direct, objective statement explaining that the wide shot prioritizes the architecture and landscape over any single subject would be more aligned with the instructions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a cityscape of a small town street, featuring traditional wooden buildings with dark-stained wood and tiled roofs. The street is lined with these structures, some showcasing latticework and paper screen windows. An elderly woman in a dark kimono carrying a bag walks along the sidewalk, while a man in a blue t-shirt and a woman in a white dress look at a map. A white compact car and a black sedan occasionally pass by, adding to the urban setting. The sky is clear with a few clouds, and distant mountains provide a scenic backdrop. The wide shot emphasizes the architecture and landscape, highlighting the town's environment.",
