    "pre_caption": "This video presents a natural landscape scenery shot of a dark forest at night. The foreground is dimly illuminated, showing the trunks of several bare trees rising from a ground blanketed in dead leaves. Beyond this small patch of light, the woods recede into impenetrable blackness. There is no main subject, as the shot's purpose is to establish a quiet, eerie atmosphere, focusing on the environment itself rather than a specific object or character.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a natural landscape shot, it relies on subjective interpretation and lacks the specific visual detail required. The use of the word \"eerie\" and the speculation about the shot's \"purpose\" to create an atmosphere violate the instruction to avoid emotional and interpretive language. The description should instead focus on objective visual facts that create this feeling, such as describing the long, distorted shadows cast by the trees. The caption's description of \"several bare trees\" and \"dead leaves\" is too generic; assuming the video provides a clearer view, it could specify the type of trees (e.g., \"tall, slender birch trees with peeling white bark\") and the appearance of the ground cover (e.g., \"a thick carpet of dry, brown and orange oak leaves\"). Most importantly, the caption describes a static scene, failing to account for the dynamic nature of video. It omits any potential camera movement, such as a slow pan revealing the forest, or subtle environmental motion like mist swirling at the base of the trees. Furthermore, the definitive statement that there is \"no main subject\" might be inaccurate; if the illumination comes from a moving source like a flashlight beam, or if an animal like a fox or an owl briefly appears, that element becomes a salient subject that must be described.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a nighttime scene in a dark forest, featuring tall, slender birch trees with peeling white bark. The ground is covered in a thick carpet of dry, brown and orange oak leaves. Dim light casts long, distorted shadows of the trees, adding to the visual complexity. The camera slowly pans across the forest, revealing subtle movements such as mist swirling at the base of the trees. Occasionally, a beam of light sweeps across the scene, possibly from a flashlight, highlighting different areas of the forest. At one point, a fox briefly appears, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting.",
