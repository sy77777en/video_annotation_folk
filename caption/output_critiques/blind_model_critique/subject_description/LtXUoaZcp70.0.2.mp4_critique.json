    "pre_caption": "A translucent, blue, 3D representation of a man stands behind a simple, brown, four-legged wooden table. The man is wearing what appears to be a collared shirt and trousers and has his hands clasped in front of him. On the table sits a rectangular box that emits a bright, fiery red-orange glow. In the lower-left corner, the name \"Georg Elser\" is displayed in a white, typewriter-style font.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is highly accurate. It correctly identifies a \"translucent, blue, 3D representation of a man,\" which is a precise and fitting description for the stylized figure. It also accurately describes the \"brown, four-legged wooden table,\" the \"rectangular box that emits a bright, fiery red-orange glow,\" and the specific text \"Georg Elser\" in a \"white, typewriter-style font.\"\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive, capturing all the essential subjects and their key attributes. It details the man's pose (\"hands clasped\"), apparent clothing (\"collared shirt and trousers\"), the table's basic structure, the box's most prominent feature (its glow), and the location and style of the text overlay. No significant visual information is omitted.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a single, clear, and concise paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n    *   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on describing the subjects (man, table, box, text) and their visual attributes, correctly avoiding mention of the plain background.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n    *   **Objectivity:** It uses descriptive, objective language (\"translucent,\" \"blue,\" \"four-legged\") and avoids subjective emotional terms.\n    *   **Handling Uncertainty:** The phrase \"what appears to be a collared shirt and trousers\" is an excellent example of following the instruction to avoid describing what is uncertain, given the figure's stylized nature.\n    *   **Subject Prioritization:** The description follows a logical order, starting with the main subject (the man), then the objects directly associated with him (the table and the box), and finally the text overlay.\n    *   **Precise Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"3D representation of a man,\" \"wooden table,\" and \"typewriter-style font\" as instructed.",
