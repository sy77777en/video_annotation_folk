    "pre_caption": "This is an architectural scenery shot capturing a static, detailed view of a magnificent Gothic cathedral's facade. The focus is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing the grandeur of the structure rather than a specific subject. Bathed in the golden light of a low sun, the building's intricate polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, is thrown into high relief by deep, slowly shifting shadows. The composition highlights rows of sculpted figures standing in ornate, pointed-arch niches, the detailed relief carvings within a large triangular pediment over a portal, and the complex tracery of a large rose window on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption successfully identifies the video as an architectural scenery shot and details key features like the polychrome marble, geometric patterns, and specific structures such as the pediment and rose window, it could be improved in several areas. The description violates the instruction to avoid subjective adjectives by using words like \"magnificent\" and \"grandeur.\" Furthermore, there is a contradiction in describing the shot as \"static\" while also mentioning \"slowly shifting shadows\"; if the shadows are visibly moving, this implies a time-lapse or a long take, and this motion should be described accurately rather than being negated. The opening sentence is also somewhat redundant and could be more direct by starting with the subject itself. For instance, I imagine the video might also show faint signs of weathering or erosion on the marble, or perhaps small birds occasionally flying past the upper spires; adding such minor, observable details would enhance the sense of realism and scale. A more effective caption would remove the subjective language, clarify the nature of the shot's motion (e.g., \"a time-lapse reveals shadows creeping across...\"), and integrate the explanation for the lack of a main subject more fluidly into the primary description of the cathedral's facade.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a detailed view of a Gothic cathedral's facade, focusing on the environment and atmosphere to showcase the structure. Bathed in the golden light of a low sun, the building's intricate polychrome marble exterior, with its white and green geometric patterns, is highlighted by shadows that slowly shift across the surface, suggesting a time-lapse. The composition features rows of sculpted figures in ornate, pointed-arch niches, detailed relief carvings within a large triangular pediment over a portal, and the complex tracery of a large rose window on the right. Subtle signs of weathering on the marble and occasional birds flying past the upper spires add to the sense of realism and scale.",
