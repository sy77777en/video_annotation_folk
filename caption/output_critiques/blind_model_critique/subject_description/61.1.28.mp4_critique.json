    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the main subject with rich detail but fails to adhere to a few key negative constraints in the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description of the man is highly accurate and specific. It correctly identifies his skin tone, hairstyle (\"long dreadlocks\"), facial hair (\"gray beard\"), and numerous articles of clothing and accessories (\"large, light-colored hat,\" \"oversized white sunglasses,\" \"green jacket,\" \"patterned shirt,\" \"silver chain necklace\").\n*   **Completeness:** The caption provides a thorough and complete description of the subject's appearance, pose (\"facing the camera directly\"), and expression (\"neutral\"), giving a clear mental image of the person in the video.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of information in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Focus on Subject:** The primary focus is correctly placed on the man, his features, and his attire.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing the subject's key visual attributes in detail, as requested.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n\n1.  **Describing the Background:** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The caption violates this by describing the setting: \"...in a lively setting, with colorful lights and decorations around him.\" This detail is not necessary to identify or distinguish the man.\n2.  **Using Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The word \"lively\" is a subjective interpretation of the setting's atmosphere.\n3.  **Describing Uncertainty:** The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The phrase \"appears to be\" introduces a level of uncertainty that should be avoided. A better approach is to state only what is clearly visible.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is strong in its descriptive detail of the main subject but weak in its adherence to the negative constraints. To be fully compliant, the last two sentences should be revised or removed.\n\n**A better, fully compliant version would be:**\n\n\"A man with dark skin, long dreadlocks, and a gray beard faces the camera. He wears a large, light-colored hat, oversized white sunglasses, a green jacket over a patterned shirt, and a silver chain necklace. His expression is neutral.\"",
