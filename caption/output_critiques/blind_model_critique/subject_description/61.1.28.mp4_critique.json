    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with dark skin and long dreadlocks, wearing a large, light-colored hat and oversized white sunglasses. He has a gray beard and is dressed in a green jacket over a patterned shirt. A silver chain necklace is visible around his neck. The man appears to be in a lively setting, with colorful lights and decorations around him. His expression is neutral, and he is facing the camera directly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good foundational description of the man, it lacks the specificity and dynamic detail expected for a video. The description of his attire, such as the \"large, light-colored hat\" and \"green jacket,\" is too general; imagining the video, the hat is a distinct off-white fedora with a black band, and the jacket is an olive-green bomber jacket with patches on the sleeves, details that would significantly improve identification. The \"patterned shirt\" is actually a vibrant Hawaiian print with red and yellow flowers, a key visual element that is undersold. Furthermore, the caption portrays a static scene, which is unlikely for a video. In the imagined footage, the man is not just facing the camera directly but subtly nodding his head to an unheard beat, and at one point, he briefly turns his head to the left, revealing a silver hoop earring in his left ear that the caption misses entirely. The \"neutral expression\" is also a simplification; with his mouth slightly upturned at the corners, his expression is more accurately described as relaxed or content. Finally, while the caption correctly notes a \"lively setting,\" it fails to mention the blurred figures of people dancing in the background, which provides crucial context for the colorful lights and the man's presence in that environment.",
