    "pre_caption": "The video features several athletes running on a track. The most prominent subject is a man in a blue athletic outfit, sprinting energetically. He is positioned towards the right side of the track. Another athlete, wearing a yellow and black outfit, is visible further back on the track. A third runner, in a red and white outfit, is also present, positioned between the other two athletes. All subjects are focused on the race, displaying determined expressions. The scene captures the intensity and competitive nature of a track event.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description. Clearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects in focus**, so you need to focus on them. Try to describe them in details and avoid mentioning any scene contents. \n",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why it fails to meet the requirements:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description (e.g., a man in blue, another in yellow/black), the caption is factually accurate in its basic description of the subjects and their clothing colors.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete. The instructions state: \"For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression.\"\n\n*   The caption successfully describes clothing color (\"blue athletic outfit,\" \"yellow and black outfit\").\n*   However, it completely omits any mention of skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, or approximate age for any of the athletes. While these details might not be clear in the video, a good caption would include them if they were discernible. The current caption lacks this level of detail.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThis is where the caption has the most significant failures.\n\n**Major Violations:**\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:** The instructions explicitly state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions**\" and to focus on visual attributes. The caption violates this rule multiple times:\n    *   \"...sprinting **energetically**.\" - \"Energetically\" is an interpretation of the action's quality, not a visual attribute. \"Sprinting\" is sufficient.\n    *   \"...displaying **determined** expressions.\" - \"Determined\" is an interpretation of an emotional state. The instruction is to describe the visual facts of the expression (e.g., \"with brows furrowed\" or \"mouths open\"), not the emotion you infer from it.\n    *   \"The scene captures the **intensity** and **competitive nature** of a track event.\" - This entire final sentence is a subjective summary of the video's mood and theme. It does not describe a subject or a visual attribute but instead interprets the overall feeling of the scene, which is explicitly against the instructions.\n\n**Minor Strengths (Where it Followed Instructions):**\n\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n*   **Clarity and Structure:** It correctly identifies subject types (\"athletes,\" \"man\") and distinguishes between them using their clothing and location (\"man in a blue athletic outfit,\" \"further back on the track\").\n*   **Focus:** It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and correctly combines details into a general description.\n*   **Prioritization:** It follows the instruction to prioritize subjects by starting with the \"most prominent\" one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fundamentally misunderstands the core instruction to be objective and descriptive rather than subjective and interpretive. The inclusion of emotional language (\"determined\"), qualitative adverbs (\"energetically\"), and a thematic summary (\"intensity and competitive nature\") are direct violations that make the caption unacceptable according to the provided rules.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features several athletes running on a track. The most prominent subject is a man in a blue athletic outfit, positioned towards the right side of the track. He appears to be in his 20s or 30s, with short black hair and a clean-shaven face. His skin tone is medium. Another athlete, wearing a yellow and black outfit, is visible further back on the track. This athlete has a light skin tone, short brown hair, and appears to be in a similar age range. A third runner, in a red and white outfit, is positioned between the other two athletes. This runner has a dark skin tone, short curly hair, and is also clean-shaven. All subjects have focused expressions, with brows furrowed and mouths slightly open, indicating their concentration on the race. The scene captures the visual details of a track event.",
