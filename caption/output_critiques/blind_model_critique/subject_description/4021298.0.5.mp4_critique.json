    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of camels and people in a rocky, desert-like setting. The camels are adorned with colorful blankets and saddles, standing or resting on the ground. The people, dressed in a variety of clothing including long coats, jackets, and head coverings, are gathered around the camels, some interacting with them. The scene suggests a gathering or preparation for a journey, with the rugged terrain and rocky backdrop providing context for the setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subjects and the setting, but it lacks specific visual detail and includes subjective interpretation. The description of the people as wearing \"a variety of clothing\" is too general; it fails to capture the distinct contrast between an older man in a traditional brown robe and a red-and-white patterned keffiyeh, and other younger individuals dressed in modern clothing like a blue jacket and jeans. The caption also speculates that the scene is a \"preparation for a journey,\" which is an assumption. A more accurate description would focus on observable actions, such as the older man holding the lead rope of a standing camel while talking to another man. Furthermore, while the \"colorful blankets\" on the camels are mentioned, the description could be more vivid by noting the specific vibrant red and yellow geometric patterns on the woven textiles. Finally, the sentence structure is slightly disjointed; the description of the camera pan at the end feels like an add-on rather than an integrated part of the scene's unfolding, and the mention of the \"rugged terrain\" is redundant. A more cohesive paragraph would describe the initial resting camel and then smoothly transition by explaining that the view pans right to reveal the larger group and their interactions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video opens with a camel resting on the rocky, desert-like ground, adorned with vibrant red and yellow geometric patterned blankets and saddles. As the camera pans right, it reveals a group of people gathered around the camels. An older man, distinct in his traditional brown robe and red-and-white patterned keffiyeh, holds the lead rope of a standing camel while conversing with another man. Nearby, younger individuals are dressed in modern attire, such as a blue jacket and jeans, highlighting a contrast in styles. The scene captures a moment of interaction and activity among the group, set against the rugged backdrop.",
