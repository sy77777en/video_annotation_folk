    "pre_caption": "The video features four people inside a room. A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a blue and white plaid dress, is prominently featured moving quickly across the foreground towards the right. In the background, an older man with balding grey hair, wearing a yellow patterned sweater vest over a white shirt and dark trousers, stands holding a young child. The child is dressed in a light-colored outfit and a white cap or bonnet. To the left, partially obscured, another woman with dark hair, wearing a red hat and a patterned dress, is seated on a couch.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that adheres to the provided instructions with a high degree of precision.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It describes specific, verifiable details such as \"short blonde hair,\" \"blue and white plaid dress,\" \"yellow patterned sweater vest,\" and \"red hat.\" It correctly identifies the number of subjects (four people) and their types (woman, man, child). The description of actions (\"moving quickly,\" \"stands holding,\" \"seated\") and positions (\"foreground,\" \"background,\" \"to the left\") accurately portrays a dynamic scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It accounts for all the salient subjects in the scene and provides sufficient detail for each one. It successfully establishes the relationships between them (man holding a child) and their relative importance (the woman in the foreground is \"prominently featured\"). The mention that one woman is \"partially obscured\" is a key detail that adds to the completeness of the description by acknowledging the limits of what is visible.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the given instructions exceptionally well:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, coherent paragraph without being overly wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The entire description is focused on the four people, their appearances, and their actions, as instructed.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole, referencing movement (\"moving quickly\") that happens over time, rather than describing a single static frame.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It correctly avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It uses \"background\" and \"moving\" justifiably, as they are necessary to distinguish subjects by location and action, which is explicitly allowed by the instructions.\n*   **No Speculation:** The caption sticks to what is visible. The use of \"cap or bonnet\" is a good example of describing an ambiguous item without making a definitive, unprovable claim.\n*   **Clear and Natural Language:** The paragraph is written in simple, fluent English.\n*   **Subject Differentiation and Prioritization:** It does an excellent job of distinguishing the subjects. It starts with the most prominent subject (\"A woman...prominently featured\") and then moves to the subjects in the background, following a logical order of importance. The two women are clearly differentiated by their hair, clothing, and location.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to follow the detailed instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, comprehensive, and clear. It successfully balances the need for detail with the requirement for conciseness.",
