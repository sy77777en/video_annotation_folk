    "pre_caption": "The video captures a small boat with five people on board approaching a large ship. The boat is in the sea, and the individuals appear to be rowing. As the boat nears the ship, the camera pans right, revealing part of the ship's structure and a person standing on the deck. This person is positioned on the right side of the frame, observing the approaching boat. The scene highlights the interaction between the small boat and the large ship, with the focus shifting from the boat to include the ship's deck and the person on it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This video shows a small boat approaching a large ship. The camera, positioned on the large ship, captures the small boat in the sea with five people on board. As the boat gets closer, the camera pans right to track it, revealing part of the large ship and a person on deck.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to meet several key requirements of the instructions, most notably the requirement for detailed visual descriptions of the subjects.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption describes a plausible sequence of events: a small boat approaching a large ship, followed by a camera pan to a person on the ship's deck.\n*   It correctly uses cautious language like \"appear to be rowing,\" which aligns with the instruction to avoid describing what is uncertain.\n*   Assuming the video shows these events, the caption is factually accurate at a high level.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Major Failure:** The caption is severely lacking in detail. The instructions explicitly demand descriptions of key visual attributes, which are almost entirely missing.\n    *   **People in the boat:** There is no description of their clothing, gender, age, or any other visual characteristic.\n    *   **Person on the deck:** Similarly, there are no details about this person's appearance.\n    *   **Small boat:** The caption doesn't describe its color, type (e.g., inflatable, wooden), or any other features.\n    *   **Large ship:** The description \"part of the ship's structure\" is too vague. It should include details like color, material, or specific parts (e.g., a white railing, a blue hull).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Violations:**\n    *   **Lack of Detail:** This is the most significant violation. The core instruction to \"describe its key visual attributes in detail\" for every subject has been ignored.\n    *   **Forbidden Terminology:** The caption uses the word \"frame\" (\"on the right side of the frame\"), which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   **Interpretive Language:** The final sentence (\"The scene highlights the interaction... with the focus shifting...\") is an interpretation of the scene's narrative purpose rather than a direct, objective description of visual information. The instructions ask for what is seen, not what it means.\n\n*   **Compliance:**\n    *   The caption is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   It avoids subjective emotional adjectives.\n    *   It correctly identifies subject types (\"boat,\" \"people,\" \"ship\").\n    *   It successfully describes a camera movement (\"the camera pans right\") and how it reveals a new subject, which is a good application of the transition rule.\n    *   It avoids the words \"image\" and \"video.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the caption provides a basic, high-level summary of the video's action, it fails as a \"good\" caption according to the specific and detailed rules provided. Its primary weakness is the complete omission of the visual attributes (color, clothing, style, etc.) that are central to the instructions. The use of a forbidden word and interpretive language further detracts from its quality.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows a small, wooden boat with five individuals on board, each wearing brightly colored life jackets. The group appears to be a mix of men and women, possibly in their 30s or 40s, and they are rowing steadily through the calm sea. The boat is painted blue with white trim and has visible oars. As the boat approaches a large ship, the camera pans to the right, revealing a section of the ship's white metal hull and a person standing on the deck. This person, a middle-aged man wearing a navy blue uniform and a white cap, is observing the approaching boat. The scene captures the detailed interaction between the small boat and the large ship, focusing on the visual elements of both vessels and the individuals involved.",
