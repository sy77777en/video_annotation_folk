    "pre_caption": "The video features a bustling street scene with various subjects. A red bicycle with a basket is parked next to a vending machine displaying colorful charts. Several people are walking nearby, including a woman in a tan jacket and black shorts, and another person in a white outfit.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it could be improved to better align with the instructions. It successfully captures the essence of the scene in a concise paragraph but misses some key requirements regarding detail and objectivity.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption appears accurate. It identifies specific, verifiable subjects and their attributes (a red bicycle, a woman in a tan jacket, hanging lanterns). Without the video, a definitive judgment on accuracy is impossible, but the details provided are concrete and plausible.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is moderately complete but misses opportunities for more detail as required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Strengths:** It effectively identifies a variety of subjects (a bicycle, a vending machine, multiple people, a storefront) to give a comprehensive overview of the scene.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The description of the people is too brief. The instructions ask for details like \"hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity\" in addition to clothing. The caption only mentions clothing (e.g., \"woman in a tan jacket and black shorts\"). If other details were visible, they should have been included to make the description more complete. For example, \"a woman with brown hair in a ponytail, wearing a tan jacket...\" would be a more thorough description.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows many instructions well but deviates from a few important ones.\n\n*   **What it does well:**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Clarity and Conciseness:** The language is simple, natural, and easy to understand.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"bicycle,\" \"vending machine,\" \"woman,\" \"person\") instead of vague ones.\n    *   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole without referring to specific frames.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It successfully distinguishes between different people by their clothing (\"woman in a tan jacket,\" \"person in a white outfit\").\n\n*   **Where it falls short:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses \"bustling\" and \"lively.\" These words are interpretive summaries of the scene's atmosphere rather than objective descriptions of visual facts. A more compliant description would state the facts that lead to this conclusion, such as \"Many people are walking and gathered on the street.\"\n    *   **Lack of Detail:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption fails to provide the full range of visual attributes for people that the instructions explicitly request.\n    *   **Interpretive Summary:** The final sentence, \"The scene captures a lively urban environment with a mix of modern and traditional elements,\" is an interpretation of the scene's theme. The instructions emphasize focusing strictly on \"subject types and visual attributes.\" This summary, while helpful for context, goes beyond a direct description of what is visible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **good** because it provides a clear and generally accurate overview of the video's content in the correct format. However, to be a **great** caption that fully adheres to the instructions, it would need to:\n1.  Replace subjective words like \"bustling\" and \"lively\" with objective descriptions of activity.\n2.  Include more detailed visual attributes for the people described (hair, age, etc.), assuming they are visible.\n3.  Remove the final interpretive summary sentence and integrate its core ideas (e.g., \"traditional storefront,\" \"vending machine\") more directly into the subject descriptions.",
