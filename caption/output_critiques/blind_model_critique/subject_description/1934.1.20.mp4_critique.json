    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of five people, all dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of them, a man distinguished by a tall, brown top hat, stands out as he leans over the others, appearing to engage with the screen. The other four individuals, whose faces are not visible, are focused on the screen, which displays a small, white figure. The scene suggests a setting where the group is observing or analyzing something on the screen, with the man in the top hat possibly leading or explaining the situation.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but has one significant flaw that violates a core instruction. It successfully describes the visual elements but fails by including speculation and interpretation.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is accurate in its depiction of the subjects. It correctly identifies a group of five people in white protective suits, one distinguished by a brown top hat, all focused on a screen displaying a white figure.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It effectively captures the main subjects (the group of people), distinguishes the most prominent individual (the man in the top hat), describes their collective action (gathering around a screen), and notes the object of their attention (the figure on the screen). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene's key components.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The first three sentences are a model of concise, factual description.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"people,\" \"man\") and clearly distinguishes between the subjects (\"One of them, a man distinguished by a tall, brown top hat,\" and \"The other four individuals\").\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on key attributes like clothing (\"white protective suits with hoods,\" \"tall, brown top hat\") and pose (\"gathered around,\" \"leans over\").\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Objectivity (Partial):** The majority of the description is objective and based on visual evidence.\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Where the caption fails):**\n    *   **Violation of \"No Speculation\":** The final sentence is the caption's biggest failure. The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\"\n        *   The phrase \"**The scene suggests...**\" is pure interpretation, not a description of a visual fact.\n        *   Describing the action as \"**observing or analyzing**\" infers intent. A more neutral description would be \"looking at.\"\n        *   Stating the man is \"**possibly leading or explaining the situation**\" is complete speculation about his role and the context. This information is not visually present and is exactly what the instructions forbid.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nTo make the caption fully compliant with the instructions, the final speculative sentence should be removed entirely. The phrase \"appearing to engage with the screen\" is also slightly interpretive, but it is a reasonable description of a physical action and is more acceptable than the final sentence.\n\n**A corrected, compliant version of the caption would be:**\n\n\"The video features a group of five people dressed in white protective suits with hoods, gathered around a screen. One of them, a man wearing a tall, brown top hat over his hood, leans over the others toward the screen. The other four individuals, whose faces are not visible, are also focused on the screen, which displays a small, white figure.\"",
