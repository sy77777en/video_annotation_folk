    "pre_caption": "The video features three people in a hallway. In the foreground, a person with voluminous, light-brown curly hair is seen from behind, wearing a rust-colored jacket and a brown leather backpack with crisscrossing straps. Walking towards them from the background is a man with dark hair and a short beard, dressed in a white shirt, a dark jacket, and dark green pants; he is looking down at an open book he holds in his hands. A third person with long, straight dark hair, wearing a black jacket and carrying a white patterned tote bag, enters from the left and is also seen from behind. The man is positioned between the two people who have their backs to the camera as they all walk in the same general area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video opens with a medium shot, showing the back of a curly-haired figure with a backpack walking in the foreground, while a man holding a book approaches from the background. A third figure then enters the scene as all three walk toward each other in a hallway. The curly-haired figure and another person with long dark hair are seen from behind, with the man holding the book partially visible between them.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It successfully adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It provides specific, verifiable details about the three individuals in the video. For example, it correctly identifies attributes like \"voluminous, light-brown curly hair,\" a \"rust-colored jacket,\" a \"brown leather backpack with crisscrossing straps,\" and a man looking at an \"open book.\" These details are precise and objective.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It identifies all the salient subjects (the three people) and describes them thoroughly. It includes:\n*   **Key Visual Attributes:** Detailed descriptions of hair, clothing, and accessories (backpack, book, tote bag) for each person.\n*   **Pose and Action:** It notes that two people are \"seen from behind,\" one \"enters from the left,\" and the man is \"walking towards them\" while \"looking down at an open book.\"\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The final sentence effectively clarifies the positioning of the subjects relative to one another (\"The man is positioned between the two people who have their backs to the camera\").\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, coherent paragraph without being overly wordy.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the three people, their appearance, and their actions, only mentioning the \"hallway\" for essential context.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes the action of the video (people walking, one entering) into a unified description without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame\" and uses precise subject types like \"person\" and \"man.\" Using \"person\" for the subjects seen from behind is appropriate as their gender is not discernible.\n*   **Objective Language:** The description is free of subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It masterfully distinguishes between the three subjects using a combination of location (\"in the foreground\"), appearance (\"man with dark hair\"), and action (\"enters from the left\"). The order of description is logical, starting with the most prominent subject.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as requested.",
