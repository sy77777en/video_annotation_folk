    "pre_caption": "This is a majestic mountain scenery shot, capturing the immense scale of a jagged, snow-covered peak rising into a sky of deep blue and white clouds. Sunlight breaks through the cloud cover to illuminate the upper reaches of the mountain, creating a brilliant glow on the vast fields of snow and ice that contrast sharply with the dark, exposed rock faces below. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the overwhelming grandeur and raw, natural beauty of the alpine environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot and explains the lack of a main subject, it violates the core instruction to avoid subjective adjectives. Words like \"majestic,\" \"immense,\" \"brilliant,\" \"overwhelming grandeur,\" and \"raw, natural beauty\" convey emotion rather than objective visual information. The description also treats the scene as static, whereas the video likely includes dynamic elements such as clouds moving across the sky or shadows shifting across the mountain's face, which should be mentioned to accurately portray the video's content. Furthermore, the description could be more specific; for instance, instead of just \"dark, exposed rock faces,\" it could have detailed the visible texture, such as \"dark grey rock with vertical fissures and patches of loose scree.\" The caption also omits other potential features of the landscape that might be visible, such as a glacial lake at the base of the mountain or a forested valley in the foreground, which would provide important context and a better sense of the environment's composition. A better caption would replace the emotional language with factual details about the light's quality, the specific movement of clouds, and the geological textures of the rock.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a mountain scene with a snow-covered peak rising into a sky filled with deep blue and white clouds. Sunlight filters through the clouds, illuminating the upper sections of the mountain and highlighting the contrast between the snow and the dark grey rock below, which features vertical fissures and patches of loose scree. The video shows dynamic elements, such as clouds moving across the sky and shadows shifting over the mountain's surface. Additional features include a glacial lake at the mountain's base and a forested valley in the foreground, providing context and a comprehensive view of the alpine landscape.",
