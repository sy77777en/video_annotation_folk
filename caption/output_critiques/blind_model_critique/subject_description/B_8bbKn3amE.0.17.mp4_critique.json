    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance against the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good in its structure and its identification of the video type, but it fails significantly on one of the most important negative constraints.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description is highly accurate in capturing the visual elements of a mountain scene. It correctly identifies a \"jagged, snow-covered peak,\" a \"sky of deep blue and white clouds,\" \"sunlight,\" and \"dark, exposed rock faces.\" The interplay of light and shadow is also described accurately.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It successfully follows the specific instruction for a scenery shot by stating the type of shot, explaining that there is no main subject, and noting that the focus is on the environment and scale. It provides a comprehensive overview of the entire scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Correctly Handles Scenery Shots:** The caption perfectly follows the rule for scenery shots. It identifies the video as a \"mountain scenery shot,\" explains why there is no main subject (\"the focus is entirely on the... environment\"), and describes the overall scene.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text, as required.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the scene as a whole, combining elements like the mountain, sky, and light into a unified description.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Major Violation - Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The most significant failure is the violation of the rule: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption is filled with subjective, emotional, and evaluative language.\n    *   **Examples of violations:** \"majestic,\" \"immense scale,\" \"brilliant glow,\" \"overwhelming grandeur,\" and \"raw, natural beauty.\"\n    *   These words describe the *feeling* or *impression* of the scene rather than its objective visual attributes. A better, more compliant description would use neutral terms. For example, instead of \"majestic mountain,\" it would just be \"a large mountain.\" Instead of \"brilliant glow,\" it would be \"sunlight illuminates the snow.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the caption successfully identifies the scene type and follows the structural rules, its heavy reliance on subjective and emotional language is a direct and critical violation of the instructions. To be considered a good caption under the given rules, all subjective adjectives would need to be removed and replaced with neutral, objective descriptions of the visual facts.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a mountain scenery shot, capturing the large scale of a jagged, snow-covered peak rising into a sky of deep blue and white clouds. Sunlight breaks through the cloud cover to illuminate the upper reaches of the mountain, creating a bright contrast on the vast fields of snow and ice against the dark, exposed rock faces below. There is no main subject, as the focus is entirely on the grandeur and natural features of the alpine environment.",
