    "pre_caption": "This video shows a chaotic battle scene involving two men fighting a horde of monstrous creatures in a shallow body of water. One man is clad in a sleek, black, full-body suit with glowing purple, vein-like patterns across it. The other is a man with brown hair and a beard, wearing dark, tactical-looking attire. They are surrounded by numerous aggressive, four-legged creatures with dark, greyish-red skin and multiple limbs, who are lunging and attacking them.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the described video. It successfully adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n*   **Accuracy and Conciseness:** The caption provides a description that is both concise and rich in detail. It immediately establishes the scene (\"chaotic battle scene\"), the location (\"shallow body of water\"), and the subjects involved (\"two men,\" \"horde of monstrous creatures\").\n\n*   **Adherence to Core Instructions:**\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"man\" and \"creatures\" instead of vague words.\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** It provides specific, descriptive details for each subject. For example, \"a sleek, black, full-body suit with glowing purple, vein-like patterns\" and \"four-legged creatures with dark, greyish-red skin and multiple limbs\" create a clear mental picture.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It effectively distinguishes between the two men by describing their unique appearances (\"One man is clad in a sleek, black, full-body suit...\", \"The other is a man with brown hair and a beard...\").\n    *   **Objectivity:** The caption avoids overly subjective or emotional language. Words like \"chaotic\" and \"aggressive\" are used appropriately to describe the nature of the scene and the actions of the creatures (fighting, lunging), which are visually verifiable. \"Monstrous\" is justified by the subsequent description of their unusual anatomy.\n    *   **Structure and Formatting:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph. It avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame\" and does not refer to specific moments in time (e.g., \"at the beginning\").\n    *   **Focus:** The description correctly focuses on the salient subjects and their interactions, which are the most important elements of the video. The background is mentioned only to provide necessary context for the action.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is clear, descriptive, and objective, providing a comprehensive overview of the video's content in the required format.",
