    "pre_caption": "The video features a wide shot of a city street, focusing on a woman walking away from the camera. She is seen from behind, with only her upper body visible. The woman has light-colored hair and is wearing a black coat. The street is lined with tall buildings, and the scene captures the urban environment with its architecture and streetlights. The camera follows her as she walks, maintaining her as the central subject while providing context of the bustling city around her.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **A wide shot of a city street, with the camera following a woman from behind as she walks. The video only shows the upper body of the woman, leaving more context for the street scenery.**\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but fails to adhere to several key instructions. While it accurately captures the general essence of the scene, its wording and structure contain significant violations.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nAssuming the visual content of the video matches the description, the caption is factually accurate. It describes a plausible scene: a woman in a black coat with light hair walking on a city street. The details provided are internally consistent.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is reasonably complete. It successfully identifies the main subject (a woman), her key visual attributes (light-colored hair, black coat), her action and orientation (walking away, seen from behind), and the limited visibility (upper body only). It also provides context by describing the surrounding environment (city street, tall buildings, streetlights).\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThis is where the caption has the most significant issues.\n\n**Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n*   **Subject Identification:** It correctly uses the precise term \"woman\" to identify the main subject.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides good, specific visual attributes like \"light-colored hair\" and \"a black coat.\"\n*   **Focus on Salient Subject:** It correctly prioritizes the woman as the main subject and describes the background as secondary context.\n*   **Clarity:** The description is generally clear and easy to understand.\n\n**Weaknesses (Where the caption violates instructions):**\n*   **Use of Forbidden Introductory Text:** The instruction explicitly states to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is a clear violation of this rule.\n*   **Describing the Medium, Not the Content:** The instructions implicitly guide the user to describe the scene as if they are observing it directly, not watching a recording. The caption violates this by using terms like \"video,\" \"wide shot,\" \"scene,\" and \"camera.\" The phrase \"The camera follows her\" describes a filmmaking technique, not the visual content itself.\n*   **Inclusion of Analytical Language:** The final sentence, \"...maintaining her as the central subject while providing context of the bustling city around her,\" is an analysis of the shot's composition and purpose. The instructions require a purely descriptive account of what is visible, not an interpretation of the director's intent.\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The word \"bustling\" is a subjective adjective that conveys a sense of activity and energy, which the instructions advise against (\"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\").\n*   **Lack of Conciseness:** While not excessively long, the caption could be more concise by removing the analytical and introductory phrases, as instructed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**No, the caption is not good.**\n\nIt fails on several critical, explicitly stated rules. The primary failures are the inclusion of introductory text (\"The video features...\"), the repeated references to the medium itself (\"video,\" \"shot,\" \"camera\"), and the use of analytical rather than purely descriptive language. A good caption would describe the scene directly, without any self-referential or interpretive language.\n\nA better, compliant caption would be:\n\n**A woman with light-colored hair, wearing a black coat, is seen from behind as she walks down a city street. Only her upper body is visible against a background of tall buildings and streetlights.**",
