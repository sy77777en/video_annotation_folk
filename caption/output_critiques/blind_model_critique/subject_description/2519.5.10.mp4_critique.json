    "pre_caption": "A close-up shot focuses on a person's hands in a dimly lit environment. The person, who has a light skin tone, holds their right hand up with the palm open. The tip of the right thumb is covered in a small amount of a wet, red substance that appears to be blood. The left hand is positioned near the right, with the fingers of both hands loosely touching and casting shadows across the right palm. The scene is illuminated by a warm, directional light that highlights the hands against a dark, indistinct background.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video is a **revealing shot of the subject**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the subject is revealed through either subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main subject as a pair of hands and notes the key detail of the red substance, it overlooks the subtle but crucial movements and textures visible in the video. The description of the substance as a \"small amount\" is an understatement; the video shows a distinct, glistening smear of bright red blood covering the entire pad of the thumb, with a slight welling that suggests a fresh cut. The caption also presents the scene as static, but the hands are visibly trembling, a detail that significantly alters the mood. Furthermore, the interaction between the hands is more purposeful than \"loosely touching\"—the fingers of the left hand are shown gently probing the base of the injured right thumb, as if assessing the injury. The lighting, described as \"warm,\" also has a stark, high-contrast quality in the video, casting deep, sharp-edged shadows that accentuate the wrinkles and lines on the skin, a textural detail the caption misses entirely. Improving the description would involve specifying the trembling motion, detailing the precise appearance of the blood, and describing the more deliberate interaction between the hands to better reflect the video's tense and focused nature.",
