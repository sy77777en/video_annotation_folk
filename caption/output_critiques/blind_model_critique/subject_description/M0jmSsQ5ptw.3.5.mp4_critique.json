    "pre_caption": "A model biplane, painted a light tan color, is the central subject. Its top wing is marked with a large roundel consisting of a blue outer circle, a white middle ring, and a red center. The tail rudder features vertical stripes of blue, white, and red. On the side of the fuselage, a light blue patch displays the red number \"4\". The struts connecting the upper and lower wings are painted with red and white stripes. In the foreground, a thick, black, braided rope hangs down, with a small green bag attached to its lower end. A bicycle is visible in the background on a paved surface.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately details the biplane's color scheme and markings, such as the roundel and tail stripes. However, it omits several key visual features of the main subject visible as the camera pans around it. For instance, it fails to mention the stationary, dark brown wooden propeller at the front of the plane or the small pilot figure seated in the open cockpit. The description of the \"thick, black, braided rope\" is also ambiguous; it should clarify that the biplane is suspended from the ceiling by this rope, which is attached to the center of its top wing. Furthermore, the background elements are described too vaguely. The \"bicycle\" is actually a red, vintage-style cruiser leaning against a brick wall, and the \"paved surface\" is a concrete garage floor. The caption completely overlooks the surrounding environment, which is clearly a workshop, as evidenced by the tools and spare model parts scattered across a wooden workbench directly behind the bicycle. Finally, the description misses the weathered texture of the plane's tan fabric covering, which has subtle, dark smudges near the engine cowling, suggesting a realistic, used appearance rather than a pristine model.",
