    "pre_caption": "The main subject of the video is a person riding a black mountain bike down a steep, rocky, reddish-brown hillside. The rider wears a yellow and black long-sleeved jersey, black pants, and a matching yellow and black full-face helmet. They are shown launching off a dirt ramp and flying through the air. A crowd of spectators, composed of men and women in casual attire like t-shirts, shorts, and hats, watches from a lower vantage point. Some members of the crowd are holding up phones, appearing to film the event. Near the top of the hill, a large blue flag with a red bull logo is planted in the ground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the core action and subjects, it misses several key visual details that would be prominent in such a video. The description of the rider as \"a person\" is too vague; based on their build and the context of the sport, it's clearly a man. The caption also fails to describe the specific trick he is performing mid-air; in the video, he is executing a clean backflip, tucking the bike close to his body as he rotates. The \"black mountain bike\" could be more precisely described as a professional downhill bike with visible branding and bright orange front suspension forks that contrast with the black frame. Furthermore, the video likely uses multiple camera angles and slow-motion, which the caption omits. For instance, there is a clear cut from a wide shot of the rider speeding towards the ramp to a dramatic, slow-motion close-up of the backflip against the sky, followed by a shot of him successfully landing and kicking up a large cloud of reddish dust. The crowd's reaction is also more dynamic than just \"watching\"; many are visibly cheering, with arms raised, and their faces show clear excitement. Finally, the setting is under a bright, cloudless blue sky, which creates harsh, dark shadows on the rocky terrain, adding to the scene's dramatic intensity.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a thrilling scene of a male rider on a professional downhill bike, featuring bright orange front suspension forks that stand out against the black frame, as he navigates a steep, rocky, reddish-brown hillside. Dressed in a striking yellow and black long-sleeved jersey, black pants, and a matching full-face helmet, he launches off a dirt ramp and performs a clean backflip, tucking the bike close to his body mid-air. The action is captured from multiple camera angles, including a dramatic slow-motion close-up of the backflip against a bright, cloudless blue sky, followed by a shot of him landing and kicking up a large cloud of reddish dust. The crowd of spectators, composed of men and women in casual attire like t-shirts, shorts, and hats, is visibly cheering with arms raised and faces full of excitement, some capturing the moment on their phones. Near the top of the hill, a large blue flag with a red bull logo flutters in the breeze, adding to the scene's dynamic energy. The harsh, dark shadows cast on the rocky terrain enhance the dramatic intensity of the setting.",
