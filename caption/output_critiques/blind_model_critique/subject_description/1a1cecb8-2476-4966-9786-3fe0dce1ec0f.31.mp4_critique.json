Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot.\" It accurately applies the specific instruction for videos without a salient subject by explaining *why* there is no main subject: \"the focus is on the environment and atmosphere.\" This shows a correct interpretation of the video's content.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is complete for this type of video. It provides the required shot type and a concise explanation, mentioning the key elements of the scene (\"urban setting, trees, and surrounding architecture\") as instructed. It correctly avoids describing non-existent subjects in detail.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Scenery Shot Rule:** The caption is a textbook example of how to apply the rule for scenery shots. It specifies the type and explains the lack of a main subject in two clear sentences, well within the one-to-three sentence limit.\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The language is simple, direct, and easy to understand. The entire description is a single, coherent paragraph.\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective adjectives (e.g., \"beautiful,\" \"bustling\").\n    *   **Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a high-quality response that demonstrates a thorough understanding and precise application of all the given rules, particularly the specific guideline for handling scenery shots.",
