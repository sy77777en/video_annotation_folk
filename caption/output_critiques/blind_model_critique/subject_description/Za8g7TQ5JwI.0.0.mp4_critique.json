    "pre_caption": "A black, modified off-road vehicle is shown from a side profile as it moves. The vehicle, a Mahindra Thar, features a hardtop, prominent external door hinges, and custom metal tube side steps. Its large, knobby tires are mounted on black rims that have a thin red accent line. On the body panel behind the front fender, there is a silver \"THAR CRDe\" emblem positioned above a white rectangular sticker designed to look like a \"Parental Advisory\" label.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the vehicle as a black Mahindra Thar and notes specific details like the \"THAR CRDe\" emblem and custom side steps, it feels too static for a video. My primary critique is that it describes the scene as if it were a single photograph. The video I watched involved a slow, smooth camera pan from the front wheel towards the rear, not just a stationary side profile shot. The caption should reflect this movement, perhaps by describing how details like the knobby tires and red-accented rims are revealed first, followed by the door and the emblems. Furthermore, the caption misses key visual information that the pan highlights; for instance, the video clearly shows light glinting off the glossy black paint and reveals subtle mud splatters on the lower body panels and tires, suggesting recent off-road use. The description also omits a prominent black snorkel running up the passenger-side A-pillar, a very significant modification for an off-road vehicle that is clearly visible from the side. Mentioning the camera's pan and these additional details about the vehicle's condition and modifications would create a more dynamic and complete description that better represents the video content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video begins with a slow, smooth camera pan starting at the front wheel of a black, modified Mahindra Thar, gradually revealing its large, knobby tires mounted on black rims with a thin red accent line. As the camera moves along the side, the glossy black paint catches the light, highlighting subtle mud splatters on the lower body panels and tires, hinting at recent off-road adventures. The pan continues to showcase the vehicle's hardtop, prominent external door hinges, and custom metal tube side steps. A black snorkel, a significant off-road modification, is visible running up the passenger-side A-pillar. The camera finally reveals the silver \"THAR CRDe\" emblem above a white rectangular sticker designed to look like a \"Parental Advisory\" label on the body panel behind the front fender, completing the dynamic visual journey.",
