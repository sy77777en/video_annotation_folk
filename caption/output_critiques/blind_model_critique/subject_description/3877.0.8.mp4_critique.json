    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a hand holding an orange jacket. The hand, belonging to a person wearing a mustard-colored long-sleeve garment, is adorned with a black wristwatch. The jacket is held by its sleeve, and the scene is set against a backdrop of distant, hazy mountains. The focus is on the hand and the jacket, emphasizing the contrast between the bright orange fabric and the muted tones of the surrounding environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to adhere to several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption appears to be factually accurate in describing the subjects (a hand, an orange jacket, a mustard-colored sleeve, a black watch) and the background (hazy mountains). However, its quality is not judged on accuracy alone.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is incomplete. The instructions require describing key visual attributes in detail. For the hand, it fails to mention the skin tone. For the jacket and wristwatch, it only mentions color without describing style, material, or other distinguishing features.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n*   **Includes an Introductory Phrase:** It begins with \"The video features...\", which is an unnecessary introductory phrase that the instructions implicitly discourage by asking for \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A good caption should start directly with the description (e.g., \"A hand holds an orange jacket...\").\n*   **Includes Unnecessary Background Description:** The caption describes the \"backdrop of distant, hazy mountains.\" The instructions state to avoid describing the background unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects, which is not the case here.\n*   **Contains Subjective Analysis and Interpretation:** The final sentence, \"The focus is on the hand and the jacket, emphasizing the contrast between the bright orange fabric and the muted tones of the surrounding environment,\" is a major violation. It analyzes the shot's composition (\"The focus is on...\") and interprets the visual effect (\"emphasizing the contrast...\"). The instructions explicitly state to avoid subjective language and describe only what is visibly present, not the artistic intent or effect.\n\nIn summary, while the caption provides a basic, accurate overview, it breaks fundamental rules by including an introductory phrase, describing the background unnecessarily, and engaging in analysis rather than sticking to a purely objective description of the subjects' visual attributes.",
