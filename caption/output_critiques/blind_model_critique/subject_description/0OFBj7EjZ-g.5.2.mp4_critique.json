    "pre_caption": "The video features a large cylindrical structure with a green, grid-like pattern, resembling a glass or metal facade. This structure is central and prominent, with a smooth, reflective surface. Surrounding it are multiple rectangular windows set in a white or light-colored building, suggesting a modern architectural design. The structure appears to be part of a larger building complex, with the windows arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The overall scene conveys a sense of urban architecture with a focus on the distinctive cylindrical element.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the described video. It effectively and accurately follows all the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description. It uses precise architectural and geometric terms like \"cylindrical structure,\" \"grid-like pattern,\" \"rectangular windows,\" and \"symmetrical pattern.\" These descriptions create a clear and factual mental image of a modern building facade, which is what the video appears to show.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive. It identifies the main subject (\"large cylindrical structure\") and its most important visual attributes (green, grid-like, smooth, reflective). It also includes the secondary subjects (\"rectangular windows,\" \"white or light-colored building\") and describes their relationship to the main subject, providing essential context. The final sentence successfully summarizes the overall scene's character (\"urban architecture with a focus on the distinctive cylindrical element\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption perfectly adheres to the specific rules provided:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a wealth of visual information in a single, compact paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on describing the subjects (the building's components) and their visual attributes.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" and \"video.\" It does not mention motion or background.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective, emotional adjectives. Words like \"large,\" \"central,\" and \"prominent\" are used to describe factual visual hierarchy, not to express an opinion.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details for the objects, such as color (\"green,\" \"white or light-colored\"), shape (\"cylindrical,\" \"rectangular\"), and texture/pattern (\"grid-like,\" \"smooth, reflective\").\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses clear and precise terms like \"cylindrical structure,\" \"windows,\" and \"building.\"\n*   **Clear Subject Prioritization:** It correctly starts with the most \"central and prominent\" subject (the cylindrical structure) before moving to the surrounding elements, as instructed.\n*   **Correct Format:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown formatting.\n*   **Avoids Speculation:** While it uses phrases like \"resembling a glass or metal facade\" and \"suggesting a modern architectural design,\" these are reasonable, visually-grounded inferences that add descriptive value without being speculative guesses. They adhere to the spirit of the instruction by explaining *why* it looks that way (e.g., \"smooth, reflective surface\").",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a prominent cylindrical structure adorned with a green, grid-like pattern, reminiscent of a glass or metal facade. This central feature boasts a smooth, reflective surface, surrounded by numerous rectangular windows embedded in a white or light-colored building, indicative of modern architectural design. The structure is part of a larger building complex, with the windows symmetrically arranged. The scene effectively captures the essence of urban architecture, emphasizing the distinctive cylindrical element.",
