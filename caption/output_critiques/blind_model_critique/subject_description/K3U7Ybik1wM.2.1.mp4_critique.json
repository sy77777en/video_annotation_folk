    "pre_caption": "The video presents a nature scenery shot, specifically a close-up view of a vibrant green meadow dotted with numerous small, bright yellow buttercups and a few tiny white flowers. There is no main subject because the focus is on the overall environment and atmosphere of the flower-filled field, with the camera's shallow depth of field and shifting focus creating a soft, dreamlike quality that emphasizes the collective beauty of the scene rather than singling out any particular flower or element. The gentle sway of the flowers suggests a light breeze, further contributing to the tranquil, natural ambiance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few key areas where it fails to adhere to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the content as a \"nature scenery shot\" featuring a \"green meadow,\" \"yellow buttercups,\" and \"tiny white flowers.\" The description of the colors (\"vibrant green,\" \"bright yellow\") and the motion (\"gentle sway\") accurately reflects what is typically seen in such a video.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully follows the specific instruction for handling scenery shots by not only describing the environment but also explaining why there is no main subject. It mentions the key visual elements and their attributes, providing a comprehensive overview of the scene.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThis is where the caption has some significant issues. While it follows many rules well (e.g., single paragraph, no forbidden words like \"frame,\" identifying the scenery type), it violates others:\n\n*   **Violation 1 (Major): Use of Subjective Adjectives.** The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses several subjective and emotive words, such as \"**dreamlike** quality,\" \"collective **beauty**,\" and \"**tranquil**, natural ambiance.\" These words describe the mood and the viewer's potential feeling rather than objective visual facts.\n*   **Violation 2 (Minor): Describing Cinematography.** The instruction asks for a description of the subjects and the scene. The caption describes the filmmaking technique by mentioning \"the **camera's shallow depth of field and shifting focus**.\" Instead of describing the technique, it should have described the resulting visual effect (e.g., \"some flowers are in sharp focus while others in the foreground and background are softly blurred\").\n*   **Violation 3 (Minor): Introductory Phrase.** The caption starts with \"The video presents...\". The instructions ask for \"only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A better caption would begin directly with the description of the scene itself.\n\n**In summary, the caption is good because it is accurate and comprehensive. However, it is not a perfect caption because it violates the strict rules against using subjective/emotive language and describing camera techniques.**",
