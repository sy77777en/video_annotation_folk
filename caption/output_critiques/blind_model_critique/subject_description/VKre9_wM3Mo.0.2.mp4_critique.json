    "pre_caption": "The video features a white ceramic toilet with a rounded seat and a rectangular tank, viewed from above. The toilet seat is initially raised, revealing the bowl and the inner rim, and then the seat is lowered to cover the bowl, with the lid remaining upright. The toilet has a smooth, glossy surface and a standard design, with the seat and lid both matching in color and material. The orientation of the toilet remains consistent throughout the video, and no other objects or subjects are present.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"white ceramic toilet\" and accurately describes its components (\"rounded seat,\" \"rectangular tank,\" \"bowl,\" \"lid\"). The description of the action—the seat starting in a raised position and then being lowered while the lid remains up—is precise and true to the visual events. The perspective (\"viewed from above\") is also correctly noted.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive without being overly long. It captures all the essential visual information:\n*   **Subject & Attributes:** It details the subject's color, material, shape, and surface texture (\"smooth, glossy\").\n*   **State & Action:** It clearly explains the initial state (\"seat is initially raised\"), the central action (\"seat is lowered\"), and the final state (\"to cover the bowl, with the lid remaining upright\").\n*   **Context:** It helpfully notes that \"no other objects or subjects are present,\" which provides a complete picture of the scene's focus.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule provided in the instructions flawlessly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a full description in a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **Focus on the Subject:** The entire description is dedicated to the toilet and its action, avoiding any mention of the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"white,\" \"rounded,\" \"smooth\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses the specific term \"toilet\" as instructed.\n*   **Describes Action/Transition:** It perfectly describes the movement of the toilet seat as a continuous action rather than a series of static frames.\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown formatting.",
