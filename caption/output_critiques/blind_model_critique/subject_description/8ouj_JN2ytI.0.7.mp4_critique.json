    "pre_caption": "A silhouetted man, wearing a cap, stands in a dark tunnel looking out towards a brightly lit stadium filled with spectators. He is holding a small, dark object in his hands, possibly a phone, and appears to be manipulating it with his fingers, as his hands move in a gesturing or operating motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to fully adhere to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The description is mostly accurate in its depiction of a silhouetted man in a tunnel looking at a stadium. However, it includes speculative language, which compromises its factual accuracy.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption successfully describes the main subject, his key visible attributes (silhouette, cap), his pose, and his location. It appropriately uses the background (stadium, spectators) for context without making it the focus.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption violates a critical instruction: **\"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\"**\n    *   **Violation 1:** The phrase **\"possibly a phone\"** is a direct expression of uncertainty. The instruction requires describing only what is certain. The caption should have described the object by its visible attributes (e.g., \"a small, dark object\") without guessing its identity.\n    *   **Violation 2:** The phrase **\"appears to be manipulating it\"** is another form of speculation. Instead of interpreting the action, the caption should have described the observable motion itself, such as \"moves his fingers over the object.\"\n\nWhile the caption correctly follows other rules—such as being a concise paragraph, using simple English, avoiding subjective adjectives, and focusing on the main subject—the failure to avoid speculation is a significant error.\n\nA better, compliant caption would be:\n\n\"A silhouetted man wearing a cap stands in a dark tunnel, looking out toward a brightly lit stadium filled with spectators. He holds a small, dark object in his hands and moves his fingers over it.\"",
