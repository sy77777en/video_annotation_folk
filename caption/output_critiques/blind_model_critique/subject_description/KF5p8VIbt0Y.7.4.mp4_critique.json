    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a black pen with a red tip and silver accents, suspended horizontally in midair. The focus then shifts to a woman who enters the scene, wearing a white uniform with matching pants and a short-sleeved top, and a white cap. She has light skin and short hair, and her posture is upright as she walks forward. The transition between subjects occurs as the camera moves from the floating pen to the woman entering and advancing through the aisle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **very good** and adheres closely to the provided instructions. It is accurate, detailed, and well-structured.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two main subjects (a pen and a woman) and describes their key visual attributes and the sequence of events precisely. The description of the pen as \"black with a red tip and silver accents, suspended horizontally\" and the woman as wearing a \"white uniform... and a white cap\" with \"light skin and short hair\" is factually correct based on the video's content.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It successfully captures the most essential details of the video in a single, coherent paragraph. It describes the initial subject (the pen), the second subject (the woman), their specific appearances, and the transition between them. It fulfills the requirement to describe subjects in the order they appear.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is both concise and informative. It avoids unnecessary words while providing rich detail.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the subjects (pen, woman) and their attributes, only mentioning motion (\"walks forward,\" \"camera moves\") to explain the action and transition, as permitted.\n    *   **No Speculation or Forbidden Terms:** The caption avoids speculation and forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Objective Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent detail for both the object (color, features, orientation) and the person (clothing, skin tone, hair, posture).\n    *   **Shot Transition:** The caption excels at describing the transition. It clearly states that the focus \"shifts\" and explains *how* it happens: \"the camera moves from the floating pen to the woman.\" This is a perfect execution of the instruction.\n\n### Suggestion for Improvement\n\nWhile the caption is excellent, one minor refinement could make it even more concise by integrating the description of the transition more smoothly. The final sentence is slightly repetitive of the idea introduced in the second sentence.\n\n*   **Original:** \"The focus then shifts to a woman who enters the scene... The transition between subjects occurs as the camera moves from the floating pen to the woman...\"\n*   **Slightly Improved Version:** \"The focus then shifts, with the camera moving away from the pen to follow a woman who enters the scene...\"\n\nThis is a very minor point, and the original caption is already of high quality and fully meets the requirements.",
