    "pre_caption": "The video features a young man walking through a snowy park. He has light skin and short hair, and he is wearing a brown jacket, blue jeans, and brown shoes. He carries a backpack over one shoulder. The man is walking along a path lined with leafless trees and a hedge. In the background, there is a seated person on a bench, dressed in dark clothing, who appears to be looking at the ground. The setting is serene, with snow covering the ground and the branches of the trees.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is excellent feedback. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully captures the main subjects and actions but violates a few key instructions.\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   Assuming the video does show a man in a brown jacket walking in a snowy park with a person on a bench, the description is factually accurate. It correctly identifies subjects, their clothing, and their actions.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is very complete. It describes the primary subject (the young man) in detail, including his appearance, clothing, and what he is carrying. It also includes the secondary subject (the person on the bench) and the key elements of the environment (snow, trees, path), providing a full picture of the scene.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption adheres to many instructions well, but fails on three specific points.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and detailed summary in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"man,\" \"person,\" \"trees,\" and \"hedge.\"\n*   **Attribute Description:** It gives specific visual details for the main subject (light skin, short hair, brown jacket, blue jeans, backpack).\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It correctly prioritizes the main, moving subject (\"the young man\") before describing the secondary, static subject (\"a seated person\").\n*   **Avoiding Uncertainty:** It correctly uses \"appears to be\" when describing the action of the person on the bench, adhering to the rule of not describing what is uncertain.\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no Markdown.\n\n**Where the caption fails to follow instructions:**\n1.  **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses the word \"**serene**\" to describe the setting. \"Serene\" is a subjective term that describes a mood or feeling, not a visual fact.\n2.  **Unnecessary Background Description:** The instruction says, \"**Don't mention the background... unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.**\" While mentioning the \"snowy park\" is necessary context, the final sentence, \"The setting is serene, with snow covering the ground and the branches of the trees,\" describes the environment for its own sake rather than to distinguish a subject. The description of the path being \"lined with leafless trees and a hedge\" also falls into this category.\n3.  **Inclusion of Introductory Text:** The instruction states, \"**Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.**\" The caption begins with \"**The video features...**,\" which is a form of introductory text. The description should begin directly with the subject (e.g., \"A young man walks through a snowy park...\").\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is good because it is clear, detailed, and well-structured. However, to be considered a perfect caption according to the rules, it would need to be revised to remove the introductory phrase (\"The video features\"), the subjective adjective (\"serene\"), and the parts of the background description that do not directly help in identifying or distinguishing the subjects.",
