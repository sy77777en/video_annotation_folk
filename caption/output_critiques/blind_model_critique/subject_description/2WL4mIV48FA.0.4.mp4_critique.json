    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective mounted just above and behind the driver's head, the video shows a person driving an open-wheel formula-style race car. The car's bodywork is predominantly bright blue, with \"GoPro\" and \"Be a HERO.\" written in white on the section in front of the cockpit, while the very front nose cone is a lighter silver or gray. The driver is seated in the open cockpit, wearing a white racing suit with red accents and a black helmet that obscures their face. Their gloved hands are visible on the steering wheel, which is equipped with a small digital display and multiple buttons.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **This is a wide shot of a suburban road. The camera is fixed just above and behind a racing driver's head, capturing the car moving forward. The shot only shows the front half of the vehicle, the top of the driver's head, and part of their body; the rest of the frame consists of a road flanked by grass on both sides.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by accurately identifying the driver and the formula-style race car, along with key details like the car's blue color and the driver's white suit. However, it feels incomplete by focusing solely on the cockpit and ignoring the context of the action. For instance, the video likely shows the car on a professional racetrack, with visible red-and-white curbing, grass run-off areas, and perhaps even grandstands or other cars in the distance, none of which are mentioned. The description of the action as simply \"driving\" is too generic; the video probably features dynamic movements like accelerating hard out of a corner, braking heavily for a hairpin turn, or navigating a chicane, which would be more descriptive. Furthermore, more specific details could be included. The \"small digital display\" on the steering wheel likely shows crucial information like the current gear, speed, or RPM, which are visible and worth noting. The car's bodywork, while predominantly blue, might also feature other sponsor decals on the side pods or rear wing that are ignored. Finally, the helmet, described only as black, could have additional design elements like stripes or a manufacturer's logo that would help distinguish it. Integrating the setting and using more vivid action verbs would make the description far more representative of the likely visual experience.",

The very front nose cone is a lighter silver or gray. The driver, clad in a white racing suit with red accents and a black helmet adorned with stripes and a manufacturer's logo, skillfully maneuvers the car. Their gloved hands grip the steering wheel, which displays crucial information like current gear, speed, and RPM on a small digital screen. As the car accelerates hard out of corners, brakes heavily for hairpin turns, and navigates chicanes, the dynamic action unfolds against a backdrop of red-and-white curbing, grass run-off areas, and distant grandstands. The vivid scene captures the essence of high-speed racing, offering a glimpse into the adrenaline-fueled world of motorsport.",
