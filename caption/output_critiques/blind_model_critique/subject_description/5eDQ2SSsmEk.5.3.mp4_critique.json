    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up view of a red, textured surface resembling paper or fabric, with handwritten numbers prominently displayed. The numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" are visible, written in bold, black ink. The surface appears to be partially covered with a layer of frost or ice crystals, adding a glistening effect. The lighting casts a bluish tint over the scene, enhancing the contrast between the red background and the black writing. The focus is on the numbers and the icy texture, creating a visually striking composition.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the visual elements. It precisely identifies the main subject as a \"red, textured surface\" and the key details on it, which are the handwritten numbers \"87,000\" and \"90,000\" in \"bold, black ink.\" The description of the \"frost or ice crystals\" and the resulting \"glistening effect\" is specific and paints a clear picture. The mention of the \"bluish tint\" from the lighting is also a precise and important visual detail.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete for what appears to be a close-up, static shot. It covers all the essential visual information: the primary subject (the surface), its attributes (color, texture, covering), the secondary subjects (the numbers), their attributes (value, style, color), and the overall lighting of the scene. It successfully creates a comprehensive mental image of the video's content without needing more information.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres to many of the instructions but fails on a few key points.\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and packed with useful visual details.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It excels at describing visual attributes, using specific language like \"red, textured,\" \"bold, black ink,\" and \"frost or ice crystals.\"\n*   **No Frame References:** It correctly describes the scene holistically without mentioning \"first frame\" or \"last frame.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Naming:** It uses clear terms like \"surface\" and \"numbers\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Handles Ambiguity:** It correctly handles the ambiguity of the surface material by stating it \"resembling paper or fabric,\" which avoids making an unverified claim.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Use of Forbidden Terms:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", directly violating the instruction: \"avoid using terms like 'image' or 'frame'\" (and by extension, \"video\"). The description should start directly, for example: \"A close-up view shows a red, textured surface...\"\n*   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The caption ends with \"...creating a visually striking composition.\" The phrase \"visually striking\" is subjective and conveys an opinion, violating the rule to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\"\n*   **Introductory Text:** The phrase \"The video features...\" acts as introductory text, which is against the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\"",
