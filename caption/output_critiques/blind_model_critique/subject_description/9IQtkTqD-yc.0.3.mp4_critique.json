    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but contains a few violations of the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key visual elements: a point-of-view from a moving vehicle, a narrow and unpaved road, dense woods with bare trees, and the distinctive look of a night-vision lens (grainy, monochromatic green). The description of the single beam of light illuminating the path is also precise.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully recognizes that there is no single salient subject and correctly applies the specific instruction for scenery shots. It describes the overall environment and atmosphere, which is the focus of the video, and provides a justification for why a main subject is not described, fulfilling that part of the instructions perfectly.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres to most instructions well, but it fails on a few key points:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly identifies the video as a \"scenery shot\" and explains why, as instructed.\n    *   It provides a concise, single-paragraph description without using forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   It combines details from the video into a coherent, holistic description.\n    *   It uses specific and descriptive language for the visual attributes of the scene (e.g., \"grainy, monochromatic green glow,\" \"rough, unpaved path,\" \"bare trees\").\n\n*   **Violations:**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The most significant violation is the use of the word \"**eerie**.\" The instruction explicitly states, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" \"Eerie\" describes a feeling or emotion evoked by the scene, not a direct visual attribute. The word \"**isolated**\" is also borderline subjective, though it can be argued as a factual description of the remote location. A more objective word like \"remote\" would have been a safer choice.\n    *   **Introductory Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"**This is a scenery shot of...**\". While not a major error, the instructions ask for the description itself, without introductory text. A more direct and effective caption would start immediately with the description, such as: \"A vehicle travels down a narrow, wooded road at night...\"\n\nIn summary, the caption is very good at capturing the essence of the video accurately and completely. However, its use of the subjective adjective \"eerie\" is a clear violation of a core instruction.",
