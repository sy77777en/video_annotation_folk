    "pre_caption": "The video shows a dark-colored helicopter hovering in a dark, misty environment, with its landing skids visible. A bright spotlight shines down from the helicopter, illuminating a person standing directly below. The person is wearing light-colored clothing and appears to be looking upwards or holding an object that reflects the light. The scene is dimly lit, with the spotlight creating a strong contrast between the illuminated area and the surrounding darkness.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but has a few key areas where it fails to adhere strictly to the instructions.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is mostly accurate in describing the primary subjects and the overall scene. It correctly identifies a helicopter with a spotlight and a person below. The description of the lighting (dark, misty, strong contrast from the spotlight) is also accurate and relevant. However, the phrase \"appears to be looking upwards or holding an object that reflects the light\" is speculative. The instruction explicitly states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" While the caption uses \"appears to be\" to soften the claim, it still presents an interpretation rather than a direct observation. A more compliant description would state only what is visible, such as \"a bright point of light is visible on the person's upper body.\"\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is quite complete, successfully capturing the most salient elements of the scene. It describes the two main subjects (helicopter, person), their key visual attributes (dark-colored, light-colored clothing), their relationship (one hovering above the other), and the crucial element connecting them (the spotlight). It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet effectively conveys the essential information.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the helicopter and the person as the main subjects.\n*   **Simple Language:** The caption uses clear, natural English.\n*   **One Paragraph:** It is formatted as a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **No Subjective Adjectives:** It avoids emotional language, using descriptive words like \"bright\" and \"strong\" in an objective context.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"helicopter,\" \"person\").\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   **Use of Meta-Language:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\", which violates the instruction to describe the scene directly without referring to the medium itself (e.g., \"video,\" \"image,\" \"frame\"). The description should start as if the reader is looking at the scene, for example: \"A dark-colored helicopter hovers...\"\n*   **Inclusion of Speculation:** As mentioned under \"Accuracy,\" describing what the person \"appears to be\" doing is a violation of the rule against describing things you are unsure about.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good and captures the essence of the video well, but it is not perfect. To be fully compliant with the instructions, it should be revised to remove the introductory phrase \"The video shows...\" and rephrase the speculative statement about the person's action into a purely objective observation.",
