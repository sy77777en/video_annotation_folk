To the left, a serene, dark-water lake is nestled at the base of the mountains, while in the distance, a majestic range of jagged, snow-capped peaks rises against a deep blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The video lacks a single main subject, as the sweeping camera motion and wide-angle view are intended to immerse the viewer in the vast scale and breathtaking beauty of the alpine environment itself. The focus is on the grandeur of the natural world rather than any specific object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is **not good** because it violates several key instructions, particularly regarding objectivity, conciseness, and the description of motion and intent.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is generally accurate in its description of the visual elements. It correctly identifies the golden-brown grassy ridge, the dark-water lake, the snow-capped peaks, and the blue sky with clouds. The spatial relationships (lake to the left, peaks in the distance) are also correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in that it covers all the major components of the landscape scene. No significant visual elements are omitted.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Violation 1: Use of Subjective Adjectives:** The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption is filled with them, such as \"**dramatic**,\" \"**serene**,\" \"**majestic**,\" \"**breathtaking** beauty,\" and \"**grandeur**.\" These words describe the writer's emotional reaction rather than objective visual facts.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Describing Motion and Camera Work:** The instructions state, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The caption heavily describes the camera's movement (\"**fast-moving** aerial perspective,\" \"**flying low**,\" \"**sweeping camera motion**\"). This describes the cinematography, not the subjects themselves, and is not necessary to distinguish the landscape elements.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Speculation and Describing Intent:** The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The caption speculates on the filmmaker's purpose: \"...are **intended to immerse the viewer**...\" and \"**The focus is on** the grandeur of the natural world...\" This is an interpretation of intent, not a description of what is visually present.\n\n*   **Violation 4: Introductory Text:** The instructions require returning \"only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown or introductory text.\" The caption begins with \"**This is a...**,\" which is unnecessary introductory phrasing.\n\n*   **Violation 5: Overly Explanatory Tone:** The special instruction for scenery shots allows for a brief explanation (1-3 sentences) of why there is no main subject. However, the caption's final two sentences are overly long, analytical, and violate other rules (subjectivity, speculation) in the process. The explanation should be concise and objective.\n\n### Corrected Example\nFor comparison, here is a caption that adheres to all the given instructions:\n\nFrom an aerial perspective, a steep, golden-brown grassy ridge is in the foreground. To the left of the ridge is a dark-water lake at the base of mountains. In the distance, a range of jagged, snow-capped peaks stands against a deep blue sky with scattered white clouds. The video is a landscape scenery shot, with the focus on the overall environment rather than a single subject.",
