    "pre_caption": "This is a dramatic landscape scenery shot captured from a fast-moving aerial perspective, flying low along the spine of a steep, golden-brown grassy ridge. To the left, a serene, dark-water lake is nestled at the base of the mountains, while in the distance, a majestic range of jagged, snow-capped peaks rises against a deep blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. The video lacks a single main subject, as the sweeping camera motion and wide-angle view are intended to immerse the viewer in the vast scale and breathtaking beauty of the alpine environment itself. The focus is on the grandeur of the natural world rather than any specific object within it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies this as a fast-moving aerial landscape shot and outlines the primary geographical elements, it misses several key visual details and relies on subjective language. The description of the ridge as simply \"golden-brown\" is an oversimplification; the video clearly shows significant patches of dark green moss and deep, shadowed crevices that give it a more complex and rugged texture. Furthermore, labeling the lake \"serene\" is inaccurate, as the low, fast-moving perspective creates a visible wind shear on the water's surface, causing distinct ripples that contradict a state of serenity. The caption also fails to mention the prominent, warm-toned lens flare that briefly washes over the view as the camera banks, a significant visual effect of the low sun angle. Lastly, the use of subjective adjectives like \"dramatic,\" \"majestic,\" and \"breathtaking\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional descriptors; instead, the caption should objectively describe the high-contrast lighting and the vast scale difference between the foreground ridge and the distant peaks to convey this sense of grandeur.",
