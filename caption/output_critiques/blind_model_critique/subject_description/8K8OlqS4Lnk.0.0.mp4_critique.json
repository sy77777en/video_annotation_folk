Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully identifies the video type and its main components, but it fails on one key instruction regarding objectivity.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies the video as a \"landscape scenery shot.\"\n*   It correctly lists the key visual elements: a rainbow, a cloudy sky, green trees, a street scene, power lines, and a distant mountain. This suggests the description is a faithful representation of the video's content.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is complete according to the specific instructions for scenery shots. It correctly states that there is no main subject and explains why: \"The focus is on the... atmospheric conditions... rather than any specific object.\"\n*   It includes enough detail to give a clear picture of the scene's scale and composition.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Strengths (What the caption does well):**\n    *   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or introductory text.\n    *   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and gets straight to the point.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids using words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n    *   **Holistic View:** It describes the scene as a whole, not as a sequence of frames.\n    *   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses clear and precise terms like \"rainbow,\" \"trees,\" and \"power lines.\"\n    *   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly follows the rule for describing a scenery shot by explaining the lack of a main subject.\n\n*   **Weaknesses (Where the caption fails):**\n    *   **Use of Subjective Adjectives:** This is the most significant violation of the instructions. The rules state, \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.**\" The caption uses several:\n        *   \"**vibrant** rainbow\"\n        *   \"**lush** green trees\"\n        *   \"natural **beauty**\"\n        *   \"**serene** environment\"\n        *   \"**enhancing** the overall ambiance\"\n        These words interpret the scene's mood and quality rather than just describing its visual facts. A more compliant caption would use neutral descriptors (e.g., \"a multi-colored rainbow,\" \"dense green trees\").\n\n    *   **Sentence Count:** The instruction for scenery shots suggests a length of \"one to three sentences.\" The provided caption is four sentences long. While a minor deviation, a more concise version would be better aligned with the guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is a landscape scenery shot featuring a multi-colored rainbow arcing across a cloudy sky, with dense green trees and a street scene below. The focus is on the atmospheric conditions, highlighting the rainbow's colors and the environment without emphasizing any specific object. Power lines and a distant mountain contribute to the sense of scale and depth.",
