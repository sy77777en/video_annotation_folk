    "pre_caption": "The video features several stylized claymation figures with exaggerated facial features and elongated heads. The most prominent subject is a woman with pale skin, short brown hair with bangs, and a maroon beaded necklace, wearing a dark blue dress with a diamond pattern; she holds a small plate of food and has a serious expression. A man with light skin, short brown hair, and a somber face, dressed in a black suit and white shirt, stands beside her, also holding a plate of food. In the background, another woman with short dark hair and a dark dress is seen reading, while an older man with a bald head and gray hair on the sides, wearing a green suit, sits further back. A framed portrait of a man with a long face and blue shirt, along with a vase of white flowers and a small plate with a slice of cake and a candle, are placed on a table, suggesting a commemorative setting. The characters’ faces are marked by visible brushstrokes and blush, giving them a handcrafted, textured appearance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\n### Evaluation Breakdown:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"stylized claymation figures\" and provides precise, verifiable details about their appearance, such as the woman's \"maroon beaded necklace\" and \"dark blue dress with a diamond pattern,\" and the older man's \"bald head and gray hair on the sides.\" The description of the overall artistic style, including \"exaggerated facial features,\" \"elongated heads,\" and \"visible brushstrokes,\" is a key detail that accurately captures the video's aesthetic.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It successfully describes the scene holistically by:\n    *   Identifying and detailing the two primary subjects in the foreground.\n    *   Mentioning the secondary subjects in the background with appropriate brevity.\n    *   Including important objects (the portrait, vase, and cake with a candle) that add context to the scene.\n    *   Concluding with a summary of the overall texture and artistic medium, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the subjects.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions almost perfectly.\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph packed with essential information. While long, its length is justified by the level of detail required by the instructions for a complex scene.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes, avoiding unnecessary details about the background.\n    *   **Proper Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids meta-terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It correctly uses precise subject types like \"woman,\" \"man,\" and \"claymation figures.\"\n    *   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional adjectives and instead describes expressions factually (\"serious expression,\" \"somber face\").\n    *   **Structure and Order:** The subjects are described in a logical order, starting with a general overview, then the most prominent figures, followed by background characters and key objects. This follows the prioritization rule perfectly.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the multiple figures using location (\"beside her,\" \"in the background\") and appearance (\"older man\").\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement:\n\nThe phrase \"**suggesting a commemorative setting**\" is a slight deviation from the instruction to \"avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" This is an interpretation of the scene's meaning rather than a direct description of visual facts. While it is a very logical inference, a stricter adherence would involve simply describing the objects without assigning a purpose. However, this is a very minor point in an otherwise outstanding caption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the instructions by providing a detailed, accurate, and well-organized description that allows a reader to clearly visualize the subjects in the video.",
