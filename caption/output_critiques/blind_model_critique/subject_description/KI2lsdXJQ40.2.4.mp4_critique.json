    "pre_caption": "The video features several stylized claymation figures with exaggerated facial features and elongated heads. The most prominent subject is a woman with pale skin, short brown hair with bangs, and a maroon beaded necklace, wearing a dark blue dress with a diamond pattern; she holds a small plate of food and has a serious expression. A man with light skin, short brown hair, and a somber face, dressed in a black suit and white shirt, stands beside her, also holding a plate of food. In the background, another woman with short dark hair and a dark dress is seen reading, while an older man with a bald head and gray hair on the sides, wearing a green suit, sits further back. A framed portrait of a man with a long face and blue shirt, along with a vase of white flowers and a small plate with a slice of cake and a candle, are placed on a table, suggesting a commemorative setting. The characters’ faces are marked by visible brushstrokes and blush, giving them a handcrafted, textured appearance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the stylized appearance of the claymation figures and the main sequence of events, it misses some key interactive and environmental details that would enrich the description. For instance, the \"two small plates of food\" are not described; specifying if they hold something like small, gray-colored canapés would add to the somber, commemorative tone. The description of the man in the black suit merely states he \"accepts\" the plate, but it omits his subtle reaction, such as a slight, hesitant nod and how his gaze briefly drops to the plate before returning to the woman. Furthermore, the action where the woman \"takes the small plate with the slice of cake\" is ambiguous; the video shows her deliberately picking it up from the table and presenting it towards the man, implying it is an offering for him, which is a crucial narrative beat. The description of the camera movement as a \"shift\" is also too general; a more precise term like \"slow pan to the left\" would better describe how the man in the green suit is reframed. Finally, the caption fails to note a significant detail about the portrait: the man depicted bears a strong resemblance to the man in the black suit, suggesting it might be a portrait of a deceased father or brother, which solidifies the funereal or memorial atmosphere far more strongly than the general \"commemorative setting\" suggestion.",
