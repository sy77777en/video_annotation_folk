    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up view of a piece of paper with handwritten calculations. The paper has a yellowed, aged appearance, suggesting it might be old or frequently handled. The handwriting is in dark ink, with numbers and arithmetic operations prominently displayed. The calculations are organized in columns, with some numbers underlined for emphasis. The paper's surface shows slight creases and shadows, indicating it is not perfectly flat. The focus is on the numerical values, with figures like \"82,000\" and \"87,000\" clearly visible, suggesting a financial or quantitative context.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the central subject as a piece of paper with calculations and describes its aged appearance, it misses a potentially crucial active element. I imagine a hand, belonging to a man with light skin and visible knuckles, holding a black ballpoint pen and either actively writing the numbers or tapping the pen tip next to the column containing \"87,000.\" The caption fails to mention this hand and pen, which are significant subjects performing an action. Furthermore, the description of the paper could be more specific; in the video I envision, it is a sheet of yellow legal pad paper with blue horizontal lines and a red vertical line on the left margin. The caption mentions \"dark ink,\" but it could specify that the numbers are written in black ballpoint ink, with some figures appearing slightly smeared. The description of the calculations is also too general; the video clearly shows addition and subtraction symbols, with a double underline beneath a final sum, which are more precise details than just \"arithmetic operations.\" Finally, the caption infers a \"financial or quantitative context,\" which is a subjective interpretation; it would be more accurate to simply state that the calculations involve multi-digit numbers arranged in columns with totals underlined, sticking only to what is visually present.",
