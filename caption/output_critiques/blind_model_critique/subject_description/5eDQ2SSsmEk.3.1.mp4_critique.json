    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"piece of paper with handwritten calculations.\" The descriptions of its visual attributes—such as its \"yellowed, aged appearance,\" \"dark ink,\" \"columns,\" \"underlined\" numbers, and \"slight creases\"—are all precise and factually correct based on the visual information. The mention of specific figures like \"82,000\" and \"87,000\" further enhances its accuracy.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the salient details of the subject in a holistic manner. It describes the paper's condition, the nature of the handwriting, the organization of the content, and even the texture of the surface. It provides a comprehensive overview without needing to reference specific moments or frames.\n\n**Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThe caption fails to adhere to several key instructions:\n\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", directly violating the rule that forbids using terms like \"video.\"\n*   **Speculation:** The caption includes speculative phrases like \"suggesting it might be old or frequently handled\" and \"suggesting a financial or quantitative context.\" The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" These phrases are interpretations of the visual evidence, not direct descriptions of it.\n*   **Conciseness:** While informative, the inclusion of speculative phrases makes the caption less concise than it could be.\n\nOn the other hand, the caption successfully follows other instructions:\n*   It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   It uses simple, natural English.\n*   It correctly identifies the subject type (\"piece of paper\").\n*   It provides detailed descriptions of visual attributes.\n*   It avoids subjective emotional adjectives.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is good in terms of its descriptive accuracy and completeness, providing a clear and detailed picture of the video's content. However, it is **not a good caption** because it fails to follow critical negative constraints in the instructions, specifically by using the forbidden word \"video\" and including speculative interpretations.",
