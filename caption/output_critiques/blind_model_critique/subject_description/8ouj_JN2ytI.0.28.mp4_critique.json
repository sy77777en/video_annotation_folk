    "pre_caption": "The main focus is a football player wearing a black helmet adorned with a yellow logo, a yellow jersey with black accents and a number, black pants, and white shoes. This player is running forward, carrying a brown football. Directly behind him, a large, dense cloud of brown dust and debris erupts upwards from the green football field. Another football player, distinguished by a blue helmet and a blue and white uniform, is kneeling on the grass to the right and slightly ahead of the main player. Additional football players are present on the field: some, also in blue and white uniforms, are running in the midground and background, while at least one other player in a yellow and black uniform is visible further back.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the key players and the central action, but it could be enhanced with greater specificity and a more dynamic description of the events. For instance, the \"light yellowish-white logo\" on the helmet is vague; if the video shows a clear image, describing the logo's actual shape (e.g., \"a stylized hornet\" or \"a lightning bolt\") would be more precise. Similarly, the player's jersey number is a critical identifier and should be included if visible. The description of the \"cloud of brown dust and debris\" could be more accurate; on a modern field, this is likely a spray of black rubber turf pellets, and specifying this would add realism. The caption also describes the events sequentially rather than as an interconnected play; it would be more impactful to link the main player's forward motion to the second player's fall, framing it as the aftermath of a broken tackle that caused the turf to erupt. Lastly, the description of the football as \"deep red\" is unusual, as they are typically brown; if the color is standard, \"a brown leather football\" would be more accurate, but if it is indeed red, this unique detail should be emphasized as a notable feature.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A football player, wearing a black helmet with a stylized hornet logo, a yellow jersey with black accents and the number 23, black pants, and white shoes, charges forward with a brown leather football in hand. As he breaks through a tackle, a spray of black rubber turf pellets erupts from the green field behind him. To his right, a player in a blue helmet and blue and white uniform is kneeling on the grass, having just missed the tackle. Other players in blue and white uniforms are seen running in the midground and background, while another player in a yellow and black uniform is visible further back, all contributing to the dynamic scene on the field.",
