    "pre_caption": "This first-person perspective video features a person wearing a camouflage-patterned hat and jacket in shades of brown, tan, and dark green. The person holds a semi-automatic shotgun, which is also covered in a matching camouflage pattern. Initially, the gun is held low, and the person's head and shoulder are visible. The shotgun is then raised into an aiming position, causing the person's upper body to move out of the frame. The view then focuses on the long barrel of the shotgun and a light-skinned hand gripping its fore-end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **In this video, the camera is mounted on a gun. At the beginning, both the gun barrel and the upper body of a person are visible. Then, as the gun is raised and aimed forward, the person moves out of the frame, leaving only the hand holding the gun, the gun barrel, and a field landscape in view.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good, sterile description of the subject and action, but it misses key contextual and specific details that are apparent in the video. The description of a \"fixed camera view\" is inaccurate; the perspective is clearly from a camera mounted on the shotgun itself, creating a first-person point-of-view that follows the barrel's movement, which is why the person's head is never fully in the shot. While the camouflage is noted, the setting is clearly a dense, autumnal forest with brown leaves on the ground, and a brief mention of this would provide important context. The description of the person could be more detailed; they are wearing large, black hearing protectors over their hat and amber-lensed shooting glasses, which are prominent features. Furthermore, the description of the hand is incomplete; the left hand gripping the fore-end is bare, but the right hand, which is briefly visible near the trigger area, is wearing a black, fingerless glove. Finally, the action of aiming could be more specific: as the gun is raised, the view is clearly focused down the shotgun's ventilated rib toward a bright red fiber-optic front sight, and the person's thumb can be seen deliberately flicking the safety off before their finger settles on the trigger guard.",
