    "pre_caption": "In a video game with a stylized, top-down view, two cartoonish chef characters are visible. One is a small figure with white hair and a prominent white mustache, wearing a red long-sleeved shirt, blue pants, and a classic white chef's hat. The other character, similar in build, also has white hair and a chef's hat but is clean-shaven and wears a blue long-sleeved shirt with red pants.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as \"cartoonish chef characters\" and precisely describes their distinct visual attributes, such as clothing color, hairstyle, and the presence or absence of a mustache.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is comprehensive. It provides enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of both subjects. It includes context (\"video game with a stylized, top-down view\") which is essential for understanding the nature of the subjects and the scene, without dwelling on the background.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is brief yet packed with all the necessary information about the subjects.\n    *   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the two chefs, their types, and their visual attributes, as instructed.\n    *   **Proper Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It also correctly avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n    *   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It does an excellent job of distinguishing between the two similar subjects by highlighting their key differences (mustache vs. clean-shaven, red shirt vs. blue shirt).\n    *   **Formatting:** The output is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, exactly as required.\n    *   **No Speculation:** The description is based purely on visible attributes and does not make any assumptions.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is clear, descriptive, and formatted correctly, successfully capturing the essential visual information of the video's subjects.",
