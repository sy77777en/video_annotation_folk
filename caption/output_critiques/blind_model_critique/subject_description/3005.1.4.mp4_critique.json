    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a young man with short, dark hair and a light complexion, who appears to be of East Asian descent, standing on an indoor basketball court. He wears a dark blue and white sleeveless jersey and is holding a basketball. Several other players are on the court around him. To his right, another player is seen from the back, wearing a dark blue jersey with the white number \"2\". In the background, other players in white jerseys are visible, one with the number \"13\" and another with the number \"12\". A basketball hoop with a white backboard is visible in the upper left corner.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the main subject and other players, but it describes the scene in a static manner that doesn't capture the motion in the video. For example, it states the young man is \"standing,\" but in the video, he is rhythmically dribbling the basketball between his legs while scanning the court, suggesting he is actively engaged in a drill or play. The description of the player in the number \"2\" jersey is accurate, but it omits that he is jogging in place, not just standing. Furthermore, the caption mentions players warming up but fails to describe their specific actions; the players with only their legs visible are performing high-knee exercises in the foreground, and the players in white jerseys are not just \"visible\" but are actively passing a ball back and forth in the background. The description of the hoop and auditorium is a bit disconnected; a more integrated description would note that the main player is facing the hoop, establishing a clear sense of direction and intent. The overall description could be improved by using more dynamic verbs and connecting the subjects through their shared activity to better convey the atmosphere of a live basketball practice.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The main subject is a young man with short, dark hair and a light complexion, likely of East Asian descent, actively dribbling a basketball between his legs while scanning the court on an indoor basketball court. He wears a dark blue and white sleeveless jersey, fully engaged in a drill or play. To his right, another player in a dark blue jersey with the white number \"2\" is jogging in place, ready to spring into action. In the foreground, players are performing high-knee exercises, adding to the dynamic energy of the scene. In the background, players in white jerseys, numbered \"13\" and \"12,\" are actively passing a ball back and forth, contributing to the lively practice atmosphere. The young man is facing the basketball hoop with a white backboard in the upper left corner, establishing a clear sense of direction and intent as he participates in the practice session.",
