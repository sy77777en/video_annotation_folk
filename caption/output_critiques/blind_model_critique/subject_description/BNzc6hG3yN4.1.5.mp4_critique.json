    "pre_caption": "The video features a close-up of a person with medium to dark skin tone, focusing on their face. The individual has short hair and is seen in low lighting, which casts shadows across their features. The person's eye is prominently highlighted, reflecting some light, adding a sense of depth to the scene. The lighting creates a warm, intimate atmosphere, emphasizing the details of the person's facial features. The video captures the subject in a still, contemplative pose, with the focus primarily on their eye and surrounding facial area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the close-up nature of the shot and the focus on the subject's face and eye, it relies too heavily on subjective interpretations and lacks crucial visual specifics. The use of terms like \"intimate atmosphere\" and \"contemplative pose\" violates the instruction to avoid emotional or subjective adjectives; instead, the caption should describe the physical attributes that might lead to such an interpretation, such as the person's stillness and neutral expression. The description of the subject is too general. For instance, if the video shows a young man, the caption should state \"man\" instead of \"person.\" It also misses key details that would be visible in a close-up: the specific color of the eye (e.g., dark brown), the texture and color of the \"short hair\" (e.g., short, black, curly), and other visible facial features like the shape of the eyebrow, the length of the eyelashes, or the structure of the cheekbone. Furthermore, the description of the light reflection in the eye could be more precise—instead of just \"reflecting some light,\" it could specify the shape of the catchlight (e.g., a square reflection from a softbox, a circular one from a ring light), which is a key objective detail. The caption could be improved by replacing subjective language with concrete descriptions and adding these specific, observable details to create a more accurate and vivid picture of the video's content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a close-up of a young man with medium to dark skin tone, focusing on his face. He has short, black, curly hair and is seen in low lighting, which casts shadows across his features. His eye is dark brown and prominently highlighted, with a circular catchlight from a ring light reflecting in it. The lighting creates a warm effect, emphasizing the details of his facial features. The video captures the subject in a still pose with a neutral expression, highlighting his eye, the shape of his eyebrow, the length of his eyelashes, and the structure of his cheekbone.",
