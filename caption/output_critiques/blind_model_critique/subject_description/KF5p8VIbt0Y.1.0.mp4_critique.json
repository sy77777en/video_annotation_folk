    "pre_caption": "A white man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a dark suit and white shirt, hangs from the minute hand of a large, round clock face protruding from the side of a brick building. The scene initially appears to be set high above a bustling city street filled with early-model cars and pedestrians. The perspective then changes to reveal that the building facade is a partial set constructed on the rooftop of another building. A mattress is placed on the roof floor beneath the man, and a vintage film camera on a tripod is visible, positioned to film the stunt, creating a forced perspective that makes the man appear to be at a much greater height.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption that perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instruction. It is a model example of how to apply the rules to a complex video that involves a change in perspective.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a man hanging from a clock on a brick building. Crucially, it accurately describes the central point of the video: the reveal of the filmmaking trick. It correctly notes that the initial scene is a forced perspective illusion and then accurately describes the elements that prove this: the partial set, the rooftop location, the safety mattress, and the film camera.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete. It doesn't just describe the first part of the video (the stunt) but synthesizes the entire sequence into a coherent narrative. It includes all salient subjects:\n*   **The man:** His appearance and action are detailed.\n*   **The clock and building:** Described as the setting for the stunt.\n*   **The \"background\":** The city street, cars, and pedestrians are mentioned to establish the initial illusion.\n*   **The reveal elements:** The partial set, the rooftop, the mattress, and the camera are all included, as they are essential to understanding the full context.\n\nBy describing both the illusion and the reality behind it, the caption provides a complete and comprehensive summary of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption follows every rule meticulously:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, well-written paragraph without being wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered on the subjects (man, clock, camera, etc.) and their attributes.\n*   **Combined Details:** It masterfully combines the initial scene with the later reveal into one cohesive description, rather than describing them as separate, disconnected frames.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n*   **Justified Background Description:** It mentions the \"bustling city street\" and the \"rooftop,\" which is necessary to explain the core concept of the forced perspective illusion and its subsequent reveal. This is a perfect use of the exception to the \"no background\" rule.\n*   **No Speculation:** It describes what is visually present. Stating that the camera is \"positioned to film the stunt\" and that the setup is \"creating a forced perspective\" are direct, logical inferences from the visual evidence, not subjective speculation.\n*   **Simple, Natural English:** The language is clear, professional, and easy to understand.\n*   **Single Coherent Paragraph:** The caption is a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive adjectives (\"dark,\" \"white,\" \"round,\" \"brick\") rather than subjective or emotional ones.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific visual details for the man (\"white man with dark hair and glasses, wearing a dark suit and white shirt\") and the key objects (\"large, round clock face,\" \"vintage film camera on a tripod\").\n*   **Handles Transitions Perfectly:** The sentence \"The perspective then changes to reveal...\" is the ideal way to describe the shift in the video that exposes the filmmaking technique, fully adhering to the instruction to describe how subjects change or are revealed.\n\nIn conclusion, the caption is of outstanding quality. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the instructions by not just listing objects, but by using the descriptive rules to tell the visual story of the scene—the illusion and its deconstruction.",
