    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a crowded football stadium during a game. The stands are packed with numerous spectators, predominantly dressed in purple and yellow. On the vibrant green field, marked with white yard lines and a large purple \"N\" logo at the center, football players in white uniforms and helmets are positioned for a play. Another group of players in similar white uniforms stands along the sideline. As the camera pans to the right, a few spectators in the foreground become more prominent. We see the back of a person's head with short brown hair, wearing a red visor. To their right, a man with short, graying hair is seen in profile, wearing a green baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt, looking out at the field. Partially visible behind him is a woman with long blonde hair.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows an open-air stadium during a game, with the stands filled with spectators. The camera is positioned in the stand, initially showing the field and the stands opposite. It then pans to the right, showing some people in the foreground at the frame's right corner, along with parts of the field and distant stands.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres almost perfectly to the given instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the scene shown in a typical video of a football game from the stands. It correctly identifies:\n*   The setting as a \"crowded football stadium.\"\n*   The subjects as \"spectators\" and \"football players.\"\n*   Key visual details like the spectators' colors (\"purple and yellow\"), the field's appearance (\"vibrant green,\" \"white yard lines,\" \"purple 'N' logo\"), and the players' uniforms (\"white uniforms and helmets\").\n*   The specific details of the foreground subjects that become visible, such as the \"person... wearing a red visor\" and the \"man with short, graying hair... wearing a green baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive. It starts with a wide, general view and logically narrows its focus as the camera action is described.\n*   It captures the overall atmosphere by mentioning the \"crowded\" stands.\n*   It describes the subjects on the field and on the sideline.\n*   It effectively details the foreground subjects that become the focus later in the video, providing specific attributes for each.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the rules exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a lot of detail into a single, coherent paragraph without being overly wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered on the subjects (spectators, players, field).\n*   **Precise Language:** It uses specific terms like \"football stadium,\" \"spectators,\" \"man,\" and \"woman\" instead of vague words.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides excellent visual details for people (hair color, clothing, accessories) and objects (field markings, logo).\n*   **Holistic View:** It synthesizes the entire video's action into one narrative, correctly describing the camera pan and its effect on the scene without mentioning \"frames.\"\n*   **No Speculation or Subjectivity:** The language is objective and factual (e.g., \"partially visible,\" \"seen in profile\"). It avoids emotional or interpretive words.\n*   **Logical Order:** The description follows a logical flow, starting with the broad scene and then moving to the specific subjects in the foreground as they are revealed by the camera's movement.\n*   **Correct Format:** It is a single paragraph with no Markdown or unnecessary introductory text.\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement\n*   The opening phrase \"This video presents...\" is slightly introductory. While it doesn't violate the spirit of the instructions, a more direct start like \"A wide shot of a crowded football stadium...\" would be even more in line with the goal of providing only the description itself.\n\n**Overall, the caption is of very high quality. It demonstrates a strong understanding of all the detailed requirements and successfully translates a dynamic video scene into a clear, accurate, and objective text description.**",
