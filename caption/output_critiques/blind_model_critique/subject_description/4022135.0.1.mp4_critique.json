    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide shot of a crowded football stadium during a game. The stands are packed with numerous spectators, predominantly dressed in purple and yellow. On the vibrant green field, marked with white yard lines and a large purple \"N\" logo at the center, football players in white uniforms and helmets are positioned for a play. Another group of players in similar white uniforms stands along the sideline. As the camera pans to the right, a few spectators in the foreground become more prominent. We see the back of a person's head with short brown hair, wearing a red visor. To their right, a man with short, graying hair is seen in profile, wearing a green baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt, looking out at the field. Partially visible behind him is a woman with long blonde hair.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows an open-air stadium during a game, with the stands filled with spectators. The camera is positioned in the stand, initially showing the field and the stands opposite. It then pans to the right, showing some people in the foreground at the frame's right corner, along with parts of the field and distant stands.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by establishing the setting and identifying the key subjects, but it misses crucial details that would be present in a video of a football game. The description of the players is incomplete; while it mentions the team in white uniforms, it fails to describe the opposing team on the field, which would presumably be wearing the home colors of purple and yellow. A football game involves two teams, and describing only one leaves a significant gap in the visual narrative. Furthermore, the description is very static, stating the players are \"positioned for a play\" without mentioning any of the subsequent action, such as the snap, the quarterback dropping back, or the movement of the players, which would almost certainly occur in a video. The description of the foreground spectators could also be enhanced. While the man in the gray sweatshirt is well-described, the \"person's head with short brown hair\" is vague, and the \"woman with long blonde hair\" is noted as only \"partially visible\" without specifying what parts are seen or if she is wearing team apparel. To improve, the caption should describe both teams on the field to provide full context, incorporate the dynamic action of the play unfolding, and offer more specific details about the foreground spectators, such as their reactions to the game or more descriptive features, to create a more complete and accurate representation of the imagined video content.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures an exhilarating scene at a packed football stadium during a game. The stands are filled with enthusiastic spectators, predominantly dressed in the home team's colors of purple and yellow. On the vibrant green field, marked with white yard lines and a large purple \"N\" logo at the center, two teams are ready for action. The home team, wearing purple and yellow uniforms, faces off against the visiting team in white uniforms and helmets. As the play unfolds, the quarterback in purple receives the snap and drops back, scanning the field for an open receiver, while players from both teams move dynamically across the field. Along the sideline, another group of players in white uniforms watches intently. In the foreground, the camera captures the back of a person's head with short brown hair, wearing a red visor, who is cheering energetically. To their right, a man with short, graying hair, wearing a green baseball cap and a gray hooded sweatshirt, watches the game with focused intensity. Partially visible behind him is a woman with long blonde hair, wearing a purple and yellow scarf, clapping and showing her support for the home team. The scene is alive with the energy and excitement of the game, capturing the essence of a thrilling football match.",
