    "pre_caption": "The video features a man with light brown skin as the main subject. He is wearing a black short-sleeved t-shirt with a small graphic on the chest, light blue jeans held up by a black belt, and white high-top sneakers. He accessorizes with a silver chain necklace and a red baseball cap worn backward, which has a white logo on the front. A blue jacket is tucked into the back of his jeans. Throughout the video, he is seen getting up from a bench, skateboarding on a city sidewalk, and jumping down a small set of stairs on his skateboard. He is also shown standing near a black SUV.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video has a **main subject with dynamic size**, so the description should focus on them. Don't mention the background scene and other motion.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject and his attire, it misses several key details that would be prominent in a skateboarding video. The skateboard itself, a central object, is not described at all; details such as the color of the deck, any graphics on its underside, or the color of the wheels are missing. The description of the man could be enhanced by including an estimated age, such as 'a young man,' and mentioning his hairstyle if visible. Furthermore, the caption lists a series of actions as a continuous narrative, but a skate video typically consists of a montage with hard cuts between different tricks and locations. The description should reflect this structure, noting the transitions between scenes—for instance, from the bench trick to the sidewalk line, and then to the stair jump. The actions themselves could be described more vividly; for example, 'jumping down a small set of stairs' could be 'ollieing down a three-stair set.' Finally, the mention of the 'black SUV' feels isolated; it would be more effective to describe the overall urban environment, such as noting if he is weaving through light traffic or past parked cars, to provide better context for his actions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a young man with light brown skin as the main subject. He sports a black short-sleeved t-shirt with a small graphic on the chest, light blue jeans held up by a black belt, and white high-top sneakers. His look is completed with a silver chain necklace and a red baseball cap worn backward, featuring a white logo on the front. A blue jacket is tucked into the back of his jeans. His skateboard, a key element in the video, has a vibrant red deck with a striking graphic on the underside and white wheels. The video is a dynamic montage, capturing him in various skateboarding scenes. It begins with him getting up from a bench, transitioning to a sequence where he skillfully weaves through light city traffic on the sidewalk. The action intensifies as he performs an ollie down a three-stair set. The urban backdrop includes parked cars and a black SUV, adding to the bustling city atmosphere. His hairstyle, a short and neat cut, is visible under the cap, enhancing his youthful appearance.",
