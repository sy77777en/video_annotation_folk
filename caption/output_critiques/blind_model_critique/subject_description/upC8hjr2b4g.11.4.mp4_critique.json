    "pre_caption": "The video features a mannequin-like figure seated on a chair in a dimly lit room. The figure has a smooth, white surface with geometric contours, resembling a stylized human form. It is positioned facing slightly to the right, with its hands resting on its lap. The figure is dressed in a two-toned outfit, combining dark and light shades that accentuate its angular design. The room contains a wooden table in the background, and a large cabinet with a reflective surface, adding depth to the scene. The lighting creates stark contrasts, highlighting the figure's distinct features and the minimalist setting.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation but misses several key visual details that define the video's aesthetic. While it correctly identifies the subject as a \"mannequin-like figure,\" the video reveals it to be a more abstract, androgynous sculpture with a matte, unpolished ceramic texture, not a smooth, generic surface. The description of the \"two-toned outfit\" is too vague; the figure is actually wearing a single, form-fitting garment that is starkly divided vertically, with the left half being matte black and the right half being the same white as the body, creating a striking visual asymmetry. The \"chair\" is not a conventional one but a simple, black metallic cube that reinforces the scene's geometric and minimalist theme. Furthermore, the caption omits the crucial element of camera movement; the video consists of a single, slow, continuous orbital pan from left to right, which gradually reveals the sculpture's different facets and the interplay of light upon them. The \"dimly lit room\" is more specifically lit by a single, harsh spotlight from above, which carves the figure out of the darkness with sharp highlights and long, dramatic shadows on its angular planes, an essential detail that is more descriptive than just \"dimly lit.\"",
