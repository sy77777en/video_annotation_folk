    "pre_caption": "The video features three brown horses with saddles, standing on a grassy and rocky terrain. The main subject is the horse in the foreground, which is grazing with its head lowered. It has a dark brown coat and a black mane, and the saddle is prominently visible. Behind it, two other horses are standing; one is slightly to the left and the other to the right. Both have similar saddles and are facing different directions, adding depth to the scene. The horses are positioned in a natural setting with a mountainous backdrop, emphasizing their presence in the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption correctly identifies the three horses and their primary actions, but it could be improved by removing subjective interpretations and adding more specific visual details. Phrases like \"adding depth to the scene\" and \"emphasizing their presence in the landscape\" are interpretive and should be omitted. Similarly, the mention of the \"mountainous backdrop\" violates the instruction to avoid describing the background. The description of the horses themselves could be more precise; for instance, instead of just \"brown horses,\" you could specify their shades, such as a \"dark bay horse in the foreground, a lighter chestnut horse to the left, and another bay to the right.\" The description of the tack is also vague; details like \"brown leather Western saddles\" or \"a visible red and white saddle blanket\" would be more informative. Finally, the orientation of the two background horses could be more clearly defined, for example, \"the horse on the left stands in three-quarter view facing away, while the horse on the right is in profile, looking toward the right edge of the scene.\"",
