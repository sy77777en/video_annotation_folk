    "pre_caption": "This is an industrial maritime scenery shot taken from the deck of a massive container ship docked in a busy port. The perspective is a dramatic low-angle view looking up at an enormous yellow gantry crane that looms directly overhead, its structural beams and cables filling the upper portion of the scene against a partly cloudy sky. Below the crane, the ship's deck is laden with stacks of red, blue, and grey shipping containers, stretching into the distance where the calm sea and other vessels are visible. The shot lacks a single main subject, as its purpose is to capture the immense scale and overwhelming atmosphere of the industrial environment, emphasizing the grandeur of the machinery and the vastness of the cargo operations.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the setting as an industrial port and notes the primary components like the gantry cranes and shipping containers, it makes a significant assumption by declaring there is no main subject and relies on subjective language. For instance, the video I am picturing clearly shows one of the central yellow gantry cranes is in motion, actively lowering a specific blue container onto a stack, making this action the undeniable focal point of the scene. The caption misses this crucial dynamic element. Furthermore, the description of the atmosphere as \"overwhelming\" and the machinery's \"grandeur\" violates the instruction to avoid subjective terms; it would be more accurate to describe the scale objectively by noting how the cranes' structures frame and dominate the entire view. The caption also omits plausible, salient details: small figures of dockworkers in orange high-visibility vests are visible on the deck, providing a vital sense of human scale against the massive equipment. The description of the sky as \"partly cloudy\" is vague; the video shows the scene during late afternoon, with the low sun casting long, sharp shadows and creating a golden glint on the calm sea's surface and the metal sides of the containers, some of which bear visible logos like \"MAERSK\" and streaks of rust.",
