    "pre_caption": "The video initially focuses on an old, beige CRT computer monitor displaying a real-time strategy game. The game shows a map with a light-colored, irregularly shaped landmass, dotted with green elements resembling trees, against a dark, unexplored background. A game interface with text and icons is visible at the bottom and right of the screen. As the view widens, a matching beige keyboard and mouse appear on a dark wooden desk in front of the monitor. Subsequently, a white, low-polygon humanoid figure is revealed sitting at the desk, interacting with the computer. This figure, seen from the chest up on the left side of the frame, has stylized, angular features, including curly hair, and its hands are positioned on the keyboard and mouse. The computer remains fully visible on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a full shot of a computer screen. Then, the camera moves backward to reveal a humanoid figure using the computer, with their chest-up body visible on the left side of the frame, while the computer remains fully visible.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the primary subjects and the sequence of their reveal, but it lacks dynamism and misses key details that convey the video's narrative and aesthetic. It describes the figure's hands as \"positioned\" on the keyboard and mouse, which is too static; in the video, the figure's blocky fingers are clearly animated, tapping specific keys and making distinct clicks with the mouse. Crucially, the caption fails to connect these actions to the on-screen game, omitting the direct cause-and-effect where the figure's input commands units to move across the map and construct buildings. The description of the low-polygon figure is also incomplete, as it neglects to mention that the figure periodically leans forward in concentration and that its head, which lacks facial features, subtly tracks the action on the screen. Furthermore, the \"subtitle overlay\" is not just present but provides running commentary on the game's strategy in a pixelated font, a vital piece of context the caption omits. Lastly, the description of the CRT monitor misses the characteristic screen flicker and visible scan lines that are intentionally emphasized to reinforce the retro-gaming theme.",
