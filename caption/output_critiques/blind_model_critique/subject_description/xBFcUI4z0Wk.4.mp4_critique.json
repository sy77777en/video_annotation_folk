    "pre_caption": "The main subject is a damaged race car, stopped at an angle with its front end on a grassy area and its rear on a paved surface. The car is a white and black Ford stock car with a large red number \"98\" on its side and roof. The front half of the vehicle is white, while the rear half is black. A blue oval \"Ford\" logo is visible on the crumpled hood and the rear quarter panel, which also features \"Ford Performance\" text. The front of the car is heavily damaged, with the hood bent upwards, and a small amount of smoke or steam rises from the front. A secondary subject, a white Ford pickup truck with \"BUILT FORD TOUGH\" on the front, is positioned on the paved surface behind the race car.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a strong, detailed description of the damaged race car, accurately capturing its branding, number, and the nature of the damage to its front end. However, it completely omits the most critical human element of the scene. In the video, the driver, a man in a white and red racing suit, is visible in the cockpit, lowering the window net, indicating he is conscious. Furthermore, the caption mentions the safety truck but fails to describe its crew or key features; the video clearly shows two safety workers in silver fire-retardant suits dismounting the truck, which has its yellow emergency lights flashing, and cautiously approaching the wrecked car. The description of \"smoke or steam\" is also imprecise; the video shows white steam billowing consistently from the crumpled hood, characteristic of a radiator failure, not smoke from a fire. Lastly, the caption misses the contextual detail of other race cars driving slowly past the scene in the background under a caution flag, which helps establish the setting as an active race event.",
