    "pre_caption": "A person in tactical gear moves cautiously while holding a black rifle. They are wearing a black helmet and a full-face gas mask with a large, orange-tinted visor. Their uniform includes a brownish-green jacket under a tactical vest of a similar color, with a solid blue square patch on the left shoulder. They are also wearing black gloves.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the two subjects and their core equipment, such as the tactical gear, helmets, and gas masks, it could be significantly improved by adding more specific details and adhering more closely to the instructions. The primary weakness is the failure to distinguish between the two individuals; they are described collectively, whereas they could be differentiated by their position and actions, such as \"the lead individual on the right moving in a low crouch\" and \"the second individual on the left providing cover from behind.\" The description is also incomplete, as it omits any mention of their lower bodies; details like matching brownish-green cargo pants and black combat boots would create a more complete picture. Furthermore, the description of their equipment is too general. \"Black rifles\" could be enhanced by noting they are assault rifles, and mentioning visible attachments like a red-dot sight on one of them would add valuable specificity. Similarly, describing the tactical vests as being equipped with multiple magazine pouches would be more informative. Finally, replacing the vague action \"move cautiously\" with a more precise description of their tactical movement and posture would provide a much clearer understanding of the scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The lead individual on the right moves in a low crouch, wearing tactical gear that includes a black helmet and a full-face gas mask with a large, orange-tinted visor. They are dressed in a brownish-green jacket under a tactical vest equipped with multiple magazine pouches, and a solid blue square patch on the left shoulder. Their lower body is clad in matching brownish-green cargo pants and black combat boots. In their hands is a black assault rifle with a red-dot sight. The second individual on the left provides cover from behind, similarly outfitted in tactical gear and holding an assault rifle. Both individuals wear black gloves, enhancing their grip and protection.",
