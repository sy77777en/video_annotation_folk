    "pre_caption": "The video is a landscape scenery shot focusing on expansive rice paddies. The emphasis is on the environment and atmosphere, showcasing a patchwork of vibrant green and brown fields, interspersed with water-filled sections reflecting the sky. The scene captures the scale and layout of the paddies, with lines and patterns formed by the fields and irrigation channels. Lush greenery and distant trees frame the paddies, enhancing the sense of vastness and tranquility. The absence of a specific main subject allows the viewer to appreciate the overall beauty and harmony of the rural landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot).Explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subject as a landscape of rice paddies, it misses several key visual details and relies too heavily on subjective language forbidden by the instructions, such as \"breathtaking\" and \"serene.\" The description of the fields as \"rectangular\" is inaccurate; the video shows curved, terraced paddies that follow the contours of a rolling hillside. The caption fails to mention the two farmers, small figures in the midground wearing traditional conical hats, who are bent over and tending to the crops in a water-filled section. Furthermore, it omits the specific time of day, which is clearly early morning, indicated by the low-angle golden sunlight casting long shadows and a light mist hovering over the water's surface. A crucial element missing is the camera's motion; the video is not a static view but a slow, sweeping aerial shot that moves from left to right, gradually revealing the vastness of the terraced landscape. The description of the huts is also too vague, as they are clearly identifiable as simple wooden structures on stilts with thatched roofs. An improved caption would replace emotional descriptors with these concrete, objective details about the subjects, lighting, and camera movement.",
