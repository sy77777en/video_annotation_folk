    "pre_caption": "The video features two women engaged in preparing food. The woman in the center is wearing a white blouse with a subtle pattern and has her hair styled in a bun. She is looking down at a bowl of noodles on the table. The woman on the right, partially visible, is wearing a blue top and has shoulder-length hair. She is using chopsticks to add chili to the bowl of noodles. The scene conveys a collaborative cooking activity, with the focus on the preparation of the dish.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video shows two women. The woman in white is positioned at the center, with her upper body visible. The woman in blue is on the right side of the frame, with only half of her upper body visible. She is using chopsticks to place chili into a bowl of noodles in the lower left corner of the frame.**",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the number of subjects (two women), their actions (preparing food), and the key objects involved (bowl of noodles, chopsticks, chili). The descriptions of their clothing (white blouse with a pattern, blue top), hairstyles (bun, shoulder-length), and specific actions (looking down, adding chili with chopsticks) are precise and verifiable from the visual information described.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete and provides a well-rounded summary of the video's content. It successfully identifies the main subjects and their relationship to the central activity. It describes not only their appearance but also their specific roles in the action, which gives a full picture of the scene. While more minute details could always be added (e.g., the material of the bowl, the type of noodles), the caption strikes an excellent balance between detail and conciseness, as requested by the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres exceptionally well to all the given rules:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is succinct yet packed with essential information about the subjects and their activity.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the two women and the food they are preparing, correctly ignoring the background.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **No Speculation:** It describes only what is visible, even noting that one woman is \"partially visible.\"\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses neutral, descriptive language and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. The phrase \"collaborative cooking activity\" is an objective summary of the observed actions, not an emotional interpretation.\n*   **Clear Subject Differentiation:** It effectively distinguishes between the two women using their location (\"in the center,\" \"on the right\") and appearance.\n*   **Logical Structure:** The description is presented as a single, coherent paragraph in simple, natural English. It follows a logical flow, starting with a general overview and then detailing each subject.\n*   **Formatting:** The output is a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions perfectly. It is accurate, comprehensive without being overly verbose, and meticulously adheres to every stylistic and content-related constraint.",
