The northern lights appear as broad, shifting curtains of light that fill the dark sky, with faint stars visible in the background. A dark silhouette of a dense evergreen treeline marks the horizon, separating the bright white, snow-covered ground from the dynamic sky. There is no main subject, as the composition is designed to emphasize the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural phenomenon and the vast landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good overview of the scene but misses several key visual details that add depth and dynamism to the experience. While it correctly identifies the aurora as \"vibrant green,\" it fails to mention the subtle but distinct bands of pink and violet that appear along the bottom edge of the light curtains as they intensify. The description of the aurora as \"shifting\" is also an understatement; the video is a time-lapse, and the lights are shown to pulse and spiral with energetic speed, which is a more specific and compelling action. Furthermore, the caption omits a crucial foreground element: a partially frozen river whose dark, flowing water catches a shimmering reflection of the northern lights, creating a strong visual anchor that contrasts with the static, snow-covered banks. Lastly, the silhouette of the treeline is not entirely uniform; a few taller pine trees on the right are closer and more defined, their snow-heavy branches catching the green glow, which adds a sense of scale and depth to the composition that the current description lacks.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video captures a breathtaking landscape scene of the aurora borealis, with vibrant green lights illuminating a wintry night. The northern lights appear as broad, dynamic curtains of light, accented by subtle bands of pink and violet along their lower edges. In this time-lapse, the aurora pulses and spirals energetically across the sky, with faint stars twinkling in the background. A partially frozen river in the foreground reflects the shimmering lights, providing a striking visual anchor against the static, snow-covered banks. The horizon is marked by a dense evergreen treeline, with a few taller pine trees on the right standing closer and more defined, their snow-laden branches catching the green glow. This composition emphasizes the grand scale and atmospheric beauty of the natural phenomenon, enhanced by the depth and dynamism of the scene.",
