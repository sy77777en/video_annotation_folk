    "pre_caption": "A brown cartoon mouse with a tan face and large pink ears, identified as Jerry, is depicted in mid-air, looking down. Below him, a blue-grey cartoon cat with a white muzzle and wide yellow eyes, identified as Tom, is also falling. Tom is surrounded by the blurry, shattered pieces of a light fixture. The focus then shifts to Jerry, who is shown spinning in the air with his arms and legs spread wide.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The video begins with a high-angle full shot of Jerry watching Tom midair as Tom falls to the ground along with the ceiling light. As Tom descends, the video shifts to Jerry spinning in midair, spreading his arms, and gracefully falling to the ground.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the subjects and the sequence of events, it could be more specific about the classic cartoonish details that likely define the scene. For instance, Tom's fall is probably more expressive than just having \"wide yellow eyes\"; he might have a look of sheer panic, with his mouth wide open in a scream and his claws unsheathed and flailing uselessly. The \"blurry, shattered pieces of a light fixture\" could be described more vividly as a shower of glittering glass shards from a crystal chandelier, with motion blur emphasizing the speed of their descent around Tom. The description of the transition as a \"focus shift\" might be inaccurate for animation; it is more likely a hard cut to a close-up of Jerry, possibly against a stylized background with speed lines to emphasize the dizzying velocity of his spin. Furthermore, Jerry's spin could be detailed as a rapid, pinwheeling motion rather than just having his limbs \"spread wide.\" Finally, the initial moment where Jerry looks at Tom could be enhanced by describing Jerry's expression—perhaps a moment of smug satisfaction or shared panic—which would add a layer of comedic context to their shared predicament.",
