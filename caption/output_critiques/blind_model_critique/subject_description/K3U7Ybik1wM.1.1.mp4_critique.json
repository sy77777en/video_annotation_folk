    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption. It perfectly adheres to all the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"vintage-style armchair\" and precisely describes its key visual attributes: \"upholstered in red patterned fabric,\" \"high back,\" and \"carved wooden legs.\" It also accurately describes its location (\"on a carpeted landing behind a wooden railing\") and the primary action of the video, which is the \"psychedelic visual effect\" causing the pattern to \"warp and swirl\" with \"multicolored concentric circles.\"\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is both concise and complete. It captures the most essential static details of the subject and its setting, and then fully describes the dynamic visual effect that is the central focus of the video. It provides enough information for a reader to form a clear mental image without including superfluous details.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule in the instructions:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It effectively summarizes the video's content in a single, clear paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is centered entirely on the armchair and the effect applied to it.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the video as a whole (\"Throughout the video\") rather than focusing on a single moment.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It avoids forbidden words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Appropriate Use of Motion/Background:** It mentions the background (\"landing,\" \"railing\") only to establish the subject's location, and it describes the motion (\"warp,\" \"swirl,\" \"ripple\") because it is the key event in the video and a property of the subject itself.\n*   **Objective Language:** It avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. \"Vintage-style\" and \"psychedelic\" are used as descriptive classifiers of a style, not as opinions.\n*   **Precise Subject Identification:** It uses the precise term \"armchair.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details about the chair's fabric, color, pattern, and construction.\n*   **Single Paragraph Format:** The final output is a single, coherent paragraph.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is clear, detailed, objective, and perfectly formatted.",
