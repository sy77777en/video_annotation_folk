    "pre_caption": "A small, cloaked figure and a much larger, imposing figure face each other. The smaller figure is clad in a dark purple, hooded cloak and wields a sword that emits a bright purple glow. The larger figure is enveloped in a heavy cloak composed of large, overlapping grey feathers or scales, and its head is adorned with horns or antlers. It holds a large, simple sword. A tall, dark, rectangular monolith with a rounded top floats vertically between them, its surface covered in a network of glowing red and pink cracks resembling lightning. In an alternate view, the monolith is replaced by a tall, arched doorway that radiates brilliant white light.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate, very complete, and adheres almost perfectly to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the key subjects: a small figure, a large figure, a monolith, and a doorway. The descriptions of their attributes are precise and match the visual information. For example, it correctly notes the small figure's \"dark purple, hooded cloak\" and \"sword that emits a bright purple glow,\" and the large figure's cloak of \"grey feathers or scales\" and \"horns or antlers.\" The handling of ambiguity (\"feathers or scales,\" \"horns or antlers\") is a sign of a high-quality, accurate description, as it avoids making unsubstantiated claims.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It captures all the most salient visual details of the subjects without getting bogged down in unnecessary information about the background. It successfully describes the two distinct states of the scene—one with the monolith and one with the doorway—providing a comprehensive overview of the video's content.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions exceptionally well with only one minor deviation.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is both concise and packed with relevant detail.\n    *   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their visual attributes, as instructed.\n    *   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video.\"\n    *   **Holistic Description:** It cleverly combines the different views into one description using the phrase \"In an alternate view,\" which perfectly describes the content switching without referring to specific frames or cuts.\n    *   **Precise Identification:** It uses clear terms (\"figure,\" \"monolith,\" \"doorway\") and distinguishes the two figures effectively by their size.\n    *   **Objective Language:** For the most part, the language is objective and descriptive.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The instruction states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption uses the word **\"imposing\"** to describe the larger figure. While descriptive, \"imposing\" is a subjective interpretation of the figure's presence. A more objective alternative, sticking purely to visual facts, would be to rely on the already-stated attributes like \"much larger\" and its specific features.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the instructions by providing a detailed, accurate, and well-structured description. The way it handles the changing central object is particularly effective. The only flaw is the use of a single subjective adjective, which is a very minor point in an otherwise outstanding caption.",
