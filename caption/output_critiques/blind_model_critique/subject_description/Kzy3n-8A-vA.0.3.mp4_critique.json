The focus is on establishing the lively, retro atmosphere of the environment rather than highlighting a specific subject. The street is lined with low-rise buildings adorned with signs like a large vertical pink \"MRS MUFF\" sign, a red arrow for \"MUDDY'S MUDFLAPS,\" and a green arrow pointing down that reads \"EAT.\" A red fire truck drives down the center of the road, followed by a small, light-colored car, while two classic cars, one red and one teal, are parked on the right, all contributing to the bustling yet nostalgic ambiance of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions, particularly regarding subjectivity and the correct application of the \"scenery shot\" rule.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe descriptive details of the subjects themselves appear to be accurate. It correctly identifies a \"red fire truck,\" a \"small, light-colored car,\" and two parked \"classic cars\" (one \"red\" and one \"teal\"). It also accurately transcribes the text and colors of several neon signs (\"MRS MUFF,\" \"MUDDY'S MUDFLAPS,\" \"EAT\"). The description of the subjects' actions (driving, parked) and locations (center of the road, on the right) is also factually correct.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is reasonably complete, covering the most prominent moving and stationary subjects, as well as the key environmental details (neon signs, buildings) that define the scene. It successfully combines details from across the video into a single, coherent description.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the instructions in two critical ways:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Use of the \"Scenery Shot\" Rule:** The instructions state that a video should only be described as a scenery shot if there are **no salient subjects**. This video, as described by the caption itself, clearly contains multiple salient subjects: a moving red fire truck, another moving car, and two distinct classic cars. The fire truck, in particular, is a primary, moving subject. The caption incorrectly opens by classifying it as a scenery shot where the \"focus is on establishing the... atmosphere... rather than highlighting a specific subject,\" which is a direct contradiction of the video's content. It should have been written as a subject-focused description from the start.\n\n2.  **Use of Subjective and Interpretive Language:** The instructions explicitly state, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption violates this rule repeatedly by using words and phrases that describe atmosphere and feeling rather than objective visual facts.\n    *   **\"vibrant cityscape\"**: \"Vibrant\" is subjective.\n    *   **\"lively, retro atmosphere\"**: \"Lively\" and \"retro\" are interpretations of the scene's mood, not direct visual descriptions.\n    *   **\"bustling yet nostalgic ambiance\"**: \"Bustling\" and \"nostalgic\" are highly subjective and interpretive.\n\n**Other points of non-adherence:**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The first two sentences and the final clause are dedicated to explaining the \"atmosphere\" and \"ambiance.\" Because this is subjective and violates the rules, this content is unnecessary and makes the caption less concise. A compliant caption would focus only on describing the subjects.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately identifies the objects in the video, it fundamentally misunderstands and misapplies the core instructions. It incorrectly frames a subject-filled scene as a scenery shot and is filled with the exact type of subjective, atmospheric language the instructions forbid.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a small town's main street at night, featuring a red fire truck driving down the center of the road, followed by a small, light-colored car.
