    "pre_caption": "The video features a hand holding a yellow walkie-talkie with a black antenna and buttons, positioned in the lower left corner. The hand appears to be of a person with light skin. The background consists of a rocky landscape with scattered trees and a clear sky, suggesting an outdoor setting. The hand remains in a similar position throughout, indicating a consistent focus on the walkie-talkie.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it fails to follow several key instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is factually accurate in describing the visible elements: a hand, a yellow walkie-talkie, and a rocky landscape.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The description of the main subject (the hand and walkie-talkie) is adequate, noting color and key parts.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption violates the following rules:\n\n*   **Unnecessary Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is introductory text. The instructions require the description to start directly with the subject.\n*   **Describing the Background:** The instruction explicitly states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects.\" The description of the \"rocky landscape with scattered trees and a clear sky\" is not necessary to identify or describe the hand and walkie-talkie, making its inclusion a direct violation.\n*   **Using Speculative Language:** The caption uses phrases like \"appears to be\" and \"suggesting an outdoor setting.\" The instructions state, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" This phrasing introduces uncertainty, which should be avoided.\n*   **Describing Motion and Inferring Intent:** The final sentence, \"The hand remains in a similar position throughout, indicating a consistent focus on the walkie-talkie,\" describes the lack of motion and infers the video's intent. This is unnecessary information that violates the rule against describing motion unless essential for context.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that correctly follows all the given instructions:\n\nA person with light skin holds a yellow walkie-talkie with a black antenna and black buttons. The hand holding the device is positioned in the lower left.",
