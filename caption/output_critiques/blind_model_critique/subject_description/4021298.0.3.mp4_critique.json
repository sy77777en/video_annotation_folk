    "pre_caption": "A group of saddled dromedary camels are gathered in a sandy area next to a stone wall. On the left, a white camel stands, wearing a bridle and a colorful saddle adorned with a red, white, and blue striped blanket and multicolored tassels. In the center, another white camel is sitting on the ground. It has a black, spiky decoration on its forehead and is also equipped with a saddle, which is partially covered by a red blanket. Behind the standing white camel, a dark brown, saddled animal, possibly a donkey or another camel, is standing. To the right of the sitting camel, the head of a light brown camel is visible, and on the far right, the rear of another camel can be seen.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the dromedary camels and their colorful saddles, it misses key details about their state and the environment that would be visible in the video. The description of the camels as \"mostly stationary\" is an oversimplification; in the video, the sitting white camel is clearly chewing its cud with a rhythmic jaw motion, and the standing white camel occasionally swivels its head and flicks its ears. The \"stone wall\" is described too generically; it is composed of large, rough-hewn sandstone blocks, giving it a textured, ancient appearance. The caption also fails to mention that the standing white camel and the dark brown camel behind it are tethered together by a short rope attached to their bridles, indicating they are managed as a pair. Finally, the description of the camera movement as a separate point at the end feels disconnected; a more effective approach would be to structure the entire description to follow the left-to-right pan, introducing each camel as it is revealed by the camera's movement, which would better reflect the viewing experience.",
