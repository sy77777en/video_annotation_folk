    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a train corridor, wearing a green and red cap, a white shirt, and a dark vest with a tie. He has a mustache and is holding a small tree wrapped in netting. Behind him, another man is visible, wearing a Santa hat and a dark coat. The first man appears to be walking forward, with a focused expression, while the second man follows closely.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption successfully identifies the two main subjects and their core actions, but it lacks the specific visual texture and dynamic interplay that make the scene compelling. The description of the first man’s clothing, such as the \"green and red cap\" and \"dark vest,\" is too general; the cap is a distinctive plaid newsboy cap, and the vest is made of a dark tweed material, which adds to his slightly old-fashioned appearance. The central prop, the \"small tree,\" is more than just \"wrapped in netting\"; it's a small fir tree whose root ball is secured in burlap before being netted, and the man holds it upright and protectively, suggesting it has significant personal value. Most importantly, the caption understates the relationship between the two men. The first man isn't just \"walking forward,\" he's hurrying with a sense of anxious purpose through the narrow, wood-paneled corridor. The second man isn't merely \"following\"; his slow, deliberate pace and the fixed, almost predatory smile beneath his Santa hat create a feeling of suspense, suggesting he is stalking the first man rather than simply trailing behind him. The description could be improved by using more dynamic language to capture this tension and by providing more specific details about the subjects' attire and the key object they are interacting over.",

His mustache adds to his slightly old-fashioned appearance as he protectively cradles a small fir tree, its root ball secured in burlap and netting, suggesting it holds significant personal value. Behind him, another man, wearing a Santa hat and a dark coat, follows with a slow, deliberate pace. His fixed, almost predatory smile creates a palpable tension, as if he is stalking the first man rather than merely trailing him.",
