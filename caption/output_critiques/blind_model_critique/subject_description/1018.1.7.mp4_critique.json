    "pre_caption": "The video features a man in a train corridor, wearing a green and red cap, a white shirt, and a dark vest with a tie. He has a mustache and is holding a small tree wrapped in netting. Behind him, another man is visible, wearing a Santa hat and a dark coat. The first man appears to be walking forward, with a focused expression, while the second man follows closely.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that effectively and accurately describes the video while adhering closely to all instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two men and the small tree. The descriptions of their clothing (green and red cap, white shirt, dark vest, tie, Santa hat, dark coat), facial hair (mustache), and the object being carried (small tree wrapped in netting) are all precise and correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is comprehensive, capturing all the most salient visual information. It not only details the appearance of the subjects but also their actions (\"walking forward,\" \"follows closely\") and their spatial relationship (\"Behind him\"), which adds valuable context.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption excels in following the provided guidelines:\n*   **Concise and Clear:** It is a single, well-structured paragraph written in simple, natural English.\n*   **Focus on Subjects:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes, correctly using the background (\"train corridor\") and motion (\"walking forward\") only to provide necessary context and distinguish the subjects' actions and relationship.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It successfully avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Precise Subject Types:** It uses specific terms like \"man\" and \"tree.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific visual details for both people and the object as instructed.\n*   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between \"a man\" (the main subject) and \"another man\" (the secondary subject), prioritizing the description of the main subject first, which is appropriate.\n*   **Objectivity:** It avoids subjective emotional language. The term \"focused expression\" is an acceptable and objective description of the man's facial state rather than an emotional interpretation.\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions to produce a high-quality, informative description.",
