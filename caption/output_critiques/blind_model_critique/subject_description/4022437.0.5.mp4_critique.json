    "pre_caption": "This video presents an interior view of a car, looking forward from the back seat. The most prominent subjects are the tan leather car seats. The back of the front left seat, with its stitched seams and a lower storage pocket, occupies the foreground. To its right, the front passenger seat, also tan leather, is visible with its headrest. Above, a rectangular, tinted glass sunroof is set into the light-colored roof lining, where a grab handle is also visible near the right side. As the perspective slightly lowers, the rear section of the center console appears between the front seats, featuring a silver-trimmed air vent. The front passenger door is open, revealing a bright exterior through the window.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good foundational description of the car's interior and the camera's general movement, but it lacks specificity and fails to capture the interplay of light and texture that defines the shot. For instance, it describes the view through the open passenger door as merely \"a bright exterior,\" whereas the video clearly shows a sun-drenched, out-of-focus garden with vibrant green trees, which creates a sense of luxury and tranquility. The description of the center console is also incomplete; it omits the two illuminated USB ports located just below the air vent and fails to mention the distinct, glossy grain of the Burl Walnut wood finish. Furthermore, while the \"stitched seams\" on the tan leather are noted, the caption misses that the stitching is a contrasting cream color and that the seat inserts are perforated, both significant design details. Most importantly, the description treats each element in isolation and misses the video's primary visual effect: the way the bright, natural light floods in, casting a warm glow on the leather and creating sharp, reflective highlights on the polished wood and silver trim, which the slow, deliberate downward pan is clearly designed to emphasize.",
