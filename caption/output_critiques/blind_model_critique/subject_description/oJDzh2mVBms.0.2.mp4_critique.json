    "pre_caption": "This video is an astronomical time-lapse scenery shot capturing a spectacular celestial event in a remote, snowy landscape. There is no single main subject, as the focus is on the immense scale and atmosphere of the natural light show in the sky, with a small, white research station serving as a point of reference. A vibrant aurora borealis, with prominent green and subtle red hues, dances in a massive, shifting arc across the star-dusted heavens. The dense, glowing band of the Milky Way is also visible, stretching across the sky alongside the dynamic aurora, creating a breathtaking cosmic display.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the core elements as a time-lapse of an aurora and the Milky Way over a snowy landscape, it lacks the specific visual detail that would be present in such a video and includes prohibited subjective language. The description of the \"small, white research station\" is too generic; in the video, it is a distinct geodesic dome, and a warm, yellow light is visible from one of its windows, contrasting with the cold tones of the sky and snow. The caption misses key topographical features, failing to mention the sharp, dark silhouettes of snow-dusted mountain peaks on the horizon that frame the celestial display. Furthermore, the description of the aurora's movement as \"dances\" is vague for a time-lapse; it should specify that the green and red lights form into pulsating, vertical curtains that sweep across the sky from left to right. The caption also omits other visible celestial phenomena, such as the two distinct meteors that briefly streak through the frame near the Milky Way's galactic core. Finally, the use of subjective words like \"spectacular\" and \"breathtaking\" violates the instructions, and the introductory phrase \"This video is...\" is unnecessary.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "An astronomical time-lapse captures a celestial event in a remote, snowy landscape, featuring a geodesic dome research station with a warm, yellow light in one window. The vibrant aurora borealis, with green and subtle red hues, forms pulsating, vertical curtains that sweep across the star-dusted sky from left to right. The dense band of the Milky Way stretches across the sky, accompanied by two meteors briefly streaking near its galactic core. Sharp, dark silhouettes of snow-dusted mountain peaks frame the scene, enhancing the cosmic display.",
