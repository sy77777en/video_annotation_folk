    "pre_caption": "The video features a young girl with light skin and long, dark braided hair. She is wearing a dark blue dress with short sleeves. The girl is interacting with a large, dark-colored box, which she is opening and peering into. Her posture is leaning forward, with her hands gripping the box, indicating curiosity or intent focus. The box has a latch and appears to be made of a sturdy material. The setting suggests an intimate, possibly personal space, as indicated by the girl's close engagement with the box.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it fails to adhere to several key instructions, primarily by including subjective interpretations and speculation.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The description of the subjects' physical attributes is accurate. It correctly identifies a \"young girl with light skin and long, dark braided hair\" wearing a \"dark blue dress\" and a \"large, dark-colored box\" with a \"latch.\" The description of her posture (\"leaning forward\") and action (\"opening and peering into\") is also factually correct.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is reasonably complete, focusing on the two main subjects (the girl and the box) and their interaction. It successfully captures the most salient visual information in the video.\n\n**Adherence to the Instruction:**\nThe caption violates several core rules outlined in the instructions:\n\n*   **Violation 1: Describing Subjective States.** The instruction states, \"You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The caption says the girl's posture is \"...indicating curiosity or intent focus.\" \"Curiosity\" and \"focus\" are internal states or emotions, not directly observable visual attributes. The caption should describe the action (leaning, peering) without interpreting the reason behind it.\n\n*   **Violation 2: Speculating About the Setting.** The instruction states, \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary\" and \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" The final sentence, \"The setting suggests an intimate, possibly personal space, as indicated by the girl's close engagement with the box,\" is entirely speculative. It infers an atmosphere (\"intimate\") and a type of location (\"personal space\") based on the subject's actions, which is explicitly forbidden.\n\n*   **Violation 3: Using Hedging Language.** The instruction asks for a confident description of what is visible. The phrase \"...appears to be made of a sturdy material\" is slightly weak. While \"sturdy\" is an interpretation of its appearance, a more direct description of its visual texture or thickness would be better if visible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the caption accurately describes the physical appearance of the subjects, it fails significantly by including subjective interpretations of the girl's internal state and speculating about the nature of the setting. These violations directly contradict the core requirements for an objective, fact-based description. A good caption would have described only the observable facts: the girl's appearance, the box's features, and the physical actions she performs.",

The girl is interacting with a large, dark-colored box, which she is opening and looking into. Her posture is leaning forward, with her hands gripping the box. The box has a latch and appears to have a thick, solid appearance.",
