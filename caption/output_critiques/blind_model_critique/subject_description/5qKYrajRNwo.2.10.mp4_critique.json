    "pre_caption": "The video features a young girl with light skin and long, dark braided hair. She is wearing a dark blue dress with short sleeves. The girl is interacting with a large, dark-colored box, which she is opening and peering into. Her posture is leaning forward, with her hands gripping the box, indicating curiosity or intent focus. The box has a latch and appears to be made of a sturdy material. The setting suggests an intimate, possibly personal space, as indicated by the girl's close engagement with the box.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "The feedback on the caption is as follows: The caption correctly identifies the main subject as a young girl and notes her braided hair and blue dress, but it lacks specificity. For instance, the video shows her with two distinct braids, not just braided hair, and her dress is a simple, navy blue cotton frock. The most significant inaccuracy is the description of the object as a \"dark-colored box.\" The video clearly features a large, antique wooden trunk with a weathered, dark-brown finish and prominent, ornate brass latches and corner fittings. The description of the action is also incomplete; it mentions her opening the trunk but completely omits the most striking visual event: as the lid is lifted, a warm, golden light emanates from within, illuminating her face. Consequently, the caption's assessment of her expression as \"curiosity or intent focus\" is a considerable understatement. Her face, bathed in the mysterious glow, clearly registers a look of pure awe and wonder. Finally, the description of the trunk as being made of a \"sturdy material\" is too vague, and the final sentence about the setting being an \"intimate, possibly personal space\" is a subjective inference that should be replaced with a description of the visible, out-of-focus background elements, such as a dusty rocking horse and stacks of old books, which would more concretely establish the setting as an attic or storage room.",
