The force of the explosion sends the red, pulpy flesh and juice spraying upwards and outwards in a fine mist.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is excellent. It perfectly fulfills the requirements of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"large, green-striped watermelon\" and the surface it's on as a \"brown cardboard box.\" The description of the event—an explosion sending \"red, pulpy flesh and juice spraying upwards and outwards\"—is a precise account of the visual action. The simile comparing the shattered rind to \"the petals of a flower\" is an effective and accurate way to describe the specific shape the rind takes post-explosion.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is very complete. It captures the entire event shown in the video, from the initial state of the watermelon to the dynamic action of the explosion and its aftermath. It includes all the essential visual elements: the subject, its colors (\"green-striped,\" \"red,\" \"dark green\"), its texture (\"pulpy\"), the resulting spray (\"fine mist\"), and the final form of the shattered rind.\n\n### Adherence to the Given Instruction\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that provides a rich description without unnecessary words.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the watermelon and the immediate action, correctly omitting irrelevant background details.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"video,\" \"frame,\" or \"image.\"\n*   **Appropriate Use of Motion:** It describes motion (\"exploding,\" \"spraying,\" \"peeling back\") because it is the central and defining action of the video.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive adjectives (\"large,\" \"green-striped,\" \"red,\" \"pulpy\") rather than subjective or emotional ones.\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms like \"watermelon\" and \"cardboard box.\"\n*   **Detailed Visual Attributes:** It provides excellent detail on the watermelon's appearance, including its stripes, the color and texture of its flesh, and the state of its rind.\n*   **Describes a Process:** It perfectly adheres to the instruction to describe subjects that reveal or change, detailing how the explosion shatters the rind to reveal the red interior.",
