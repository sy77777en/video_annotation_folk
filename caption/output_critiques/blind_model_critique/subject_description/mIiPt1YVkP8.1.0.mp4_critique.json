    "pre_caption": "A white passenger airplane is depicted from a rear, slightly elevated perspective against a solid black background. The aircraft has its landing gear extended, showing two sets of wheels beneath its wings, and two engines are visible, one under each wing. Below the plane, an airport is illuminated at night. A long, brightly lit runway, marked with white and green lights, extends into the distance. To the left of the runway, a complex of lit buildings, representing the airport terminal and surrounding structures, is visible. The entire scene is viewed from the air, positioning the airplane as if it is on its final approach for landing.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a passenger airplane and the setting as an airport at night, it feels more like a description of a static photograph than a video. The phrase \"solid black background\" is too absolute; a video would likely show a dark navy or deep gray sky, possibly with a faint glow from the city below. The description of the landing gear is incomplete, mentioning only the \"two sets of wheels beneath its wings\" while omitting the nose gear, which would almost certainly be visible and extended from the described perspective. Furthermore, the caption misses key visual elements that define a video of this nature, such as the flashing red and green navigation lights on the wingtips and the bright, pulsing white strobe lights on the aircraft's body and tail. The runway lights might also be more dynamic, with sequenced flashing lights leading to the threshold, which isn't mentioned. Finally, the language is slightly interpretive (\"representing the airport terminal,\" \"as if it is on its final approach\"), whereas the instructions call for a direct description of what is visible; the plane's configuration and position relative to the runway already convey the action of landing without needing explicit interpretation.",
