    "pre_caption": "The video features a painted wooden nesting doll, primarily blue with floral patterns and a depiction of a musical instrument on the front. The doll is upright initially, with a hand entering the scene, characterized by light skin and fingers slightly curled. The hand interacts with the doll, causing it to fall and lie on its side. The focus is on the interaction between the hand and the doll, highlighting the doll's intricate design and the hand's movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.\n\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is partially good, but it contains several clear violations of the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its description. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"painted wooden nesting doll\" and the secondary subject as a \"hand.\" The visual attributes described (blue color, floral patterns, musical instrument, light skin) and the sequence of events (doll is upright, hand enters, doll falls) are precise and fact-based.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete. It covers the two main subjects, their key visual characteristics, their initial states, and the central interaction that defines the video's action. No essential visual information appears to be missing.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThis is where the caption has significant issues.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n*   **Concise and Clear:** The language is simple and easy to understand.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"nesting doll,\" \"hand\") instead of vague ones.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It provides specific visual details for both the doll and the hand (color, pattern, material, skin tone).\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the sequence of events as a continuous action without referring to specific \"frames\" or \"images.\"\n*   **Use of Motion:** It correctly includes motion (\"entering the scene,\" \"interacts,\" \"causing it to fall\") because it is essential to describe the action.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n*   **Use of Introductory Text:** The caption begins with \"The video features...\", which is explicitly against the instruction to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\" The description should start directly with the scene's content (e.g., \"A painted wooden nesting doll, primarily blue...\").\n*   **Meta-Commentary:** The final sentence, \"The focus is on the interaction between the hand and the doll, highlighting the doll's intricate design and the hand's movement,\" is a major violation. It describes the *filmmaker's intent* or the *video's focus* rather than simply describing the visible subjects and their actions. The instructions require describing what is seen, not interpreting the composition or purpose of the shot.\n*   **Subjective Language:** The word \"intricate\" is a subjective adjective that conveys an opinion about the quality of the design. The instructions state to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" A more objective description would stick to the observable patterns.\n\nIn summary, while the caption accurately and completely describes the visual content, it fails to follow key formatting and content rules, particularly by including introductory text and meta-commentary about the video's focus.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A painted wooden nesting doll, primarily blue with floral patterns and a depiction of a musical instrument on the front, stands upright. A hand with light skin and slightly curled fingers enters the scene, interacting with the doll and causing it to fall and lie on its side. The description focuses on the interaction and the visual details of the doll and the hand.",
