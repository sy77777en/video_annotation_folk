    "pre_caption": "The main subject of the video is a young boy with pale skin, wearing a bright red long-sleeved shirt and dark pants. He is singled out by a spotlight, standing with his shoulders hunched forward. Surrounding him are numerous other pale-skinned, human-like figures dressed uniformly in dark, non-descript clothing. These figures, which appear to be both male and female, lack distinct facial features. A large group of them stands clustered together to the left, while several others are scattered individually around the boy, some standing still and others walking slowly with a similar hunched posture. The boy's red shirt makes him the only point of color, creating a stark contrast with the monochrome appearance of all the other figures in the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It is highly accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is very accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a \"young boy\" and precisely describes his key visual attributes: \"pale skin,\" \"bright red long-sleeved shirt,\" and \"dark pants.\" It also accurately portrays the surrounding subjects as \"pale-skinned, human-like figures\" in \"dark, non-descript clothing,\" correctly noting their lack of distinct facial features and hunched posture. The description of their arrangement (\"clustered together to the left,\" \"scattered individually\") is also a precise representation of the scene's composition.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is exceptionally complete. It successfully identifies a clear main subject and describes him in detail, while also providing a thorough but concise description of the secondary subjects as a group. It captures the most critical visual element of the scene—the color contrast between the boy's red shirt and the monochrome figures—and explains its significance in making him the focal point. It also includes relevant details about posture (\"shoulders hunched forward\") and slow movement (\"walking slowly\"), which are essential to understanding the subjects' nature.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful adherence to all instructions:\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a rich description in a single, well-structured paragraph.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** The description is entirely centered on the boy and the surrounding figures, avoiding any mention of the background except for the \"spotlight,\" which is justifiably included as it is essential for explaining why the boy is the main subject.\n*   **Objective and Factual:** It uses neutral, descriptive language (e.g., \"bright red,\" \"dark pants,\" \"hunched posture\") and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. The use of \"human-like\" is an excellent example of describing something without making unverified assumptions.\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It clearly distinguishes the \"young boy\" from the \"other... figures\" and effectively uses location and action to describe the arrangement of the secondary subjects.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown, as required.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It synthesizes information from the entire video into a coherent summary without referring to specific frames or using forbidden terms like \"image.\"",
