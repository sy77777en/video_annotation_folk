    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of buffalo standing in tall grass. The buffalo are dark in color, with prominent curved horns and sturdy builds. They are closely gathered, facing forward, and appear calm and stationary. The setting is a natural environment with trees visible in the background, suggesting a savanna or grassland habitat. The buffalo are the primary subjects, collectively forming a cohesive group.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that this video contains **multiple subjects with no clear main focus**. Because it does not emphasize any specific subject, please briefly describe the types of subjects without going into too much detail. You may also describe the subjects collectively as a group.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the subjects as a group of buffalo, it oversimplifies their arrangement and misses key details that would provide a richer description. The statement that the buffalo are all \"standing\" and \"facing forward\" is a generalization that may be inaccurate; in the video, a large bull in the foreground is standing and facing the camera, but several other buffalo behind it are lying down in the tall, yellow grass, and one is turned in profile. The description of their color as simply \"dark\" could be more specific, such as \"dark brown\" or \"nearly black,\" and could include other textural details like dried mud on their flanks. The caption fails to establish a clear visual hierarchy, treating all subjects as a uniform group instead of focusing first on the most prominent animal—the large bull—and describing its specific features, like its massive, bossed horns and its slow chewing motion. A significant detail, such as a small calf nestled between two adults in the mid-ground, is completely omitted. Finally, the last sentence is unnecessary meta-commentary; a strong description makes the primary subjects obvious without needing to state it explicitly.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "In the video, a large bull buffalo stands prominently in the foreground, facing the camera with its massive, bossed horns and slowly chewing. Its dark brown, nearly black coat is textured with patches of dried mud. Behind the bull, several buffalo are lying down in the tall, yellow grass, while one is turned in profile. Among them, a small calf is nestled between two adults in the mid-ground. The setting is a natural savanna or grassland habitat, with trees visible in the background, enhancing the scene's authenticity.",
