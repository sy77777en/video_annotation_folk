    "pre_caption": "The video prominently features a warning sign that reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" with a red triangle containing an exclamation mark, indicating danger. The sign warns about the risks of inhaling asbestos fibers, which may cause cancer, and advises avoiding dusty situations and keeping children away from the tailings. The sign is mounted on a metal pole and is positioned in a natural setting with rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. The landscape includes reddish-brown rock formations and some green shrubs, suggesting a dry, possibly desert-like environment. The sign is the central focus, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it fails to follow several key instructions. While it is accurate and informative, it violates rules regarding meta-commentary, speculation, and conciseness.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the main subject as a warning sign, accurately transcribes the visible text, and correctly describes the symbol (red triangle with an exclamation mark). The description of the environment (rocky terrain, sparse vegetation, metal pole) is also factually correct.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption is very complete. It captures all the essential visual information: the subject, its specific details (text, symbol, mounting), and its environmental context. It successfully conveys the purpose and message of the sign.\n\n**3. Adherence to the Given Instruction:**\nThis is where the caption has significant issues.\n\n*   **Violation:** The caption begins with \"The video prominently features...\" and ends with \"The sign is the central focus, emphasizing the hazardous nature of the area.\" This is meta-commentary. The instructions require you to describe the scene directly, not to describe the video or its composition.\n*   **Violation:** The phrase \"...suggesting a dry, possibly desert-like environment\" is a form of speculation. The instruction states, \"You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.\" You should describe what is seen (rocky terrain, reddish-brown rock) without interpreting it.\n*   **Violation:** The caption is not as concise as it could be. It fully transcribes the warning's advice (\"advises avoiding dusty situations and keeping children away from the tailings\"). A more concise summary would be more effective and adhere better to the instruction.\n*   **Minor Violation:** The phrase \"...indicating danger\" is an interpretation, although a very obvious one. A better approach is to simply describe the symbol itself, as its meaning is universally understood.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that adheres to all the instructions:\n\nA warning sign is mounted on a metal pole in a natural setting of reddish-brown rocky terrain and sparse green shrubs. The white, rectangular sign features a red triangle with an exclamation mark at the top. Below the symbol, black text reads \"ASBESTOS TAILINGS RISK AREA\" and includes further warnings about the risk of cancer from inhaling asbestos fibers.",
