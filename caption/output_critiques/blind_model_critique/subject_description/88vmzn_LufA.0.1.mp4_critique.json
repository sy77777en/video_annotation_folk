    "pre_caption": "The video begins with a close-up of a round, textured metal manhole cover on a paved surface, featuring a grid pattern and several bolt holes. As the scene transitions, the focus shifts to the underside of the manhole cover, revealing a device attached to it. This device consists of several red cylindrical objects resembling dynamite sticks, connected by colorful wires to a digital timer displaying numbers. The transition highlights the concealed nature of the device beneath the manhole cover.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the primary subject as a \"round, textured metal manhole cover\" and accurately describes its features like the \"grid pattern\" and \"bolt holes.\" It then precisely describes the second subject as a \"device\" attached to the underside, detailing its components: \"red cylindrical objects resembling dynamite sticks,\" \"colorful wires,\" and a \"digital timer displaying numbers.\" The use of \"resembling\" is a perfect example of describing appearance without making unconfirmed claims, adhering to the rule of not describing what you are unsure about.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It captures the entire narrative of the video, from the initial view of the manhole cover to the reveal of the device underneath. It includes all the salient visual details of both subjects. The final sentence, \"The transition highlights the concealed nature of the device beneath the manhole cover,\" effectively summarizes the action and relationship between the two subjects, adding valuable context.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption follows every instruction flawlessly:\n*   **Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise yet packed with all the necessary information.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It focuses entirely on the subjects and their attributes.\n*   **Objectivity:** It uses objective, descriptive language (e.g., \"round,\" \"red,\" \"cylindrical\") and avoids subjective or emotional words.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Transitions:** It clearly describes the transition and how the focus shifts to reveal a new subject, fulfilling the instruction to describe how subjects are revealed.\n*   **Detail:** It provides specific visual details for each subject as instructed.",
