    "pre_caption": "A light-skinned man and a light-skinned woman walk together from right to left. The man has short, light brown hair, a short beard, and wears black sunglasses. He is dressed in a brown collared jacket, black pants, and light-colored sneakers with pink accents. The woman walking beside him has long, dark brown hair. She wears a black jacket and black pants, with her arms crossed, and carries a black bag over her shoulder. They both walk out of the left side of the frame, leaving the scene empty of people.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **disappearing from the frame**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how they exit, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the provided instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is excellent and serves as a high-quality example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the rules.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the two subjects as a light-skinned man and a light-skinned woman. All the visual attributes described are correct:\n*   **Man:** The description of his short, light brown hair, short beard, black sunglasses, brown collared jacket, black pants, and light-colored sneakers with pink accents is precise.\n*   **Woman:** The description of her long, dark brown hair, black jacket, black pants, crossed arms, and the black bag over her shoulder is also spot-on.\n*   **Action:** The caption accurately captures their movement from right to left and their eventual exit from the scene.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is very complete, focusing on the most salient information as required.\n*   It provides a thorough description of both subjects, giving enough detail for easy identification.\n*   It correctly describes the key action of the video—the subjects walking across and out of the scene. The final clause, \"leaving the scene empty of people,\" is an excellent addition that fully describes the event's conclusion.\n*   It correctly omits details about the background (e.g., the street, buildings), as it is not necessary for understanding or distinguishing the subjects.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows all the instructions meticulously:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, coherent paragraph that is both brief and rich in detail.\n*   **Subject Focus:** It focuses exclusively on the subjects and their visual attributes.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the entire event without referring to specific frames (e.g., \"in the first frame\").\n*   **Forbidden Terms:** It avoids using \"image\" or \"frame,\" except in the phrase \"out of the left side of the frame,\" which is the most natural and clear way to describe the boundary of the visible area and is acceptable in this context.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses simple, natural English and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives.\n*   **Precise Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"man,\" \"woman\") and distinguishes them by their appearance.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details about clothing, hair, accessories, and pose (\"arms crossed\").\n*   **Describing Disappearance:** It perfectly adheres to the instruction to describe subjects disappearing by stating, \"They both walk out of the left side of the frame, leaving the scene empty of people.\"\n*   **Formatting:** It is returned as a single paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary piece of work that perfectly fulfills every requirement of the instructions. It is clear, detailed, and professionally written.",
