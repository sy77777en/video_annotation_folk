    "pre_caption": "A person wearing a red long-sleeved top, black pants, and a black helmet is shown standing on the edge of a rocky precipice. They are equipped with a blue and black wingsuit and a parachute pack. The individual leaps from the cliff, initiating a BASE jump. As they descend, the blue panels on the back and arms of their wingsuit become prominent.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video has a **main subject with dynamic size**, so the description should focus on them. Don't mention the background scene and other motion.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a good starting point by identifying the subject, their clothing, and the initial action. However, it lacks the dynamic detail and sequential description that a video of a BASE jump would contain. The description stops after the leap, but the most visually dramatic parts of the video likely occur after this moment. For example, the caption fails to describe the subject's body posture during the freefall, such as being in a stable, spread-eagle position. A major omission is the description of the parachute deployment itself; the caption mentions the pack but not the canopy, which, upon opening, would be a new, large, and colorful subject, perhaps a vibrant orange and white rectangular canopy that contrasts sharply with the sky. The description should capture the subject's transition from a rapid fall to a slow, controlled glide under the open parachute, as this change in motion is the core event of the video. Finally, the term \"a person\" is vague; if features like a man's short beard are visible beneath the helmet, specifying the gender would provide a more complete description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A man with a short beard, wearing a red long-sleeved top, black pants, and a black helmet, stands poised on the edge of a rocky precipice. Equipped with a blue and black wingsuit and a parachute pack, he leaps into the void, initiating a thrilling BASE jump. As he descends, his body adopts a stable, spread-eagle position, showcasing the blue panels on the back and arms of his wingsuit. The scene intensifies as he deploys his parachute, revealing a vibrant orange and white rectangular canopy that contrasts sharply with the sky. The transition from a rapid freefall to a slow, controlled glide under the open parachute captures the core excitement of the video, as he gracefully navigates the air currents.",
