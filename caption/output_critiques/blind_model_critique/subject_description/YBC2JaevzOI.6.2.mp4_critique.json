    "pre_caption": "The video is a nighttime cityscape scenery shot, featuring a quiet, empty road illuminated by a series of evenly spaced streetlights that cast pools of light onto the pavement and sidewalk. The darkness of the sky and the absence of vehicles or pedestrians emphasize the stillness and solitude of the urban environment, while the gentle curve of the road and the subtle glow from the lamps create a sense of depth and calm. There is no main subject in this video, as the focus is on capturing the tranquil atmosphere and expansive emptiness of the city at night rather than highlighting any specific object or individual.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is partially good but has significant flaws in its adherence to the instructions. While it correctly identifies the scene type, it fails on several key rules, particularly regarding objectivity and conciseness.\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate in its fundamental description. It correctly identifies the scene as a \"nighttime cityscape scenery shot\" featuring an \"empty road illuminated by... streetlights.\" The details about the lights casting \"pools of light onto the pavement and sidewalk\" and the \"curve of the road\" are factually correct and observable.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption is complete in that it follows the specific instruction for scenery shots. It correctly states that there is no main subject and provides a reason: \"the focus is on capturing the... atmosphere and expansive emptiness of the city at night.\" It successfully describes the overall environment rather than trying to invent a subject that isn't there.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction\nThis is where the caption fails significantly.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions\":** This is the most critical failure. The caption is filled with subjective and emotional language.\n    *   **\"quiet\"**: This is an assumption about sound, not a visual attribute.\n    *   **\"stillness and solitude\"**: These are abstract, interpretive concepts, not direct visual descriptions.\n    *   **\"gentle curve\"**: \"Gentle\" is a subjective descriptor. \"A curve\" or \"a slight curve\" would be more objective.\n    *   **\"subtle glow\"**: \"Subtle\" is a subjective judgment.\n    *   **\"sense of depth and calm\"**: \"Calm\" is a clear emotional adjective, which is explicitly forbidden.\n    *   **\"tranquil atmosphere\"**: \"Tranquil\" is another subjective, emotional word.\n\n*   **Violation of \"Keep the description concise and clear\" and \"Use simple, natural English\":** The caption is overly descriptive and poetic, leaning more towards creative writing than a factual, objective description. Phrases like \"emphasize the stillness and solitude of the urban environment\" and \"create a sense of depth and calm\" make the paragraph verbose and less direct than the instructions require.\n\n*   **Minor Violation of \"Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary\":** While describing the empty road is necessary, the explanation of *why* it's empty (\"absence of vehicles or pedestrians\") is slightly redundant and interpretive. A more direct description would simply state that the road is empty.\n\n*   **Minor Violation of Spirit of the Instructions:** The caption begins with \"The video is...\". While \"video\" is not explicitly forbidden like \"image\" or \"frame,\" the best practice for these instructions is to describe the content directly without referencing the medium itself.\n\n### Corrected Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres strictly to all the instructions:\n\nA nighttime cityscape scenery shot shows an empty, curved road with an adjacent sidewalk. A series of evenly spaced streetlights along the road cast circular pools of light onto the dark pavement. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the urban environment itself.",
