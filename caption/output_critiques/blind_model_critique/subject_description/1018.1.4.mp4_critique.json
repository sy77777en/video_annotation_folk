    "pre_caption": "The video features two men in a room. The main subject is a man wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark vest with gold buttons, and a matching cap. He has a mustache and is actively gesturing with his hands. The secondary subject is a man in a dark suit with a white shirt and tie, wearing a red Santa hat. He holds a large bag and an umbrella. The two men are positioned close to each other, with the main subject in the foreground and the secondary subject slightly behind him. The interaction suggests a dynamic between them, with the main subject appearing more animated.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "This is a good caption, but it has a few significant flaws that prevent it from being great. It successfully follows many instructions but violates a few key ones, particularly regarding objectivity.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAssuming the visual details described are present in the video, the caption appears accurate. It describes two men, their specific clothing (vest with gold buttons, Santa hat), accessories (umbrella, bag), and facial hair (mustache). The relative positioning (one in the foreground, one behind) is also a verifiable, factual detail.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete. It provides a sufficient level of detail for a viewer to form a clear mental picture of both subjects. It covers:\n*   **Subject Type:** \"two men\"\n*   **Key Visual Attributes:** Detailed descriptions of clothing, accessories, and facial hair for both individuals.\n*   **Pose and Position:** It notes their proximity, their foreground/background positioning, and that one man is \"actively gesturing.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\nThis is where the caption has both strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise Paragraph:** It is a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It correctly avoids words like \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" within the description itself.\n*   **Clear Subject Identification:** It clearly identifies the subjects as \"men\" and distinguishes them from each other.\n*   **Describes Visual Attributes:** It provides specific details about clothing and appearance as requested.\n*   **Prioritizes Subjects:** It establishes a hierarchy by describing one man first, then the other.\n\n**Where the caption fails to adhere to instructions:**\n\n1.  **Use of Subjective Language and Interpretation:** The final sentence, *\"The interaction suggests a dynamic between them, with the main subject appearing more animated,\"* is a major violation.\n    *   The instruction states: \"**You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions**\" and \"**avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about.**\"\n    *   \"Suggests a dynamic\" is an interpretation of the relationship, not a visual fact.\n    *   \"Animated\" is a subjective adjective that implies an emotional state (lively, excited) rather than simply describing the physical motion of gesturing.\n\n2.  **Labeling of Subjects:** The caption uses the labels \"main subject\" and \"secondary subject.\" While the instructions advise prioritizing subjects, they also suggest distinguishing them using visual traits (e.g., \"the man in the red dress\"). Labeling them as \"main\" and \"secondary\" is an editorial judgment about their importance, which borders on interpretation. A more objective approach would be to use their appearance or position to distinguish them (e.g., \"The man in the foreground...\" or \"The man wearing a vest...\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is detailed, well-structured, and follows most of the formatting rules. However, it is flawed because it includes subjective interpretation and labeling, directly violating the core instruction to describe only objective, visual facts.\n\nA better, more compliant caption would be:\n\n**\"The video features two men in a room. A man in the foreground wears a white short-sleeved shirt, a dark vest with gold buttons, and a matching cap; he has a mustache and is gesturing with his hands. Positioned slightly behind him is a second man wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, a tie, and a red Santa hat, who holds a large bag and an umbrella.\"**",
