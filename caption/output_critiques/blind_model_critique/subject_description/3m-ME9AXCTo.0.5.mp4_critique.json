    "pre_caption": "A man and a woman are slow-dancing in a close embrace. The man has voluminous, curly, light-blond hair and is wearing a light-colored suit jacket over a dark shirt and bow tie. The woman has long, straight, blond hair and is wearing a light-colored dress with sheer sleeves. A pink and white floral corsage is visible on her wrist. They hold each other tightly, with the woman often resting her head on the man's shoulder or chest as they sway together.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies the two subjects and their central action of slow-dancing, but it could be more specific to better reflect the visual details. The descriptions \"light-colored suit jacket\" and \"light-colored dress\" are vague; the video shows the man in a cream-colored jacket and the woman in an ivory gown with delicate lace embroidery on the bodice, which is a key feature not mentioned. While the caption notes the woman's long, straight hair, it omits that it's styled in a partial updo, with soft strands framing her face. Similarly, the man is described as having \"voluminous, curly, light-blond hair,\" but his clean-shaven face and the gentle, content expression he maintains throughout the dance are not included. A significant detail is missing: the man wears a small pink and white boutonnière on his lapel that matches the woman's corsage, reinforcing their connection. The description of their interaction as \"swaying together\" is accurate but could be enhanced by noting that the man's hand is placed gently on the small of her back and that at one point, he rests his chin on the top of her head, reciprocating her gesture of resting her head on his chest. Adding these specifics would create a more vivid and complete picture of the scene.",
