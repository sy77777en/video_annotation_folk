    "pre_caption": "A muscular man with pale, mottled skin is shown wearing a metallic mask that covers most of his face, with a white section around his open mouth. A large apparatus is attached to his upper back and the back of his head, from which numerous thick, ribbed tubes extend. These tubes are initially a pinkish-red color before transitioning to a glowing, neon green. The man also wears a metallic harness over his shoulders and upper back where the tubes connect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"muscular man\" and precisely describes his visible attributes, such as his \"pale, mottled skin.\" The description of the complex equipment—the \"metallic mask,\" the \"large apparatus,\" the \"thick, ribbed tubes,\" and the \"metallic harness\"—is specific and true to the visual information. The detail about the mask having a \"white section around his open mouth\" is also a precise and accurate observation.\n\n**Completeness:** The caption is very complete. It successfully captures all the most salient features of the subject. Crucially, it includes the dynamic change that occurs in the video—the tubes transitioning from \"pinkish-red\" to \"glowing, neon green.\" This demonstrates that the caption is describing the video as a whole, not just a static image. It correctly omits details that are not visible (like hair or the man's full face), adhering to the instruction to not describe what is uncertain.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption is an excellent example of following the instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It is a single, dense paragraph packed with relevant information without being wordy.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It focuses entirely on the man and his attached equipment, correctly ignoring the background.\n*   **Objective Language:** It uses descriptive, objective adjectives (\"muscular,\" \"pale,\" \"metallic,\" \"ribbed\") and avoids subjective or emotional language.\n*   **Proper Formatting:** It is a single paragraph with no introductory text or Markdown.\n*   **No Forbidden Terms:** It avoids words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific details about the subject's type (\"man\"), physical appearance (\"pale, mottled skin\"), and the objects attached to him (color, material, texture, and shape).\n*   **Describes Change Over Time:** It masterfully handles the video's temporal element by describing how the tubes \"are initially a pinkish-red color before transitioning to a glowing, neon green.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**The caption is excellent.** It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, detailed, objective, and concise, providing a comprehensive and clear description of the video's subject and the key visual transformation that takes place. There are no identifiable flaws or areas for improvement.",
