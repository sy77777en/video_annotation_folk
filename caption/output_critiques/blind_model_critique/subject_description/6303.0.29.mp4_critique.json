    "pre_caption": "The video features a group of seven people on a red sports court, engaged in a circle formation. The subjects include a man in a green jacket and white pants holding a basketball, a woman in a purple dress, a man in an orange hoodie, a man in a blue jacket, a man in a light blue outfit, a woman with long hair wearing a blue cap, and a man in a brown shirt. The basketball, initially held by the man in the green jacket, becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground, revealing a face imprinted on its surface. The transition highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus from the group interaction to the ball itself.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features the main subjects **switching from one to another**, so the description should reflect this by explaining how the transition occurs, whether through subject movement or camera movement.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe caption is very good. It successfully captures the main subjects and the key narrative action of the video while adhering to the core principles of the instructions, such as being concise, objective, and descriptive. It correctly identifies the shift in focus from the group to the basketball.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   The caption is accurate in its description of the scene: a group of seven people on a red sports court in a circle.\n*   It accurately identifies the clothing of several individuals, which is crucial for distinguishing them.\n*   It correctly pinpoints the central event: the basketball moving to the foreground and revealing a face on it.\n\n**Completeness:**\n*   The caption is mostly complete. It describes the initial setup and the main transition, giving a full, albeit brief, summary of the video's content.\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The description of the people is limited to their clothing. The instructions ask for other details like \"skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible).\" If these details are visible in the video, adding them would make the caption more complete. For example, \"a man with short brown hair in a green jacket...\"\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is both. It avoids unnecessary words while providing key information about the subjects and their context.\n*   **Subject-Focused:** It correctly focuses on the people and the basketball, mentioning the background (\"red sports court\") only for necessary context.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It successfully combines the initial scene with the later focus on the ball into a single, coherent narrative, avoiding a frame-by-frame breakdown.\n*   **Language and Tone:** The caption uses simple, natural English and avoids subjective or emotional adjectives (\"unique design\" is on the edge, but it's used to explain the reason for the focus shift, which is acceptable). It also correctly avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Distinguishing Subjects:** It does an excellent job of distinguishing the seven people by their clothing (e.g., \"man in a green jacket,\" \"woman in a purple dress\").\n*   **Describing Transitions:** The caption effectively describes the *narrative* transition: \"The basketball... becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground... shifting the viewer's focus.\" This is a strong point. However, it doesn't describe the *technical* nature of the transition (e.g., a hard cut, a zoom, a camera pan). If the instructions require this level of detail, specifying the type of shot change would be an improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is high-quality and follows the instructions closely. Its main strengths are its clear structure, objective tone, and effective description of the shift in focus. The only minor area for improvement would be to add more physical attributes to the descriptions of the people (if visible) and to be slightly more specific about the mechanics of the video transition.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a group of seven people on a red sports court, engaged in a circle formation. The subjects include a man with short brown hair in a green jacket and white pants holding a basketball, a woman with curly black hair in a purple dress, a man with a beard in an orange hoodie, a man with glasses in a blue jacket, a man with light brown skin in a light blue outfit, a woman with long blonde hair wearing a blue cap, and a man with dark hair in a brown shirt. The basketball, initially held by the man in the green jacket, becomes the focal point as it transitions to the foreground through a smooth zoom, revealing a face imprinted on its surface. This transition highlights the basketball's unique design, shifting the viewer's focus from the group interaction to the ball itself.",
