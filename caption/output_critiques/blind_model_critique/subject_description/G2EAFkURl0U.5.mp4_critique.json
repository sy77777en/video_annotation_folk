    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good, but it could be slightly improved for conciseness and directness. It successfully follows most of the complex instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is accurate. It correctly identifies the content as an \"outdoor scenery shot of a campground\" and accurately lists the key visible elements: \"log cabins,\" \"picnic tables,\" \"fire pits,\" and \"trees.\" It also correctly identifies that there is no single main subject.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is complete. It fulfills the specific instruction for scenery shots by explaining the type of scene, the reason for the lack of a main subject, and the key components that make up the environment.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption adheres well to the provided rules, with only minor areas for improvement.\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Follows the Scenery Shot Rule:** It correctly identifies the video as a scenery shot, explains why there is no main subject (\"the focus is on the overall environment\"), and stays within the one-to-three-sentence guideline for this type of content.\n*   **Avoids Forbidden Terms:** It does not use words like \"image\" or \"frame.\"\n*   **Uses Precise Language:** It uses specific nouns like \"log cabins,\" \"picnic tables,\" and \"fire pits\" instead of vague terms.\n*   **Avoids Subjectivity:** The description is objective and avoids emotional or speculative language.\n*   **Correct Format:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without Markdown or external introductory text.\n*   **Justifies Mentioning Motion:** It mentions the \"slight pan\" but justifies it by explaining its purpose (\"to emphasize the breadth of the setting\"), which is an acceptable exception to the rule against describing motion.\n\n**Areas for Minor Improvement:**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The second sentence is a bit long and explanatory. While it follows the rule to explain *why* there's no main subject, it could be more streamlined.\n*   **Introductory Phrasing:** The caption begins with \"This is an outdoor scenery shot...\". The instructions state to avoid \"introductory text.\" A more direct and immersive description would omit \"This is\" and start with the description itself (e.g., \"An outdoor scenery shot of a wooded campground features...\").\n\n**An improved version adhering more strictly to all rules might look like this:**\n\nAn outdoor scenery shot of a wooded campground features multiple log cabins, picnic tables, and fire pits nestled among trees. The focus is on the overall environment rather than a single subject, with a slight pan across the scene emphasizing the breadth of the setting.",
