    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nFocus on describing the **atypical appearance** of the main subjects in the video. Avoid mentioning the background or subject movements.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and adheres very well to the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and follows the specified formatting and stylistic rules.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subjects as a \"human-like character\" and a \"skeleton,\" which are precise and appropriate descriptions for the characters from the video game *Undertale* (Frisk and Sans) without needing to name them. The visual attributes are described with precision, including the \"purple and blue striped shirt,\" the skeleton's \"blue, unzipped hoodie,\" \"black shorts with white stripes,\" and the \"wide, grinning skull.\" The \"pixelated\" style is a crucial and accurate detail that is correctly included.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures all the salient subjects in the scene—the two characters and the snowball. It provides sufficient detail for each subject, covering their appearance, clothing, and key features, allowing a reader to form a clear mental picture of the scene.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Conciseness and Clarity:** The caption is a concise, single paragraph that is easy to read and understand.\n    *   **Subject Identification:** It uses precise terms (\"human-like character,\" \"skeleton,\" \"snowball\") instead of vague ones.\n    *   **Visual Attributes:** It excels at describing key visual attributes objectively (e.g., \"brown, shoulder-length hair,\" \"yellowish skin,\" \"round, white snowball\").\n    *   **No Subjective Language:** The caption successfully avoids subjective or emotional adjectives. \"Grinning\" is a descriptive term for the skull's shape, not an emotional assessment.\n    *   **Structure and Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any introductory text or Markdown, as instructed. It avoids meta-language like \"frame\" or \"image.\"\n    *   **Handling Multiple Subjects:** It clearly distinguishes between the two characters by their appearance and describes them in a logical order.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly focuses on the subjects and their attributes, only mentioning the snowball's location in relation to a character (\"Near this character rests...\"), which is an appropriate use of relational detail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a model example of a good caption according to the given rules. It is descriptive, objective, and structured perfectly to meet all the requirements of the prompt. There are no significant areas for improvement.",
