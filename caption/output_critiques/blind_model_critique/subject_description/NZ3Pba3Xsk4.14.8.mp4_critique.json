The red panda moves on all fours, occasionally climbing onto a large, horizontal tree branch. Its face is marked with white patches around the eyes and muzzle, and its ears are upright and pointed. The animal’s body is elongated and its tail is held out behind it as it navigates the area. The red panda’s movements are agile and deliberate as it explores its environment.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is very good and adheres closely to the provided instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured.\n\n**Accuracy:**\nThe caption is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"red panda\" and precisely describes its key visual characteristics, such as its \"reddish-brown fur,\" \"bushy ringed tail,\" \"black legs,\" and the distinct \"white patches around the eyes and muzzle.\" The description of its movement and behavior (\"moves on all fours,\" \"climbing\") is also consistent with that of a red panda.\n\n**Completeness:**\nThe description is very complete. It covers the subject's type, its primary physical attributes from head to tail, and its actions within the environment. It successfully creates a holistic picture of the subject by combining details about its appearance and behavior, giving a reader a clear understanding of the video's content.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption demonstrates excellent adherence to the specific rules outlined in the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is direct and packed with relevant information without being overly wordy.\n*   **Focus on Subject:** It focuses entirely on the red panda, its attributes, and its direct interactions (climbing the branch), correctly avoiding unnecessary details about the background.\n*   **Holistic Description:** It describes the animal's general appearance and actions (\"occasionally climbing,\" \"navigates the area\") rather than describing a single static frame.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It uses the precise term \"red panda\" and avoids vague words. It also correctly avoids \"image,\" \"frame,\" or \"video\" within the main descriptive body.\n*   **Detailed Attributes:** It provides specific visual details as requested (fur color, markings, tail appearance, body shape).\n*   **Formatting:** It is a single, coherent paragraph without any Markdown or introductory text, as instructed.\n\n### Minor Points for Improvement\n\nWhile the caption is excellent, there are two very minor points where it could be refined for perfect alignment with the instructions:\n\n1.  **Introductory Phrase:** The caption begins with \"The video features a...\". The instructions ask to \"Return only the one-paragraph video description without... introductory text.\" A more direct approach would be to start immediately with the subject, such as: \"A red panda with reddish-brown fur...\" This is a subtle point, but it would make the caption even more direct.\n2.  **Subjective Adjectives:** The instruction is to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The words \"agile\" and \"deliberate\" could be considered slightly subjective. \"Agile\" describes a quality of movement that is largely observable, but \"deliberate\" implies intent, which is an interpretation. Sticking to purely descriptive terms for movement (e.g., \"steady,\" \"slow,\" \"quick\") would be a stricter adherence to this rule.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is of high quality and effectively fulfills almost all requirements of the detailed instructions. The feedback for improvement is minor and relates to the most nuanced aspects of the rules. Overall, it is a well-crafted and effective description.",
