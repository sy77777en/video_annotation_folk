    "pre_caption": "A group of men are gathered around a teal sedan that has a sunroof and its driver-side doors open. In the center, a man with braided hair stands in front of the car, wearing a grey graphic t-shirt, ripped blue jeans, and black and white sneakers; he gestures toward the camera with both hands. To his left, another man with braided hair sits on the car's hood, dressed in a black hoodie with a blue and white graphic on the chest, black pants, and yellow and black sneakers. He wears a long chain necklace with a blue pendant. The surrounding group of men are mostly dressed in dark clothing, including black hoodies, jackets, and pants. Some wear baseball caps, and one man on the far right is in a black jacket with a red lining, while another wears a black jacket with white designs on the sleeves. The men are positioned around the vehicle, looking toward the central figures and the camera.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nIn addition, the human-written caption below already describes the subjects (if any) in this video, including framing information like shot size. Use this caption as a reference to draft the subject description, but do not rely on it completely. Expand or refine it to fully capture the subject’s type, attributes, appearance, unique features, pose, orientation, relationships between subjects, or any changes in the main focused subject, such as revealing, disappearing, or shifting focus. However, if the description below does not mention any subjects, please do not describe subjects and only specify the type of shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot or a FPV shot) and explain why there is no main subject.\n\nHuman-Written Caption: **The camera transitions from an inverted perspective to a top-down view, then to an eye-level view through a craning-down motion, moving around the car and the surrounding people. The main subject, a singer standing in front of a car surrounded by a group of men, initially appears as a distant headshot. As the camera cranes closer, the shot gradually expands into a full-body view of the singer.**\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption provides a solid foundation by identifying the main subjects and their clothing, but it describes the scene as a static photograph rather than a dynamic video. It misses the opportunity to convey the energy and movement inherent in the scene; for instance, the man's \"gestures\" could be described as rhythmic hand movements synchronized with unheard music, and the other men in the group might be subtly nodding their heads or interacting with each other, which would add life to the description. A significant omission is the lack of any facial expressions or overall mood; the man on the hood could have a confident, direct gaze at the camera, while the gesturing man might have an intense, focused expression, collectively creating an atmosphere of urban swagger that the current text fails to capture. Furthermore, details are left too vague; the \"graphic\" on the hoodie could be a specific, recognizable logo, and the \"white designs\" on the jacket sleeves could be a distinct pattern like chevrons or stripes. Finally, the caption doesn't account for any camera movement, such as a slow pan across the group or a rack focus from the car's emblem to the man on the hood, which would be crucial elements in a video that influence how the subjects are perceived and in what order they gain prominence.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "A group of men are gathered around a teal sedan with a sunroof and its driver-side doors open, creating a lively scene. In the center, a man with braided hair stands in front of the car, wearing a grey graphic t-shirt, ripped blue jeans, and black and white sneakers. He makes rhythmic hand movements, synchronized with the beat of unheard music, adding energy to the moment. His intense, focused expression conveys a sense of urban swagger. To his left, another man with braided hair sits confidently on the car's hood, dressed in a black hoodie featuring a recognizable blue and white logo, black pants, and yellow and black sneakers. He wears a long chain necklace with a blue pendant and gazes directly at the camera with a confident demeanor. The surrounding group of men, mostly in dark clothing like black hoodies, jackets, and pants, subtly nod their heads or interact with each other, enhancing the dynamic atmosphere. Some wear baseball caps, and one man on the far right sports a black jacket with a red lining, while another has a black jacket with distinct white chevron patterns on the sleeves. The camera slowly pans across the group, capturing their interactions and expressions, before a rack focus shifts from the car's emblem to the man on the hood, emphasizing the sequence of prominence in the scene.",
