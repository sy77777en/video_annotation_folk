    "pre_caption": "A man with green-tinged skin, a bald head with graying hair on the sides, and a red shirt is depicted from the chest up behind a desk. On the desk and surrounding interface, several documents are displayed. These include a red passport with a gold emblem, a yellow \"Certificate of Vaccination\" for \"JORJI COSTAVA,\" a white \"M.O.A. CITATION\" with purple text indicating a protocol violation, and a white \"ENTRY VISA\" featuring a photo of a bald, bearded man. To the right, a \"WANTED\" poster shows three headshots. Above this scene, a top-down, pixelated view shows a border crossing with a long queue of black figures on the left and several blue figures on the right. Speech bubbles with text such as \"Papers, please.\" and \"Hello Jorji.\" appear near the man. A large, golden key hangs on the wall next to a small, framed drawing of a red stick figure labeled \"Arstotzka Hero.\"",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features a **complex scenario** with ambiguous subjects or it is an abstract shot. Please try your best to describe the main subjects or objects in the video.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption accurately identifies many specific objects from the game \"Papers, Please,\" such as Jorji Costava's documents and the \"Arstotzka Hero\" drawing, but it misinterprets the scene's central subject and action. The description of \"a man with green-tinged skin\" behind a desk is confusing; the video likely shows this man, who is the entrant Jorji Costava, standing *at* the counter, not behind it. The perspective is that of the inspector, whose hands would be visible moving the documents, an element the caption omits. The caption also describes the scene statically, using phrases like \"is depicted\" and \"are displayed,\" whereas the video would dynamically show Jorji presenting his papers and the inspector examining them, with dialogue bubbles appearing sequentially. Furthermore, the top-down view of the queue is not a separate scene but a persistent part of the game's interface, and describing it as such would be more accurate than implying a shot change. The caption misses the opportunity to describe the core gameplay loop, such as the inspector using the iconic red and green approval/denial stamps, and it fails to note the crucial discrepancy between Jorji's appearance and the photo on his visa, which is a central point of the interaction shown.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video shows the iconic gameplay of \"Papers, Please,\" where the player acts as the border inspector. The scene features Jorji Costava, a character with green-tinged skin and a bald head, standing at the counter presenting his documents. The inspector's hands are visible, moving various papers, including Jorji's red passport, a yellow \"Certificate of Vaccination,\" and a white \"ENTRY VISA\" with a photo that doesn't match Jorji's appearance, highlighting a key discrepancy. The inspector examines these documents while dialogue bubbles appear sequentially, with phrases like \"Papers, please.\" and \"Hello Jorji.\" The interface includes a persistent top-down view of the border crossing, showing a queue of black figures on the left and blue figures on the right. The inspector uses the red and green stamps to approve or deny entry, a core part of the gameplay loop. On the wall, a large golden key and a framed drawing labeled \"Arstotzka Hero\" add to the scene's detail.",
