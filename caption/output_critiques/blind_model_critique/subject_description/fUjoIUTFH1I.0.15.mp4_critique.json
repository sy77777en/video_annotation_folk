    "pre_caption": "This video is a quiet cityscape scenery shot of a street in what appears to be the French Quarter of New Orleans, enveloped in a thick, gray fog. There is no main subject, as the focus is on the moody, still atmosphere of the environment. Muted gray and brick buildings with characteristic wrought-iron balconies, adorned with hanging flower baskets, line the wet, empty street. The dense fog softens the architectural details in the distance, creating a sense of quiet solitude and emphasizing the classic design of the buildings in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the scene as a foggy cityscape in the French Quarter, it deviates significantly from the core instructions by using subjective and interpretive language such as \"beautifully captures,\" \"serene,\" \"picturesque,\" and \"moody.\" The instructions explicitly forbid such emotional descriptors. Furthermore, the caption misses opportunities for greater specificity; for example, instead of just \"muted gray and brick buildings,\" it could have noted the specific red brick construction with dark green shutters and the ornate, black wrought-iron of the balconies. The video likely shows vibrant purple flowers in the hanging baskets, which would be a key visual detail to contrast with the otherwise muted palette. The caption also includes analytical commentary like \"enhancing the overall composition,\" which is outside the scope of a purely descriptive task. It may have also overlooked a more salient object, such as a prominent, glowing, old-fashioned streetlamp in the midground, which would be a more important focal point to describe than the partially obscured car roof mentioned in the bottom corner. A better caption would eliminate all subjective analysis and instead provide a more direct, objective inventory of the scene, focusing on concrete visual attributes like specific colors and architectural features to paint a clearer picture.",
