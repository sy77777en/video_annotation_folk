    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video it describes. It perfectly adheres to the provided instructions by being accurate, complete, and well-structured.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible video scene. It identifies the key elements (\"cityscape,\" \"waterfront,\" \"historic buildings,\" \"fog,\" \"water,\" \"stone walkway\") and their visual attributes (\"misty,\" \"partially obscured,\" \"deep blue-green,\" \"gently rippling\") in a way that creates a clear mental picture.\n\n### Completeness\nThe description is comprehensive. It not only details the visual components of the scene but also captures the overall mood and context, which is crucial for a scenery shot. It successfully explains *why* the shot is framed the way it isâ€”to emphasize atmosphere and scale over a single subject.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows every rule meticulously:\n\n*   **Scenery Shot Protocol:** It correctly identifies the video as a \"cityscape scenery shot\" and follows the specific instructions for this type of content. It provides a concise, one-paragraph description of the environment.\n*   **Explanation for No Main Subject:** It includes a clear, two-sentence explanation for the absence of a main subject, as required: \"The atmosphere is tranquil... highlighting the interplay between architecture, water, and weather.\" This perfectly fits the \"one to three sentences\" rule.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The description is brief yet packed with essential details about the scene's composition and mood.\n*   **Objective Language:** While it uses atmospheric words like \"tranquil\" and \"mysterious,\" it does so in accordance with the instruction to describe the \"environment, atmosphere, or scale\" for scenery shots. It correctly links these descriptors to visual evidence (\"due to the haze\") rather than assigning unsubstantiated emotions.\n*   **Formatting and Wording:** It is a single, coherent paragraph, uses simple and natural English, and avoids forbidden terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" It also correctly describes motion where necessary (\"gently rippling\") to define the state of a subject (the water).",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a serene cityscape scene featuring a misty waterfront, where historic buildings line the opposite shore, their facades partially veiled by fog. The foreground showcases a deep blue-green water, gently rippling, bordered by a stone walkway that gracefully curves along the edge. The tranquil and slightly mysterious atmosphere, enhanced by the haze, emphasizes the vastness and ambiance of the urban landscape, focusing on the harmonious interplay between architecture, water, and weather rather than any individual subject.",
