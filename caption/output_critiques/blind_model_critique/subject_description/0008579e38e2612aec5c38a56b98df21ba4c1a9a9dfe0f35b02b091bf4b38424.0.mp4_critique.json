    "pre_caption": "Three women stand close together under pink and blue lighting. The woman on the left has dark hair and wears a pink double-breasted blazer dress, a large earring, and black heeled sandals. The woman in the center, with long dark hair, smiles while wearing a black and white polka-dot top under a white blazer with white trousers and black heeled sandals. The woman on the right has long, light brown hair and wears a pink, short-sleeved, pleated dress with pink heeled sandals. The woman on the left has a black prosthetic left leg with intricate patterns on it.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple different subjects in focus**, so the description should clearly distinguish their types and relationships.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the three women and their attire, it describes the scene as if it were a static photograph, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the video. For instance, the video shows the women interacting warmly; the woman in the center gently places her hand on the left woman's shoulder as they all share a laugh, a detail that adds a layer of connection missing from the description. The caption also mentions the prosthetic leg as an afterthought, whereas the video gives it prominence through a slow pan that begins at the woman's heeled sandal and travels up to highlight the beautiful, laser-etched floral design on the black prosthetic, celebrating it as a key part of her stylish ensemble. Furthermore, while the center woman's smile is noted, the caption omits that the woman on the left has a confident, soft smile and the woman on the right is looking at the center woman with a joyful expression. Finally, the description of the \"large earring\" is vague; the video's close-up reveals it to be a single, geometric, gold-plated piece that catches the pink light, a specific detail that would enhance the description.",

The woman on the left, with dark hair, wears a pink double-breasted blazer dress, complemented by a striking geometric, gold-plated earring that catches the pink light. Her confident, soft smile adds to her presence, as does her black prosthetic left leg, which is celebrated in the video with a slow pan highlighting its intricate, laser-etched floral design. The woman in the center, with long dark hair, wears a black and white polka-dot top under a white blazer with white trousers and black heeled sandals. She gently places her hand on the left woman's shoulder, sharing a laugh that lights up her face. The woman on the right, with long light brown hair, wears a pink, short-sleeved, pleated dress with matching pink heeled sandals.
