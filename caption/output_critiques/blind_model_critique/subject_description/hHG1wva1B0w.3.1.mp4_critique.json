    "pre_caption": "The video features a classic car with a rounded, vintage design, reminiscent of mid-20th-century models. It has a smooth, beige exterior with distinct curves and a compact body. The car's front is characterized by round headlights and a simple bumper, while the side view reveals a two-door configuration with rounded windows. The wheels are partially visible, and the overall appearance is sleek and well-maintained, highlighting its timeless design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed feedback on the caption:\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully follows several key instructions but fails on a few important points, particularly regarding objectivity and the description of transitions.\n\n### Accuracy and Completeness:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption appears to be accurate in its description of the subject. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"classic car\" and provides specific, verifiable visual details like its \"beige exterior,\" \"round headlights,\" and \"two-door configuration.\"\n*   **Completeness:** The description is quite comprehensive, covering the car's overall design, color, shape, and specific features from both the front and side. However, it may be incomplete if the video contains distinct shot transitions. By mentioning a \"front\" and \"side view,\" the caption implies a change in perspective, but it fails to describe *how* the video moves between these views (e.g., via a hard cut, a pan, or a soft transition), which is a specific requirement of the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n\n**What the caption does well:**\n\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It provides a clear and focused description of the car in a single, coherent paragraph.\n*   **Subject Identification:** It uses a precise term, \"classic car,\" to identify the subject.\n*   **Attribute Description:** It effectively describes key visual attributes like color (\"beige\"), shape (\"rounded,\" \"distinct curves,\" \"compact body\"), and specific features (\"round headlights,\" \"simple bumper\").\n*   **Holistic View:** It successfully combines details from different parts of the video (\"front,\" \"side view\") into a unified description without referring to specific frames.\n*   **Formatting:** It adheres to the single-paragraph format without any introductory text or Markdown.\n\n**Where the caption fails:**\n\n*   **Use of Subjective Language:** The most significant violation is the use of subjective language. The instruction explicitly states to \"avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions.\" The phrase **\"timeless design\"** is a subjective judgment of the car's aesthetic value, not a visual description. Similarly, \"sleek\" and \"well-maintained\" are interpretive, though \"well-maintained\" could be argued as an observation of the car's condition (e.g., lack of rust, shiny paint).\n*   **Inference vs. Observation:** The phrase **\"reminiscent of mid-20th-century models\"** is an inference based on the car's style. While likely correct, the instructions emphasize describing what is directly visible. A more compliant caption would stick to describing its \"vintage design\" without speculating on the specific era.\n*   **Missing Shot Transitions:** As mentioned under \"Completeness,\" the caption fails to describe any shot transitions, which is a mandatory part of the instructions if they occur. Describing the \"front\" and \"side view\" without explaining how the video presents them is an omission.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a classic car with a rounded, vintage design. It features a smooth, beige exterior with distinct curves and a compact body. The car's front is marked by round headlights and a simple bumper, while the side view reveals a two-door configuration with rounded windows. The video transitions from the front to the side view with a smooth pan, allowing a clear view of the car's partially visible wheels and overall well-preserved condition.",
