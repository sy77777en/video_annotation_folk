    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide-angle cityscape scenery shot of a grand, semicircular courtyard at night. There is no single main subject, as the slow, pulling-back camera movement is designed to capture the impressive scale and atmosphere of the entire architectural space. The scene is dominated by a large, multi-story building with a curved facade, brilliantly illuminated by warm, yellow lights that highlight its classical details, numerous windows, and balconies. In the center of the cobblestone square stands a dark, bronze equestrian statue on a stone plinth. To the right, a prominent red neon sign for the \"THEATRE EDOUARD VII\" glows above an entrance flanked by red umbrellas and outdoor seating, while the ground-floor colonnade is lit with a cooler, greenish-white light, creating a striking visual contrast.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subjects, it includes subjective language and cinematic analysis that should be omitted. Terms like \"grand,\" \"impressive,\" \"lively,\" and \"serene\" are interpretive and violate the instruction to avoid emotional adjectives. The description of the camera movement (\"arcs counterclockwise\") is an analysis of the cinematography, not a description of the subjects themselves. The caption also misses key visual details that would be apparent in the video. For instance, the \"fast-moving crowd\" would likely appear as blurred streaks of motion in a nighttime long exposure or time-lapse, a visual characteristic that should be described instead of their inferred action of \"navigating.\" The \"equestrian statue\" could be described with more specificity, such as noting if the horse is rearing and if the rider is wearing a military-style hat. Furthermore, the description of the \"outdoor seating\" is vague; it could be specified as empty, black wrought-iron tables and chairs arranged under the red umbrellas. Finally, a video of this nature would almost certainly feature the light trails of moving vehicles on the cobblestone streets, a salient visual element that is completely missing from the description. The caption should be revised to focus strictly on the objective, visual attributes of the subjects, starting with the dominant building and then detailing the statue, theatre signage, and the motion-blurred people and vehicles.",
