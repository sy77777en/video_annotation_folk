    "pre_caption": "This video presents a wide cityscape scenery shot, capturing an iconic view in London. The composition is split by a large, light-colored stone pillar in the foreground, creating a striking contrast between two scenes. To the left, a contemporary white sculpture with numerous spires stands against a partly cloudy sky. To the right, a sun-drenched, empty road stretches towards the majestic Buckingham Palace in the distance, with the golden-winged statue of the Victoria Memorial visible before it. There is no main subject, as the expansive, static perspective is designed to emphasize the architectural grandeur and the atmosphere of the famous location, focusing on the sense of place rather than a particular person or object.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "The video is a scenery shot. You do not need to describe the subject. Please concisely specify the type of scenery shot (e.g., a landscape or cityscape scenery shot) in a single fluent paragraph.Also explain why there is no main subject, such as the focus being on the environment, atmosphere, or scale rather than a specific object. Just note that briefly in one to three sentences.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the split composition and the key landmarks like Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial, it oversimplifies several key visual elements and misses details that add context and authenticity to the scene. The description of the road as \"empty\" is inaccurate; in the video, a classic red double-decker bus is visible driving away from the palace in the distance, and a few black cabs are scattered along its length, reinforcing the London setting. The \"upright frame displaying a photograph\" is actually a weathered bronze informational stand, featuring an engraved map of the St. James's Park area, which a couple of tourists are briefly seen observing on the left. The caption also fails to mention the prominent, leafy London Plane trees that line both sides of the road, whose long, diagonal shadows stretch across the asphalt, indicating the footage was captured in the late afternoon. Furthermore, the \"large, light-colored stone pillar\" in the foreground is not plain; it has a textured, slightly grimy surface from weathering and features a carved, but now illegible, inscription at its base, which the camera slowly pans past. A more accurate caption would incorporate these specific details about the traffic, the informational stand, the trees, and the pillar's texture to create a richer and more faithful description of the video's content.",
