    "pre_caption": "The video shows a black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan parked in an outdoor paved area marked with white lines.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. You should describe the video by combining details from the frames without referring to any specific one (e.g., don’t mention things like \"first frame\" or \"last frame\"), and avoid using terms like \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the one-paragraph video description without Markdown formatting or introductory text.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features salient **non-human** subjects, so the description should focus on them.\n\nPlease avoid using phrases like \"the first frame\" or \"the last frame\" in your description. Instead, refer to the entire sequence simply as \"the video.\" Your description should integrate observations from all frames into a cohesive, temporally and logically consistent narrative, rather than describing frames in isolation. Whenever you mention a subject, be sure to include detailed descriptions of its key visual attributes. The final output should be a single, fluent paragraph describing the video, with no Markdown formatting or introductory text. Don't mention the surroundings or the subject's motion unless necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationship.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent caption that is highly accurate and detailed, but it has two minor deviations from the instructions.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:** The caption is extremely accurate. It correctly identifies the subject as a \"black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan\" and precisely describes its key visual attributes, including the \"light tan or beige interior,\" \"silver, multi-spoke alloy wheels,\" and the fact that all four doors are open. The description of the setting as an \"outdoor paved area marked with white lines\" is also correct.\n\n**Completeness:** The description is very complete. It captures all the essential information about the subject, providing enough detail for a reader to form a clear mental picture of the car and its state without being overly long.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions:** The caption adheres to most of the instructions very well, but there are two small areas for improvement:\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It is a concise, clear, and coherent paragraph.\n    *   It focuses on the subject's type and visual attributes using specific, objective language.\n    *   It avoids subjective adjectives, speculation, and references to specific frames.\n    *   It correctly identifies the subject with a precise term (\"Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan\").\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    1.  **Meta-Language:** The caption begins with \"The video shows...\". The instructions require avoiding meta-terms and describing the scene directly. A better approach would be to start the sentence with the subject itself, for example: \"A black Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan is parked...\"\n    2.  **Perspective vs. Orientation:** The caption describes the camera's perspective (\"viewed from a low angle\") rather than the subject's orientation. The instructions ask for the subject's pose and orientation. While the information is useful, it could be rephrased to focus on the car, such as: \"The car is angled slightly away from the viewer...\"\n\nOverall, the caption is very good and effectively communicates the visual information. The minor deviations are stylistic and do not detract from the caption's clarity or accuracy.",
