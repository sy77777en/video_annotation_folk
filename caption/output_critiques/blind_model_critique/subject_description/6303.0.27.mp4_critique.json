    "pre_caption": "The video features a basketball court scene with a unique basketball as the main subject. The basketball, positioned prominently in the foreground, has a human face with expressive features, including eyes and a mouth, giving it a surreal appearance. In the background, several people are playing basketball. They are dressed in casual sportswear, with one person wearing a green jacket and white pants, and another in a blue top. The players are engaged in the game, adding dynamic movement to the scene. The court is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls, enhancing the urban setting. The focus remains on the animated basketball, which stands out due to its unusual and eye-catching design.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the subjects in this video. Keep the description concise and clear, focusing on subject types and visual attributes. Since this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Don't mention the background or motion unless it's necessary to distinguish subjects by location, action, or relationships. You must avoid describing what is not visible or what you are unsure about. You must use simple, natural English and ensure the description is a clear, concise, and coherent paragraph that highlights the most essential details. You must avoid subjective adjectives that convey emotions. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail. Return only the description.\n\nClearly identify each subject’s type, using precise terms such as “man,” “woman,” “dog,” “car,” or “tree,” rather than vague words like “thing” or “item.” If the subject type is ambiguous, use your best judgment and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\nDescribe key visual attributes with specific and descriptive language. For people, include details such as clothing color and style, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, age (if discernible), gender, ethnicity (if relevant and clear), and facial expression. For objects, describe their color, material, shape, and distinguishing features like texture or markings. Additionally, note the subject’s pose and orientation within the frame, such as standing, sitting, walking, or facing a certain direction. Pay attention to any objects that are not in their usual state, like a tilted lamp or an open book lying face down.\n\nIf there are multiple subjects to describe, ensure clarity in referring to each. The simplest way is by type, such as “the man,” “the dog,” or “the tree.” If multiple subjects belong to the same category, distinguish them using unique appearance traits (e.g., “the woman in the red dress,” “the man with the beard”), location within the scene (e.g., “the man on the left,” “the car in the midground”), actions (e.g., “the child playing with a ball,” “the bird flying”), or relationships to each other (e.g., “the man next to the woman,” “the first man that enters the frame”). Also, when describing multiple subjects, the order in which they are mentioned matters. Prioritize based on relevance, starting with the largest or most centered subject. If the scene unfolds over time, describe subjects in the order they appear. If temporal order isn’t relevant, begin with the most visually striking or important subject before moving to less prominent ones. The goal is to provide enough detail so that anyone reading the description can easily identify each subject.\n\nPlease note that the video features **multiple subjects with one clear main focus**, so you need to clarify who the main subject is. The description should focus on the details of the main subject while concisely summarizing secondary subjects and describing their relationship to the main subject if clear.\n\nSince this is the first and last frame of a video, refer to it as \"The video\" instead of mentioning \"image\" or \"frame.\" Don't use terms like \"the first frame\", \"the last frame\".  Describe the entire video by combining details from both frames, rather than describing them separately. Whenever you mention a subject, please describe its key visual attributes in detail.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the main subject as a basketball with a human face and notes the background activity, it makes several assumptions and lacks crucial details that would be present in the video. The term \"animated\" is a significant overstatement if the basketball's facial features are static, which is more likely; a more accurate description would be that it is \"painted\" or \"sculpted\" with a face. The description of the face having \"expressive features\" is subjective; it would be better to describe the actual expression, such as \"wide eyes and a slightly open mouth.\" The most critical omission is the relationship between the unique basketball and the players. The caption fails to clarify if the players are using this specific ball or if it is merely a static prop in the foreground while they play with a standard basketball in the background, a distinction that fundamentally changes the context of the scene. Furthermore, describing the players as \"several people\" is vague; specifying the number (e.g., \"two men\") and their specific actions (e.g., \"one man in a green jacket attempts a layup while another in a blue top defends\") would provide much-needed clarity instead of the generic \"engaged in the game.\" Finally, the use of subjective words like \"surreal\" and \"eye-catching\" should be avoided in favor of objective descriptions that allow the reader to form their own conclusions.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a basketball court scene where a basketball with a human face is prominently positioned in the foreground. The basketball appears to be painted or sculpted with wide eyes and a slightly open mouth. In the background, two men are playing basketball; one is wearing a green jacket and white pants, attempting a layup, while the other, in a blue top, defends. It is unclear if the players are using the unique basketball or a standard one. The court is surrounded by graffiti-covered walls, contributing to the urban atmosphere. The focus remains on the basketball with its distinctive design.",
