    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It accurately identifies several key cinematic elements and is concise. However, it makes one significant oversimplification regarding camera movement, which prevents it from being completely accurate and fully adherent to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **What it gets right:**\n    *   **Low-angle shot:** Correct. The camera is positioned below the subject's eye line and is angled upward, making him appear more prominent.\n    *   **Filmed from hip level:** Correct. This is a very reasonable estimation of the camera's physical height.\n    *   **Shallow depth of field:** Correct. The subject (the man) is in sharp focus, while the background (the building and sky) is clearly and intentionally blurred.\n    *   **Focus fixed on the man... in the midground:** Correct. The focus plane is locked on the man, who is positioned in the midground of the frame. There are no focus changes.\n\n*   **What it gets wrong:**\n    *   **\"Static\" shot:** This is inaccurate. While the camera is not performing any deliberate movements like panning or tilting, it is not perfectly still. There is a very subtle but noticeable **handheld wobble or sway** throughout the video. A truly static shot would be completely motionless, as if mounted on a tripod.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   The caption is commendably concise, as requested. It successfully covers angle, height, and focus.\n*   However, it is incomplete because it fails to describe the camera's lack of perfect stability. The instructions specifically ask to describe \"steadiness\" and mention if the camera is \"shaking or wobbling.\" By labeling the shot as \"static,\" the caption omits this important detail.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instruction**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly follows the instruction to be **concise**.\n    *   It correctly omits details that are not present (video speed is normal, no lens distortion, no Dutch angle).\n    *   It correctly describes the **camera angle**, **camera height**, and **focus/depth of field** as required.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   It fails to adhere to the instruction regarding movement: **\"If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe).\"** The caption should have noted the minimal wobble instead of calling the shot static.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n**This is a nearly static, low-angle shot filmed from hip level, with minimal handheld sway. It uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the man in the midground.**\n\n**Why this is better:**\n*   **More Precise:** It replaces the inaccurate term \"static\" with \"nearly static\" and adds \"with minimal handheld sway.\"\n*   **Fully Adherent:** This change directly addresses the instruction to describe the camera's steadiness and any wobbling, making the description complete and fully compliant.",
