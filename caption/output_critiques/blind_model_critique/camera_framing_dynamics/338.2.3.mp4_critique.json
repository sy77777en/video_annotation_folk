    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of \"eye level with a level angle\" is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned at the subject's head height and is not tilted up or down.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption correctly identifies a \"shallow depth of field,\" which is evident from the sharp focus on the woman and the blurred background. It also correctly places her in the \"midground.\"\n*   **Camera Movement and Steadiness:** The phrase \"fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\" is a precise and nuanced description. The camera's framing does not change, so it is \"fixed\" in terms of position, but the minor, high-frequency shake indicates it is handheld and \"slightly unsteady.\"\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects of the video's configuration as required by the instructions: camera height, angle, focus (depth and plane), and movement (steadiness and type).\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present or are standard (e.g., regular video speed, no lens distortion, no Dutch angle), which adheres to the instruction to be concise.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption is a single, well-structured sentence that conveys all the necessary technical information without being verbose.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specific terminology requested in the instructions (e.g., \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground\").\n*   **Comprehensive Description:** It provides a complete picture of the shot's technical setup, fulfilling the core requirement of the prompt.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and uses the correct technical language to create a concise yet thorough description of the video's camera configuration.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a woman in the midground with a camera positioned at eye level and a level angle, utilizing a shallow depth of field for sharp focus on her while the background remains blurred. The camera is fixed but exhibits slight unsteadiness, indicating handheld use without intentional movement.",
