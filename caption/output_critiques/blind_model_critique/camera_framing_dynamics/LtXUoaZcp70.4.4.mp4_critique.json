    "pre_caption": "This is an eye-level, level-angle shot focusing on a blue, porous statue of a man in a military uniform. The camera performs a smooth dolly-out, moving backward to reveal more of the scene. Initially, the focus appears deep, but as the camera pulls back, the foreground becomes blurry, indicating a shallow depth of field, though the dark background makes the precise focus plane difficult to determine.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** Initially, the camera seems to be in deep focus, but as the camera moves backward, more of the scene is revealed, and the foreground becomes blurry. It's still hard to determine the focus plane due to the dark background. \n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the focus and depth of field. While it correctly identifies the camera's position and movement using proper terminology, its analysis of the focus is flawed.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** `eye-level, level-angle shot` is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned straight-on and at a height corresponding to the statue's upper body.\n    *   **Subject Description:** `blue, porous statue of a man in a military uniform` is a correct and descriptive summary of the subject.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** `smooth dolly-out, moving backward to reveal more of the scene` is an excellent and precise description. It correctly identifies the movement type (dolly-out), its steadiness (smooth), and its purpose (to reveal).\n\n*   **Inaccurate Elements:**\n    *   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is the main point of failure. The caption states, *\"Initially, the focus appears deep, but as the camera pulls back... [it indicates] a shallow depth of field.\"*\n        *   **Correction:** The shot has a **shallow depth of field from the very beginning.** The key indicator is that the background is completely black and blurred out, even when the camera is close to the statue. Deep focus would render the background with some discernible detail. The focus does not *become* shallow; it *is* shallow throughout the entire clip.\n    *   **Focus Plane:** The caption claims `the dark background makes the precise focus plane difficult to determine.`\n        *   **Correction:** The focus plane is very clearly and consistently on the statue (the midground subject). The fact that the statue remains perfectly sharp while the background is a soft blur makes the focus plane easy to identify.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the required elements: camera angle, height, movement (type, steadiness, purpose), and focus.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as video speed alterations, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n*   However, the description of the focus, while present, is incomplete because it is based on a misunderstanding of the visual information. It fails to note that the focus is consistently shallow.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary words.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified technical terms correctly (e.g., `dolly-out`, `level-angle`, `depth of field`).\n*   **Structure:** It follows a logical flow, describing the initial setup and then the movement.\n*   **Omission of \"Normal\" Attributes:** It correctly follows the rule of not mentioning that the video is at regular speed or has no lens distortion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because its central observation about the video's focus is factually incorrect. While it excels in describing the camera's physical position and movement, the flawed analysis of the depth of field undermines its overall quality and usefulness as an informative description.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a caption that accurately reflects the video according to your instructions:\n\n\"**An eye-level, level-angle shot features a smooth and slow dolly-out, moving backward from a blue, porous statue of a man in a military uniform. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field throughout, keeping the statue in sharp focus while the dark background remains completely blurred. The focus plane is consistently on the midground subject.**\"",
