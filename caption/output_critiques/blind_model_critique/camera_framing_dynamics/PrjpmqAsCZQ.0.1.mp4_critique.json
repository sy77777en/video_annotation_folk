    "pre_caption": "The video features a handheld camera positioned at hip level, capturing a man from a low angle with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** It's likely deep focus, but the low resolution makes it difficult to determine the focus type.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera tilts up and down erratically, trying to focus on the man.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is very good and captures the most critical aspects of the video accurately and concisely.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance based on your instructions:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a handheld camera positioned at hip level, capturing a man from a low angle with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. The camera exhibits unsteady, erratic tilting up and down as it attempts to focus on the man. The focus is likely deep, though the low resolution makes it difficult to confirm.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\n*   **\"handheld camera\"**: **Correct.** The unsteady, shaky motion is characteristic of a handheld shot.\n*   **\"positioned at hip level\"**: **Correct.** The camera is very low relative to the subject. \"Hip-level\" is an accurate estimation.\n*   **\"capturing a man from a low angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is clearly looking up at the subject.\n*   **\"varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling\"**: **Perfect.** This is a sophisticated and accurate observation. You correctly identify not just the tilted horizon (Dutch angle) but also that it's *varying* and correctly attribute it to the *rolling* motion of the camera.\n*   **\"unsteady, erratic tilting up and down\"**: **Correct.** This is the most prominent movement, and your description is precise.\n*   **\"attempts to focus on the man\"**: This is the only minor point of inaccuracy. The movement is an attempt to **frame** the man or keep him in the shot, not an attempt to adjust the optical focus. The term \"focus\" in this context is ambiguous. A better phrase would be \"attempts to keep the man in frame.\"\n*   **\"focus is likely deep, though the low resolution makes it difficult to confirm\"**: **Excellent.** This is a very sharp observation. You correctly note that the background and foreground have a similar level of clarity (or lack thereof) suggesting deep focus, but you wisely qualify this statement due to the poor video quality, which is the correct and professional way to handle ambiguity.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Good\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most important elements: **camera height, angle, steadiness, and primary movements (tilting, rolling).** It also addresses **focus** as best as possible.\n*   **What's missing?** The instructions ask for a description of all movements. The camera also performs slight **panning** (rotating left and right) in addition to tilting and rolling. While \"erratic\" covers this generally, explicitly mentioning the combination of movements would be more complete.\n*   It correctly omits mentions of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, and **shot transitions** as they are not present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary information, as instructed.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified technical terms (low angle, Dutch angle, rolling, tilting) correctly and effectively.\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the information, starting with the camera's static configuration (height, angle) before describing its dynamic properties (movement, focus).\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nThe caption is already strong, but it could be perfected by refining the description of the movement's purpose and adding the missing \"panning\" motion.\n\n**Revised Caption for Perfection:**\n\n> A handheld camera at hip-level captures a man from a low angle. The camera movement is unsteady and erratic, characterized by constant tilting up and down, slight panning, and rolling that creates a varying Dutch angle as it struggles to keep the subject framed. Due to the video's low resolution, the depth of field is difficult to determine but appears to be deep, with no discernible focus changes.",
