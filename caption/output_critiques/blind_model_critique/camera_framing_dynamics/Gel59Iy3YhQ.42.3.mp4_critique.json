    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **accurate** in its description of the camera movement but is **highly incomplete** and therefore **does not adhere** to the detailed instructions provided. It successfully identifies the core action but omits the majority of the required descriptive elements.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n**The caption is 100% accurate.**\n*   **\"slow and smooth\"**: The camera's movement is indeed slow, consistent, and perfectly steady, without any shake or wobble.\n*   **\"forward dolly movement\"**: This is the correct technical term for the camera moving physically forward on a straight axis.\n*   **\"through a hallway\"**: This accurately describes the setting.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n**The caption is incomplete.** It only describes the camera's movement and speed, leaving out several key aspects required by the instructions.\n\n**What's missing:**\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption fails to mention that the shot is filmed from a **level angle** at approximately **eye-level**.\n*   **Steadiness:** While \"smooth\" implies steadiness, the instructions ask for a more explicit description. The movement is **perfectly steady**, suggesting professional equipment like a dolly track or a gimbal, or that it is a CGI render.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a significant omission. The video clearly uses **deep focus**, where everything from the foreground to the background is sharp and in focus. There are no focus changes.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The caption doesn't describe the purpose of the movement, which is to guide the viewer through the space and create a sense of clean, methodical progression.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\n\n**The caption does not adhere to the instructions.** The instructions ask for a \"concise yet **informative** description\" covering a specific list of attributes. The caption prioritizes conciseness to the point of omitting required information.\n\n*   It **correctly omits** details that are not present (e.g., video speed alteration, lens distortion, Dutch angle), which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n*   However, it **fails to include** mandatory details that *are* present in the video, such as camera angle, height, and focus characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that adheres to all the instructions by being both concise and informative:\n\n**\"Filmed from a steady, eye-level perspective with a level angle, this shot features a slow forward dolly through a hallway. A deep focus keeps the entire scene perfectly sharp, from the immediate foreground to the far end of the corridor.\"**",
