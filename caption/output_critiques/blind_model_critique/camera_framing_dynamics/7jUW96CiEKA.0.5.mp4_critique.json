    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt at being concise and uses some of the correct terminology. However, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera angle and, most importantly, the depth of field, which misrepresents the visual characteristics of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"The camera is positioned above water\" is accurate.\n    *   **Subject:** \"focusing on a crocodile on the riverbank\" is a correct description of the content.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** \"The camera remains completely static, with no movement or shaking\" is perfectly accurate. The shot is fixed and stable.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption states the camera is at a \"level angle.\" This is **inaccurate**. A level angle would mean the camera is parallel to the ground and at the same height as the subject. Here, the camera is clearly looking slightly *down* on the crocodile, making it a **slight high angle**.\n    *   **Focus / Depth of Field:** This is the most significant error. The caption claims the shot \"employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene sharp.\" This is **inaccurate**. The video clearly exhibits a **shallow depth of field**. The crocodile in the midground is in sharp focus, but the foliage and trees in the background are noticeably blurred and out of focus. Deep focus would render both the foreground and background elements with equal clarity.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the key aspects requested: camera height, angle, focus, and movement.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as video speed alterations, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n*   While it attempts to describe the focus, its description is wrong, making it functionally incomplete as it fails to provide the correct information.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and to the point.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology (e.g., \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"static\"). The problem is not the choice of terms but their incorrect application to the video.\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** The caption correctly avoids stating \"the video is at regular speed\" or \"there is no lens distortion,\" following the rule to only mention features that are present or altered.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately describes the video according to your instructions:\n\n**This is a static shot from a slight high angle, positioned just above the water. The camera utilizes a shallow depth of field, holding focus on the crocodile in the midground while the background foliage appears soft and blurred.**",
