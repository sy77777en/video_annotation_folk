    "pre_caption": "This eye-level, level-angle shot begins with a computer screen in deep focus. The camera, exhibiting smooth but minor wobbling, then pulls back quickly.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video begins with a computer screen in deep focus. As the camera pulls back, the scene reveals a person looking at the screens through window blinds. The person and screens become blurred, while the blinds remain relatively sharp. In the foreground, a wall-like object is blurry.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains mostly stationary with minor wobbling throughout the video, then quickly moves backward at the very end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good** but contains one significant technical inaccuracy. It is well-structured, concise, and successfully describes most of the complex camera actions and focus changes. It adheres well to the instructions by omitting unnecessary information (like normal video speed and lack of distortion).\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy: **Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** `eye-level, level-angle` is a correct and precise description of the initial framing.\n    *   **Camera Movement & Steadiness:** `pulls back quickly` accurately describes the direction (dolly out) and speed of the movement. `smooth but minor wobbling` is an excellent and nuanced description of the shot's steadiness.\n    *   **Focus Change Description:** The description of *what* becomes blurry (`the screen and a person`) and *what* becomes sharp (`the blinds themselves remain relatively sharp`) is highly accurate and detailed. Identifying the `blurry object... in the foreground` is also a great observation.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   **Incorrect Use of \"Deep Focus\":** This is the main error. **Deep focus** means that elements in the foreground, midground, and background are all simultaneously in sharp focus. The caption states the shot *begins* with the screen in deep focus, but the subsequent description of a focus shift contradicts this. The shot actually begins with a **shallow depth of field**, with the focus plane set on the computer screen in the background.\n\n#### Completeness: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** Covered.\n*   **Movements:** Type (`pulls back`), speed (`quickly`), and steadiness (`smooth but minor wobbling`) are all included.\n*   **Focus:** The initial focus plane (`computer screen`), the dynamic change (`focus shifts`), and the resulting state of focus are all described in detail.\n*   **Conciseness:** It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, assuming they are standard/absent, which is exactly what the instructions requested.\n\n#### Adherence to Instruction: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption follows the instructions almost perfectly. It provides a concise yet informative description of the camera's configuration and movement. It breaks down the action chronologically (start -> movement -> focus change) and uses descriptive language to explain complex visual changes. The only deviation is the technical misuse of \"deep focus.\"\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that corrects the inaccuracy and uses slightly more precise terminology, making it a perfect example.\n\n**\"This eye-level, level-angle shot begins with a shallow depth of field, focusing on a computer screen in the background. The camera, exhibiting smooth but minor wobbling, then dollies out quickly. As it moves, a rack focus pulls the focus plane to the window blinds in the midground, leaving the screen and a person behind the blinds blurry. A blurry object remains out of focus in the foreground.\"**\n\n**Changes Explained:**\n*   \"deep focus\" is corrected to **\"shallow depth of field, focusing on a computer screen in the background.\"** This is technically accurate.\n*   \"pulls back\" is refined to **\"dollies out,\"** which is the more specific term for the camera moving backward.\n*   \"the focus shifts\" is made more precise with **\"a rack focus pulls the focus plane to the window blinds in the midground,\"** clearly defining the type of focus change and its target.",
