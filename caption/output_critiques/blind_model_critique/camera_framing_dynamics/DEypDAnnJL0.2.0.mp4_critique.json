    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, high-angle perspective, the camera focuses on a woman on the floor with a shallow depth of field. The camera is slightly unsteady as it tilts up, tracking the woman as she stands up. This movement causes the camera angle to shift to a level view and the woman to appear larger in the frame. Focus tracking keeps the woman sharp throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground. The camera uses focus tracking to keep the subject in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts up to follow the subject as they stand up.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tilting upward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the initial high angle and the shift to a level view, it misses several key nuances of the camera work. The phrasing \"eye-level, high-angle\" is slightly contradictory; it would be more precise to state that the camera is positioned at eye-level height, initially creating a high angle on the subject on the floor. The description of the movement as a \"tilt\" that is \"tracking\" is also imprecise. While the camera does tilt upward to follow her, the term \"tracking\" typically implies lateral movement. Based on the visual, the camera also performs a slow, subtle dolly-in as she rises, which is the primary reason she appears larger in the frame, not just the tilt alone. This forward motion, combined with the upward tilt, creates a more intimate and engaging shot. A crucial missing detail is the video speed; the entire sequence is in subtle slow-motion, which emphasizes the grace of the woman's movement as she stands. Furthermore, while \"slightly unsteady\" is accurate, it could be more descriptive, such as \"a gentle, organic sway characteristic of a handheld shot.\" The \"shallow depth of field\" could also be elaborated on; for instance, the background is rendered as soft, creamy bokeh from what appear to be city lights outside a window, which contributes significantly to the shot's intimate, contemplative mood.",
