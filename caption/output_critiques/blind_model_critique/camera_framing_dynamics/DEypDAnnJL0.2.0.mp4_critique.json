    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, high-angle perspective, the camera focuses on a woman on the floor with a shallow depth of field. The camera is slightly unsteady as it tilts up, tracking the woman as she stands up. This movement causes the camera angle to shift to a level view and the woman to appear larger in the frame. Focus tracking keeps the woman sharp throughout the shot.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground. The camera uses focus tracking to keep the subject in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts up to follow the subject as they stand up.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tilting upward to track the subject. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is a highly accurate, complete, and well-structured description that perfectly follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of \"eye-level, high-angle perspective\" is precise. The camera is positioned at the eye level of a standing person, but because the subject is on the floor, the initial angle is high. The caption correctly notes that this angle shifts to a \"level view\" as the woman stands up.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption accurately identifies the \"shallow depth of field\" (blurry background) and the use of \"focus tracking\" to keep the moving subject sharp.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement as a \"slightly unsteady\" \"tilt up\" that is \"tracking the woman\" is perfect. It correctly identifies the type of rotation (tilt), its purpose (tracking), and its quality (unsteady).\n*   **Framing Effect:** The observation that the movement causes the \"woman to appear larger in the frame\" is an accurate and insightful detail about the consequence of the action.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant details mandated by the instructions while correctly omitting the unnecessary ones.\n*   **Included:** It covers camera height, camera angle (and its change), camera movement (type, steadiness, purpose), and focus (depth and dynamic changes).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:** As per the instructions, it does not mention video speed (which is regular), lens distortion (which is absent), or Dutch angle (which is not used). This demonstrates a good understanding of the conciseness rule.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption excels at following the specific formatting and terminology guidelines.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The description is compact and avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice, yet it is packed with all the necessary technical information.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specified vocabulary correctly (e.g., `high-angle`, `level view`, `shallow depth of field`, `tilts up`, `tracking`, `focus tracking`).\n*   **Logical Structure:** The caption describes the shot's configuration in a clear, temporal order: it starts with the initial setup, describes the movement, and then explains the results of that movement.\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Refinement (Optional):\nThe caption is already excellent, but for the sake of absolute perfection, the opening phrase could be slightly reworded for flow.\n\n*   **Original:** \"From an eye-level, high-angle perspective...\"\n*   **Alternative:** \"The shot begins from an eye-level, high-angle view...\" or \"From an eye-level height, the camera starts at a high angle...\"\n\nThis is a very minor stylistic point. The original phrasing is still clear and accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and uses the correct terminology efficiently, resulting in a description that is both technically precise and easy to understand.",
