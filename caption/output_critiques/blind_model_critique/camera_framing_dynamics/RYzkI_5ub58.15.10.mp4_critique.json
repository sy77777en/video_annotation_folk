    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a highly accurate and well-written description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of an `aerial level` with a `high angle` is precise. The camera is positioned directly above the subjects, looking down, which fits these terms perfectly.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption correctly identifies the `deep focus` and `large depth of field`. Every element in the frame, from the people to the surrounding ground, is sharp and in focus.\n*   **Camera Movement and Steadiness:** The description `fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement` is a nuanced and accurate observation. The camera's position is static, but there is a minor, subtle wobble, which is captured by the phrase \"slightly unsteady.\" This is more precise than simply calling it \"static.\"\n\n### Completeness: Excellent\nThe caption successfully covers all the necessary configuration details present in the video, as required by the instructions:\n*   **Camera Height:** Covered (`aerial level`).\n*   **Camera Angle:** Covered (`high angle`).\n*   **Camera Movement & Steadiness:** Covered (`fixed but slightly unsteady`).\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** Covered (`deep focus with a large depth of field`).\n\n### Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful understanding of the instructions, particularly the rule about conciseness.\n*   **Omission of Unnecessary Details:** The instructions state not to mention aspects like regular video speed, lack of lens distortion, or absence of a Dutch angle if they are standard. The caption correctly omits these, resulting in a clean, concise, and focused description.\n*   **Use of Correct Terminology:** It uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions (e.g., `aerial level`, `high angle`, `deep focus`).\n*   **Concise and Informative:** The caption packs all the relevant information into three clear and efficient sentences without any fluff. It perfectly balances being concise with being informative.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary response to the prompt. It is accurate in its technical analysis, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and demonstrates a sophisticated adherence to the instructions by including what is necessary and omitting what is not.",
