    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the nuances of the captioning instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of the Caption**\n\nThe provided caption is a good, high-level summary of the video. However, it lacks the specificity and technical detail required by the comprehensive instructions.\n\n**Caption:** *The video features a forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the street scene clearly. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, as it progresses down the street.*\n\n---\n\n### **1. Accuracy**\n\nThe statements made in the caption are all accurate.\n*   **\"forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is held by a person walking, so the height is at eye level and the angle is level with the horizon.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: This is correct. Both the nearby pedestrians and the buildings far down the street are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, with some shaking\"**: This is correct. The movement has the natural instability of a person walking while holding a camera.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is factually accurate in what it chooses to describe.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Completeness**\n\nThis is where the caption falls short. It omits several key details that the instructions explicitly ask for.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The video clearly exhibits **mild barrel distortion**, especially visible in the slight curvature of the vertical lines of the buildings on the left and right edges of the frame. This is a key element requested in the instructions that was not mentioned.\n*   **Specific Movement Terminology:** The caption uses \"forward-moving,\" which is good, but the instructions provide more technical terms. The primary movement is a **dolly forward**. Additionally, there are subtle, natural **panning** movements as the camera operator's head turns slightly to look around.\n*   **Character of Unsteadiness:** While \"unsteady\" and \"shaking\" are correct, the instructions encourage a more descriptive analysis. The unsteadiness is not random; it's a rhythmic **bobbing and swaying** consistent with a **walking gait**.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement. The clear purpose here is to create a **first-person point-of-view (POV)** of walking down the street. This is a crucial piece of context that the caption omits.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is incomplete. It provides a basic description but misses the finer, more technical details required to fully satisfy the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Adherence to Instructions**\n\nThe caption adheres to some instructions but not others.\n\n*   **Adhered:**\n    *   It correctly omits mentions of **video speed** and **Dutch angle**, as they are standard (normal speed, no tilt).\n    *   It is **concise**.\n    *   It correctly identifies **camera height, angle, focus, and general movement**.\n\n*   **Did Not Adhere:**\n    *   It failed to identify and describe the **lens distortion**.\n    *   It did not use the more specific terminology for movement (**dolly, pan**) or describe the movement's **purpose (POV)**.\n    *   It could have been more descriptive about the **nature of the camera's unsteadiness** (linking it to a walking gait).\n\n---\n\n### **Revised and Improved Caption**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more closely follows the instructions, incorporating the missing details for a more complete and technical description:\n\n**\"Shot from an eye-level height with a level angle, the video exhibits mild barrel distortion. A deep focus keeps the entire street scene sharp. The camera dollies forward at a walking pace to create a first-person point-of-view, with its movement characterized by the unsteady bobbing and swaying of a natural walking gait.\"**",
