    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and almost perfectly fulfills all the requirements of the instruction. It is concise, informative, and uses the correct technical terminology.\n\n### Evaluation Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The terms used—`aerial-level`, `high angle`, `deep focus`, and `arcs counterclockwise`—are precise and accurately describe a plausible camera and video configuration for the scene described. The description paints a very clear picture of the shot.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\nThe caption successfully covers the most critical aspects requested:\n*   **Camera Height:** Correctly identified as `aerial-level`.\n*   **Camera Angle:** Correctly identified as `high angle`.\n*   **Focus:** Correctly identified as `deep focus` with a good explanation (`maintaining clarity across the entire scene`).\n*   **Movement (Type, Steadiness, Purpose):** The movement is well-described as a `smoothly` executed `counterclockwise arc` with the purpose of `providing a comprehensive view`. The mention of `minimal shaking` adds a useful layer of detail about the shot's quality.\n\n**Minor Omission:**\n*   The only minor detail missing is the **speed** of the movement (e.g., \"slowly,\" \"at a moderate pace\"). While \"smoothly\" often implies a controlled, slower speed, explicitly stating it would make the description even more complete.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is exceptionally concise. It packs a significant amount of technical information into just two clear sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Omission of Unnecessary Details:** It correctly follows the instruction to omit details for normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and the absence of a Dutch angle. This is a key part of the instructions that was followed perfectly.\n*   **Single Shot Assumption:** The caption describes the video as a single, continuous shot. This is an appropriate and concise way to handle a video that doesn't have cuts or transitions.\n\n### Final Verdict:\n\nThis is a high-quality caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is a model example of how to apply the given rules.\n\nTo make it absolutely perfect, you could add the speed of the movement:\n\n**Slightly Improved Version:**\n\"The video features an aerial-level camera at a high angle, looking down on an airplane crash scene. The camera employs deep focus, maintaining clarity across the entire scene. It **slowly and smoothly** arcs counterclockwise around the airplane, providing a comprehensive view of the crash site with minimal shaking.\"",
