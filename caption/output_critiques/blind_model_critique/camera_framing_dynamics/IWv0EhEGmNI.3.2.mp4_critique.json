    "pre_caption": "From a first-person perspective, the camera begins at a hip-level, high-angle view, focusing on a pair of hands securing a rope. This initial shot is characterized by intense, unsteady shaking and a varying Dutch angle. The camera then tilts upward, transitioning to an eye-level, level-angle view that looks out over a dark, foggy town, with the shaking becoming milder. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping both the immediate foreground and the distant background sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, representing the FPV perspective in a game, remains stationary with intense shaking at first, then tilts up with a milder shake.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is very good and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions, but it has one significant inaccuracy regarding focus.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **Correct:**\n    *   **Perspective:** \"First-person perspective\" is spot on.\n    *   **Initial Angle & Subject:** \"high-angle view, focusing on a pair of hands securing a rope\" is an accurate description of the initial framing.\n    *   **Movement & Steadiness:** \"intense, unsteady shaking,\" \"varying Dutch angle,\" \"camera then tilts upward,\" and \"shaking becoming milder\" are all precise and correct observations.\n    *   **Final Framing:** \"eye-level, level-angle view that looks out over a dark, foggy town\" perfectly describes the second part of the shot.\n\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"hip-level\" is a plausible but likely incorrect interpretation. For a first-person view where someone is looking down at their own hands, the camera is almost certainly at **eye-level**, but it is **tilted down** to create the high-angle shot. A hip-level camera would likely show the hands more directly in front of the lens, not below it.\n\n*   **Major Inaccuracy:**\n    *   **Focus:** The statement \"A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping both the immediate foreground and the distant background sharp\" is **incorrect**. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**.\n        *   In the beginning, the hands and rope in the foreground are in focus, while the distant town is visibly blurred.\n        *   After the camera tilts up, the focus shifts to the distant town, which becomes sharp, while the foreground railing is now slightly out of focus. This is a form of **focus change** that follows the subject of interest.\n\n**Completeness: Excellent**\n\n*   The caption successfully addresses all the key elements requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** Perspective (FPV), angle, height, movements (tilt, shaking), steadiness, and Dutch angle are all covered.\n    *   **Focus:** It attempts to describe the depth of field, although inaccurately.\n    *   **Video Speed & Lens Distortion:** It correctly omits these as they are standard/not present, following the conciseness rule.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is compact and avoids unnecessary words while being highly informative.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms (high-angle, level-angle, Dutch angle, tilts).\n*   **Structure:** It describes the camera's actions sequentially (\"begins at...\", \"then tilts upward...\"), which makes the action easy to follow.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and descriptive.\n\n### Summary and Revised Caption\n\nThe caption is well-written and follows the instructions almost perfectly. Its only significant flaw is the misidentification of the depth of field. Correcting this and the minor point about camera height would make it flawless.\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the inaccuracies:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\nFrom a first-person perspective, the camera starts at eye-level with a high-angle downward view, characterized by intense, unsteady shaking and a varying Dutch angle. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the foreground hands securing a rope while the distant town is blurred. The camera then tilts upward to an eye-level, level-angle view, with the shaking becoming milder as the focus shifts to the sharp, distant foggy town.",
