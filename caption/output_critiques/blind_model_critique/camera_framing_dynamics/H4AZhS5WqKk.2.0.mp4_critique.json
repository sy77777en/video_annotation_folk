    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**.\n\nIt is inaccurate and incomplete, failing to capture the most significant dynamic element of the shot.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is only partially accurate.\n\n*   **\"The camera is static...\" - INCORRECT:** This is the most significant error. The camera is not static; it is in motion. It performs a slow, smooth **trucking** movement from left to right. This movement is a key storytelling element of the shot, and misidentifying it as static fundamentally misrepresents the video.\n*   **\"...at a low angle...\" - CORRECT:** The camera is positioned below the subject's eye line and is angled upward, which is a correct description of a low angle.\n*   **\"...using a shallow depth of field...\" - CORRECT:** The subject (Tom) is in sharp focus, while the background is clearly and intentionally blurred, which is characteristic of a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"...focused on Tom in the foreground.\" - CORRECT:** The plane of focus is correctly identified as the foreground, where the character Tom is located.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and misses several key details required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** By incorrectly stating the camera is static, the caption fails to describe the movement's **type (trucking), direction (right), speed (slow), and steadiness (steady/smooth)**.\n*   **Camera Height:** The caption mentions the \"low angle\" but omits the **camera height**. A more complete description would specify it as **low-level** or **hip-level**, as it is positioned well below the subject's head but not on the ground.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement if relevant. The slow truck right serves to gradually reveal the space and build a sense of quiet observation or tension, which is a detail a complete caption could include.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the core requirements of the instructions.\n\n*   The instructions place a heavy emphasis on describing camera movement in detail (\"translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing...\"). The caption's primary error is its failure to identify and describe the obvious camera movement, thus ignoring a major part of the prompt.\n*   It omits the camera height, another specific element requested in the instructions.\n*   While it correctly follows the instruction to be concise and to omit non-existent features (like lens distortion or speed changes), it does so at the expense of accuracy and completeness regarding the shot's most important characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"From a low angle and height, the camera trucks slowly and steadily to the right. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the focus locked on Tom in the foreground while the background remains out of focus.\"**",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a low angle and hip-level height, the camera trucks slowly and steadily to the right, maintaining a shallow depth of field.
