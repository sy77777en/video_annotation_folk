    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a worm's-eye view angle (looking directly up).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a very good and accurate description of the video, adhering closely to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **\"This worm's-eye view shot...\"**: **Correct.** The camera is positioned at a very low angle, looking almost straight up, which is the definition of a worm's-eye view.\n*   **\"...looks directly up at the night sky between tall buildings.\"**: **Correct.** This accurately describes the setting and composition of the shot.\n*   **\"The camera uses a deep focus, rendering the buildings and the figure on the wire in sharp detail.\"**: **Correct.** All elements in the frame, from the foreground building walls to the distant figure and sky, are in sharp focus. This is a perfect example of deep focus.\n*   **\"The camera executes a smooth, minor upward movement.\"**: **Correct.** There is a very slow, steady, and subtle upward tilt. The description of the movement as \"smooth,\" \"minor,\" and \"upward\" is precise.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is exceptionally complete while remaining concise, as instructed.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** It correctly identifies the `worm's-eye view`, which also implies a very low camera height (ground-level).\n*   **Focus:** It accurately describes the `deep focus` and what elements are in focus.\n*   **Movement:** It correctly identifies the presence, quality, and direction of the camera movement.\n*   **Omissions:** Crucially, it follows the instruction to be concise by correctly omitting details that are not present or are standard. There is no mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's normal, so it's not mentioned.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is none, so it's not mentioned.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so it's not mentioned.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single shot, so no transitions are described.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction:\nThe caption perfectly follows the instructions. It provides a concise, informative description of the camera's configuration and movement using the specified terminology. It avoids subjective descriptions of the video's content (e.g., \"a daring tightrope walker\") and focuses purely on the technical aspects of the shot, as requested.\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Improvement:\nTo be even more technically precise, \"upward movement\" could be specified as an **\"upward tilt.\"** However, \"upward movement\" is still perfectly clear and accurate in this context, so this is a very minor point. The current wording is excellent for general understanding.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is excellent. It is accurate, complete, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by including all relevant details while omitting unnecessary ones.",
