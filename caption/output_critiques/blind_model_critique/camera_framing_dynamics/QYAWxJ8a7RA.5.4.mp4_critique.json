    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good starting point and correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot. However, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's movement and focus, and it omits important details required by the instructions, such as the movement's steadiness and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains misleading descriptions.\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"camera is positioned at eye level\"**: Correct. The perspective strongly suggests a person of average height holding the camera.\n    *   **\"maintains a level angle\"**: Correct. The horizon is not intentionally tilted.\n    *   **\"deep focus and a large depth of field\"**: Correct. The foreground sign, midground trees, and background building are all relatively sharp.\n    *   **\"slowly forward\"**: Correct. The primary movement is a slow advance.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"moves smoothly\"**: This is the most significant error. The camera has a clear, consistent **handheld shake** or wobble, characteristic of someone walking. A \"smooth\" movement would imply the use of a gimbal, dolly, or stabilizer, which is not the case here.\n    *   **\"and upward\"**: This is misleading. While there is natural vertical bobbing from the walking motion, there is no distinct, deliberate \"upward\" movement like a pedestal or crane. The primary directional movement is forward.\n    *   **\"focusing on the warning sign in the foreground\"**: This is an inaccurate description of the focus. While the sign is in focus, the statement implies a shallow depth of field where only the foreground is sharp. The caption correctly identifies the \"deep focus\" earlier, but this final clause contradicts it by singling out one element. The focus is maintained across the entire scene, not just on the sign.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete and misses key descriptive elements required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Steadiness:** The instructions explicitly ask to describe shaking or wobbling. The caption fails to mention the noticeable handheld shake, instead describing the movement inaccurately as \"smooth.\"\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The movement clearly establishes a **first-person point of view (POV)**, making the viewer feel like they are the one walking through the scene. This is a crucial piece of context that the caption omits.\n*   **Movement Type:** While \"moves forward\" is acceptable, using a more technical term like **\"dolly forward\"** or **\"tracking forward\"** would be more precise, as per the instructions' examples.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some instructions but fails on several key points.\n\n*   **Followed:**\n    *   It is concise.\n    *   It correctly omits non-existent features (video speed alteration, lens distortion, Dutch angle).\n    *   It addresses camera height, angle, and focus.\n\n*   **Not Followed:**\n    *   It fails to accurately describe **steadiness**, a specific requirement (\"If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree\").\n    *   It misrepresents the **focus plane** by implying the focus is only on the foreground, when the instructions ask for a clear description of what is in focus (foreground, midground, background).\n    *   It does not fully describe the **movement's character and purpose** (handheld POV), which is a key part of understanding the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**From an eye-level, level-angle perspective, the camera moves slowly forward with a slight handheld shake, simulating a first-person point of view. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the foreground warning sign, midground trees, and background building all sharply in view.**",
