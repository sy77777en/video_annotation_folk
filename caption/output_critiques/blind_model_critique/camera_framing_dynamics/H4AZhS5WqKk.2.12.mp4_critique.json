    "pre_caption": "**Description of Video’s and Camera’s Configuration:**\n\nThe camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows an animated character in a real-world background. The animated character remains sharp throughout, while the real-world background is out of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is a perfect example of how to apply the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Perfect**\n*   **Camera Position:** The description of the camera at **eye level** with a **level angle** is spot on. The perspective is neutral and straight-on.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The shot is correctly identified as **completely static**. There is no panning, tilting, zooming, or shaking.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The analysis of the focus is precise. It correctly identifies the **shallow depth of field**, noting that the animated character (Tom) is the sharp **foreground** element while the real-world background is **out of focus**. This is the most prominent visual characteristic of the video, and the caption describes it perfectly.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the *relevant* aspects mentioned in the instructions: camera height, angle, movement, and focus.\n*   Crucially, it follows the instruction to remain concise by omitting details that are not present. It does not waste words stating \"the video is at regular speed,\" \"there is no lens distortion,\" or \"there is no Dutch angle,\" which demonstrates a high-level understanding of the prompt.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and highly informative. In just three sentences, it provides a complete and detailed technical summary of the shot.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"static,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"foreground,\" and \"out of focus.\"\n*   **Clarity:** The description is easy to understand. It clearly separates the different components of the camera's configuration (position, movement, focus) into logical statements.\n*   **Structure:** Since the video is a single, static shot, the caption correctly describes the camera's state without needing to detail a sequence of movements or transitions.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to apply the given instructions effectively. It is accurate in its description, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and demonstrates perfect adherence to the rules of conciseness and proper terminology. No improvements are needed.",
