    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, capturing a level angle. It then transitions to a low angle as it pans right and tilts up to focus on a man lying on rubble. The camera moves to eye level, ending at a high angle as it follows the man being pulled up. The focus is shallow, concentrating on the man in the foreground. The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, reflecting a first-person perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a ground level and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle starts at a level angle, transitions to a low angle, and ends at a high angle.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, representing a first-person POV, reveals the scene by first panning right and tilting up to face the partner. It then moves with the character as they are pulled up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** but not perfect. It successfully captures the main actions and general feel of the video. However, it misses some key technical details and uses slightly imprecise terminology, preventing it from being a complete and fully accurate description according to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The description of the camera starting at `ground level` with a `level angle`, transitioning to a `low angle`, moving to `eye level`, and ending at a `high angle` is accurate and well-observed.\n    *   **Basic Movements:** Identifying the initial `pan right` and `tilt up` is correct.\n    *   **Focus:** Stating the focus is `shallow` is correct.\n    *   **Steadiness & Perspective:** Correctly identifying the movement as `unsteady with noticeable shaking` and attributing it to a `first-person perspective` is a key insight and perfectly accurate.\n\n*   **What could be more accurate:**\n    *   **Focus Plane:** The caption states the focus is on the man in the **foreground**. This is slightly inaccurate. The rescuer's hands are in the true foreground. The man being rescued is in the **midground**. The distinction is important for technical precision.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What the caption is missing:**\n    *   **Specific Movement Types:** The caption says the camera \"moves to eye level.\" While true, it doesn't use the specific terminology requested in the instructions. This vertical movement is a **pedestal up**. There is also a slight forward movement, a **dolly in**, as the rescuer reaches for and pulls the man. The caption omits these more precise terms.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** While it mentions the first-person perspective, it could more explicitly state that the camera movement's purpose is to **simulate the physical action of a person standing up while pulling another person**.\n    *   **Shot Continuity:** The instructions mention describing shot transitions. While there are no transitions here, it would be more complete to state that this is a **single, continuous shot**.\n\n*   **What the caption correctly omits (Adherence to Conciseness):**\n    *   The caption correctly avoids mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, as none are present. This follows the instruction to be concise.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption attempts to cover most of the required categories: height, angle, movement, steadiness, and focus.\n    *   It is relatively concise.\n    *   It correctly identifies the purpose of the camera's unsteadiness (POV).\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   The primary weakness is the failure to use the specific vocabulary for camera movements like **pedestal** and **dolly**, which were explicitly listed in the instructions. It uses the more generic \"moves to\" instead.\n    *   The description of the focus plane (\"foreground\") is not as precise as it could be (\"midground\").\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\n**\"This single, continuous shot is filmed from a first-person perspective. The camera begins at ground-level with a level angle, then pans right and tilts up to a low angle, focusing on a man in the midground. It then dollies forward slightly and pedestals up to eye-level as the rescuer pulls the man up, ending in a high angle. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the man in focus. The entire movement is unsteady with moderate shaking, simulating the rescuer's physical effort.\"**",
