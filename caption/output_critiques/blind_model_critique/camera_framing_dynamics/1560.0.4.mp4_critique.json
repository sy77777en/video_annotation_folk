    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** \"The video is static with no camera movement or lens distortion.\"\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe provided caption is **inaccurate and incomplete**. While it correctly identifies that the camera is static and lacks distortion, it fails to include several other key descriptive elements required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is partially accurate. The camera is indeed **static**, and there is **no discernible lens distortion**. However, stating \"static with no camera movement\" is redundant, as a static camera by definition does not move. Furthermore, the instructions specify not to mention the absence of lens distortion, making its inclusion a minor violation of the conciseness rule.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is highly incomplete. It omits the following required details:\n    *   **Camera Angle:** It fails to mention that this is a **high-angle** shot, verging on a **bird's-eye view**.\n    *   **Camera Height:** It does not describe the **overhead-level** camera placement.\n    *   **Focus:** It completely misses the description of the **shallow depth of field**, which keeps the hands and rope in focus while blurring the background. It also fails to specify that the **focus plane is on the midground**.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption fails to adhere to the core instruction of providing a \"concise yet **informative** description\" of the camera's full configuration. It correctly follows the rule for describing a static shot but neglects to include the mandatory descriptions of angle, height, and focus, which are clearly visible in the video.\n\n### Corrected Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n\"This is a static, overhead-level, high-angle shot. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus fixed on the hands and rope in the midground.\"",
