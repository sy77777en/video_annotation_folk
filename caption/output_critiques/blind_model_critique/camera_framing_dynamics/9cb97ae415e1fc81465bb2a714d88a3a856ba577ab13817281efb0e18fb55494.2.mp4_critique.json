    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot. However, it has one significant inaccuracy and could be more complete according to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Feedback on Your Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera pans right, focusing on the park scene, with slight unsteadiness and some shaking.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **Accuracy: Good, with one key error.**\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"eye level\" and \"level angle\" are both correct. The perspective is that of a person standing and looking forward.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is an excellent description. Both the person in the foreground and the trees/buildings in the background are in focus.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"slight unsteadiness and some shaking\" is accurate. The movement is not perfectly smooth and has the natural bob of a handheld or walking shot.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Movement:** The description \"pans right\" is incomplete and therefore misleading. A **pan** is a rotational movement where the camera turns on a fixed axis (like turning your head while standing still). In the video, the camera is also physically moving from left to right through space. This is called a **trucking** or **tracking** shot. The camera is doing both simultaneously: it is **trucking right** while also **panning right**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Completeness: Mostly complete, but misses a key movement type.**\n\n*   The caption correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n*   It successfully covers height, angle, focus, and steadiness.\n*   The primary omission is the failure to describe the **translational movement** (trucking) as specified in the instructions, which ask to distinguish between rotation (pan) and translation (trucking, dollying).\n\n---\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions: Good, but could be better.**\n\n*   The caption is concise and informative, as requested.\n*   It uses some of the specified terminology correctly (e.g., \"eye level,\" \"deep focus\").\n*   However, by misidentifying the full scope of the movement, it doesn't fully meet the instruction to describe movements like \"tracking\" or \"trucking\" when they occur.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from an eye-level, level angle, the camera trucks right while simultaneously panning right to follow the park scene. The movement has a slight, natural unsteadiness characteristic of a handheld walking motion. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping all elements from the foreground to the background sharp.\"**",
