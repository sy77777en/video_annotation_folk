    "pre_caption": "This level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a USB drive in the foreground. The camera smoothly moves forward and down, following the drive as it is inserted into a port.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and moving down.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the caption based on the provided instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** but not perfect. It is concise and accurately captures the main visual elements of the shot. However, it lacks some of the specific technical terminology and detail required by the instructions, particularly concerning camera movement and dynamic focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the likely visual events.\n*   **\"level-angle shot\"**: This is an accurate description for a camera positioned on the same horizontal plane as the action (inserting a USB drive).\n*   **\"shallow depth of field to focus on a USB drive in the foreground\"**: This correctly identifies the focus technique used to isolate the subject (the USB drive) and blur the background, which is a common practice for this type of close-up shot.\n*   **\"smoothly moves forward and down, following the drive\"**: This accurately describes the general path and quality of the camera's motion.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing a few key details mandated by the instructions.\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description is too general. The instructions ask for specific movement types like *dollying*, *pedestaling*, and *tracking*.\n    *   \"moves forward\" should be described as **dollying forward**.\n    *   \"moves down\" should be described as **pedestaling down**.\n    *   \"following the drive\" should be described as **tracking the drive**.\n*   **Focus:** The caption correctly identifies the shallow depth of field but misses a crucial dynamic element. As the camera moves forward, the distance to the subject changes. To keep the USB drive sharp, the focus must be actively adjusted. The instructions ask to note this as **focus tracking**. The current caption implies the focus is static, which is incorrect for a shot with this type of movement.\n*   **Camera Height:** While \"level-angle\" is included, a more descriptive term like **\"desk-level\"** or **\"low-level\"** would provide more context, although this is a minor omission.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to some instructions but falls short on others.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** **Excellent.** The caption is brief and to the point.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** **Excellent.** It correctly avoids mentioning regular video speed, the absence of lens distortion, or a level horizon (no Dutch angle), as per the instructions.\n*   **Use of Technical Terms:** **Needs Improvement.** It fails to use the specific technical terms for movement (dolly, pedestal, tracking) and focus (focus tracking) that are explicitly listed in the instructions.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nTo fully meet the requirements of the instructions, the caption could be revised to be more technically specific without losing its conciseness.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> This level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on a USB drive in the foreground. The camera smoothly moves forward and down, following the drive as it is inserted into a port.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n> This level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus plane on the foreground. The camera smoothly **dollies forward** and **pedestals down** to **track** the USB drive as it's inserted into a port, utilizing **focus tracking** to keep the drive sharp throughout the movement.",
