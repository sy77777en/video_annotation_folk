    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is **accurate** but **incomplete**. While the information it provides is correct, it omits several key details required by the comprehensive instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\nThe statements in the caption are entirely correct.\n*   **\"This is a stop-motion animation...\"**: Correct. The objects move in discrete, frame-by-frame steps, which is the defining characteristic of stop-motion.\n*   **\"...with a static camera...\"**: Correct. The camera's overall position and framing do not change throughout the video. There is no panning, tilting, or dollying.\n*   **\"...that exhibits slight unsteadiness.\"**: Correct. There is a minor jitter or shift in the camera's position between frames, likely from the animator interacting with the scene or the camera being on a slightly unstable surface. This observation is precise and valuable.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Lacking\nThe caption fails to include several required descriptive elements from the instructions.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption omits this. The video is filmed from a **high angle**, looking down at the table. The height is approximately **eye-level** relative to a standing person, positioned above the tabletop scene.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** This is a significant omission. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**. The objects on the table (the midground) are in sharp focus, while the floor in the background is noticeably blurred. The focus remains fixed on the midground throughout.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The caption correctly omits this, as there is no discernible distortion.\n*   **Video Speed:** While it correctly identifies the technique as \"stop-motion,\" it could be slightly more descriptive, but what's there is sufficient.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction: Partial\nThe caption adheres to the rule of being concise and omitting unnecessary information (like \"no lens distortion\"). However, it fails to adhere to the core instruction of providing a **complete description** covering all the specified attributes. It prioritizes conciseness over being fully informative as per the guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that incorporates the missing details while remaining concise, fully adhering to your instructions:\n\n**\"This stop-motion animation is filmed from a static, high angle, exhibiting slight unsteadiness between frames. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground action in focus while the background remains blurred.\"**",
