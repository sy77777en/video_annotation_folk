    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on a very narrow plane. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the camera angle. It successfully adheres to the instructions for conciseness by focusing only on the most relevant and observable camera and video properties.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"Static\"**: This is accurate. The camera does not pan, tilt, zoom, or move in any way throughout the video.\n    *   **\"Extremely shallow depth of field\"**: This is an excellent and accurate description. The subject (the cat) is in sharp focus, while the background is heavily blurred, effectively isolating the subject.\n    *   **\"Keeps the focus on... the foreground\"**: This is correct. The plane of focus is fixed on the cat, which occupies the foreground of the shot.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"Level-angle shot\"**: This is inaccurate. The camera is positioned very low to the ground and is tilted slightly upward to frame the cat's face. This is a **low-angle** shot, not a level-angle one. A level-angle shot would be parallel to the ground and aimed straight ahead, which is not the case here.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is very complete in describing the most prominent visual characteristics of the shot.\n*   It correctly identifies the static nature of the camera, the depth of field, and the focus plane.\n*   It could be slightly more complete by specifying the **camera height**. Given its position, **\"ground-level\"** would be a perfect addition to complement the \"low-angle\" description.\n*   As per the instructions, it correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., video speed alteration, lens distortion, Dutch angle, camera movement), which demonstrates good adherence to the conciseness rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise and effective, combining multiple key descriptors into a single, easy-to-read sentence.\n*   **Informative Description:** It successfully provides an informative description of the camera's configuration and focus, fulfilling the core requirement of the instructions.\n*   **Omission of Redundant Info:** It correctly avoids mentioning that the video is at regular speed or has no lens distortion, which aligns with the instruction to only describe present or altered features.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion and Improved Caption\n\nThe caption is well-written and mostly accurate, but the error in describing the camera angle is a notable flaw. By correcting this and adding the camera height, the caption becomes fully accurate and even more descriptive.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> This is a static, level-angle shot with an extremely shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on Tom, the red devil cat in the foreground.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n> This is a static, **low-angle** shot from **ground-level**, featuring an extremely shallow depth of field that keeps the focus on the cat in the foreground.",
