    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, capturing a high angle view of grass in the foreground. It uses a shallow depth of field, initially focusing on the grass. The camera then moves forward and tilts up, transitioning to a level angle as it shifts focus to the midground, where a person’s legs are visible. This focus change is achieved through a rack focus. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the foreground, and later becomes focused on the midground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good and captures most of the key technical aspects of the video correctly. It follows a logical sequence and uses some appropriate terminology. However, it contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the camera angle and could be more precise in its description of the camera movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the **camera height** (`ground level`), the **depth of field** (`shallow depth of field`), the initial **focus plane** (foreground grass), the **camera movement** (`moves forward and tilts up`), the **focus change** (`shifts focus to the midground`), the new subject (`a person’s legs`), the type of focus change (`rack focus`), and the **camera steadiness** (`unsteady, with noticeable shaking`).\n\n*   **Inaccurate:** The most significant error is describing the initial view as a **`high angle`**.\n    *   **Correction:** A high angle shot looks *down* on a subject. In the video, the camera is at ground level looking *up* at the blades of grass. This is a **`low angle`** shot. It transitions to a more `level angle` relative to the horizon as it tilts up.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is quite comprehensive but misses a few details mentioned in the instructions that would add more precision.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Movement Terminology:** The instruction provides specific terms like `dollying` (moving the entire camera forward/backward). The caption uses the more generic \"moves forward.\" Using **`dollies forward`** would be more technically precise.\n    *   **Movement Speed:** The instructions ask for the speed of movement. The camera moves at a steady, moderate pace, consistent with walking. This detail is omitted.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** The instructions suggest describing the purpose of the movement if relevant. Here, the movement and focus shift serve to reveal the environment and the subject (the walker), simulating a first-person point of view.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the overall goal of being concise yet informative.\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The description is brief and to the point.\n    *   **Correct Omissions:** It correctly avoids mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, as they are not present, following the instruction to only include relevant details.\n    *   **Structure:** It describes the action chronologically, starting with the initial setup and then detailing the movement and focus changes, which is logical and easy to follow.\n    *   **Terminology:** It successfully uses technical terms like `shallow depth of field` and `rack focus`.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   As noted in the Completeness section, incorporating more of the specific terminology from the instructions (e.g., `low angle`, `dollying`) would demonstrate a fuller adherence to the prompt.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised version of the caption that incorporates the feedback and aligns more closely with the instructions:\n\n**\"The video is captured from an unsteady, ground-level camera with a shallow depth of field. The shot begins at a low angle, focused on the foreground grass. The camera then dollies forward at a walking pace while tilting up, transitioning to a level angle. Simultaneously, it performs a rack focus to shift the focus plane to the midground, bringing the walker's legs into sharp view.\"**",
