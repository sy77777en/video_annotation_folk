    "pre_caption": "Shot from a level angle, the camera moves forward quickly and smoothly in the first second to frame an apartment window and a mouse on the ledge. As the camera moves, the focus shifts from deep to a shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground sharp while blurring the background. The camera then remains static for the rest of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** At the beginning of the video, a deep focus is used, keeping everything in the frame sharp and clear. As the camera rapidly zooms forward and stops at the window, the depth of field becomes shallower, shifting focus to the foreground while the background blurs.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera quickly moves forward in the first second to frame an apartment window and a mouse on the window ledge. It then remains static for the rest of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption is partially good but has significant inaccuracies and omissions when judged against the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:** The caption correctly identifies that the camera moves \"forward quickly and smoothly,\" that the focus \"shifts from deep to a shallow depth of field,\" and that the camera \"remains static for the rest of the video.\" The description of the focus change is particularly well-done and accurate.\n*   **What it gets wrong:** The caption states the shot is \"from a level angle,\" which is inaccurate. The camera **starts** at a low angle looking up at the building and **ends** at a level angle, looking directly at the window. The change in angle is a key part of the shot that is misrepresented.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is not complete according to the instructions. It is missing several key details:\n\n*   **Camera Movement:** It only describes the forward movement (\"moves forward\"). It completely omits the simultaneous **upward movement** (a \"pedestal up\" or \"crane up\") that is necessary to travel from street level to the window's height.\n*   **Camera Height:** The instructions require a description of camera height (e.g., ground-level, eye-level) and any changes. The caption fails to mention that the camera starts at a low height and moves to a much higher one.\n*   **Camera Angle:** As mentioned in the accuracy section, it fails to describe the starting low angle and the transition to a level angle.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption succeeds in being concise and correctly omits unnecessary information (like normal video speed and lack of distortion).\n*   However, it fails to provide a complete and informative description of the camera's configuration and movement as required. By omitting the vertical movement and the change in height/angle, it provides a misleading picture of the shot's dynamics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a decent, simple summary for a casual viewer, but it does not meet the technical requirements of the provided instructions. It misses crucial elements of camera movement and positioning, making it an incomplete and partially inaccurate technical description.\n\n---\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption:\n\nHere is an example of a caption that better follows the instructions:\n\n\"Starting from a **low angle** near **ground-level**, the camera executes a fast, smooth **dolly-in and pedestal-up**. During this movement, the focus shifts from **deep** to a **shallow depth of field**, isolating a mouse on a window ledge. The shot concludes at a **level angle**, remaining static with the foreground in sharp focus.\"",
