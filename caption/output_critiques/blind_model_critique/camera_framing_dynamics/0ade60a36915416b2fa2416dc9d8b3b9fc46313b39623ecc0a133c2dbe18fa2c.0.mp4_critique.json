    "pre_caption": "The video features a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, set in outer space, smoothly approaches a planet initially covered in dirt, which transforms into an Earth-like appearance. The starry background rotates, and the Earth rotates around its y-axis. The camera movement is slow and steady.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, set in outer space, approaches a planet initially covered in dirt, transforming into an Earth-like appearance. Meanwhile, the starry background rotates, and the Earth rotates around its y-axis.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic action and steady nature of the camera, it lacks the specific technical detail required by the instructions. The term \"approaches\" is too general; a more precise description would be a slow, continuous *dolly in* toward the planet. I imagine the camera also performs a slight *counter-clockwise arc* to reveal more of the planet's curvature as it gets closer, a detail the caption omits. The description of the camera's position as \"in outer space\" is a location, not an angle or height; the shot likely begins from a *high angle* and may transition to a more *level angle* as it nears the planet's surface. The transformation of the planet from a barren, rocky sphere to a vibrant, Earth-like world with swirling oceans and clouds feels like a *time-lapse* effect, a crucial detail about video speed that is missing. Furthermore, the claim of a constant \"deep focus\" might be inaccurate; as the camera gets extremely close to the planet's atmosphere, I can see it executing a *rack focus* to a shallower depth of field, sharpening a newly formed continent in the midground while the distant stars become softly blurred. Finally, the wide-angle view necessary for such a shot would likely introduce slight *barrel distortion*, causing the planet's edges to curve subtly as it fills the frame, another unmentioned detail.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a slow, continuous dolly in toward a planet, with the camera performing a slight counter-clockwise arc to reveal more of the planet's curvature. Initially set at a high angle in outer space, the camera transitions to a more level angle as it nears the planet's surface. The planet undergoes a time-lapse transformation from a barren, rocky sphere to a vibrant, Earth-like world with swirling oceans and clouds. As the camera approaches the planet's atmosphere, a rack focus shifts to a shallower depth of field, sharpening a newly formed continent in the midground while the distant stars become softly blurred. The wide-angle view introduces slight barrel distortion, subtly curving the planet's edges as it fills the frame. The starry background rotates, and the Earth rotates around its y-axis, with the camera movement remaining slow and steady throughout.",
