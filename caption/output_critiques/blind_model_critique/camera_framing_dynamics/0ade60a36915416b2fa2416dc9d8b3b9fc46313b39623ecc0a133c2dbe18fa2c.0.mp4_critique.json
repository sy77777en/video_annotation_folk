    "pre_caption": "The video features a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, set in outer space, smoothly approaches a planet initially covered in dirt, which transforms into an Earth-like appearance.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, set in outer space, approaches a planet initially covered in dirt, transforming into an Earth-like appearance. Meanwhile, the starry background rotates, and the Earth rotates around its y-axis.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is good, but it can be significantly improved by adhering more closely to the specific terminology and structure requested in the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is accurate in its general description of the video's content and mood. It correctly identifies the deep focus, the transformation of the planet, and the slow, steady nature of the movement. However, it lacks the technical specificity required by the instructions, particularly regarding camera movement and position.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the focus (`deep focus with a large depth of field`) is perfectly accurate. Both the planet and the background stars are sharp.\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the scene's events (planet transforming from dirt to Earth-like, rotation of the planet and background) is correct.\n*   **Accurate:** The description of the movement's qualities (`smoothly`, `slow and steady`) is correct.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption uses the general term \"approaches\" but fails to specify the technical type of camera movement. The instructions ask for terms like `dollying`. In this case, the camera is moving forward through space, which is a **dolly in**.\n*   **Incomplete:** The caption does not specify the **camera angle** or **height** using the terms from the instructions (e.g., `level angle`, `aerial-level`). While \"set in outer space\" implies the height, it's not the specific terminology requested.\n*   **Good:** The caption correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard/absent, which aligns with the instruction to be concise.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Partial Adherence:** The caption successfully identifies and describes the `focus` and `depth of field` as instructed.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** It fails to use the specific vocabulary for camera movement (`dolly in`) and camera angle (`level angle`). The instructions place a strong emphasis on using this precise terminology.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** The description of the camera movement is slightly fragmented. \"smoothly approaches\" is in one sentence, and \"movement is slow and steady\" is in another. These could be combined into a single, more concise statement.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"From a level angle in space, the camera performs a slow and steady dolly in towards a planet. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping both the planet and the distant starfield sharp. As the camera advances, the barren planet transforms into an Earth-like world, which rotates on its axis while the background also rotates.\"**\n\n### Why the Improved Caption is Better:\n\n*   **Specifies Angle:** It starts by defining the `level angle`.\n*   **Uses Technical Terms:** It correctly identifies the camera movement as a `dolly in`.\n*   **Combines Information:** It concisely describes the movement's type, speed, and steadiness in one phrase (\"slow and steady dolly in\").\n*   **Clear and Structured:** It describes the camera's configuration first, then the action within the scene, creating a logical flow that aligns perfectly with the instructions.",
