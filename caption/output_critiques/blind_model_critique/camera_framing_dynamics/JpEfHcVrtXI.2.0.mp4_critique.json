    "pre_caption": "This is a smooth, tail-tracking shot that follows a character from behind at eye level. As the character runs to the edge of a cliff and jumps, the camera cranes up, transitioning to a high, aerial angle. It continues to track the character as they fly forward. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping both the character and the fantastical landscape sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** A tail-tracking shot follows the character from above. As the character prepares to jump off the cliff, the camera cranes up and continues to track from a high angle as the character flies forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from above and behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions perfectly. It is accurate, complete, and adheres to all the specified guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in its description of the video's cinematography.\n\n*   **\"smooth, tail-tracking shot that follows a character from behind at eye level\"**: This is a perfect description of the initial action. The camera is steady (\"smooth\"), follows the subject (\"tracking\"), is positioned behind them (\"tail-tracking\"), and is at their height (\"eye level\").\n*   **\"the camera cranes up, transitioning to a high, aerial angle\"**: This correctly identifies the complex vertical movement as a \"crane up\" and accurately describes the resulting change in both angle (\"high, aerial\") and height.\n*   **\"It continues to track the character as they fly forward\"**: This confirms that the primary movement (tracking) is maintained throughout the shot, even after the crane movement.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping both the character and the fantastical landscape sharp\"**: This is a precise description of the depth of field. Both the foreground subject and the background environment are in sharp focus, which is the definition of \"deep focus.\"\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included Elements**:\n    *   **Camera Movement**: Thoroughly described with \"tail-tracking,\" \"cranes up,\" and its purpose (following the character).\n    *   **Steadiness**: Covered with the word \"smooth.\"\n    *   **Camera Angle**: Correctly identified as starting at \"eye level\" and transitioning to a \"high, aerial angle.\"\n    *   **Camera Height**: Implied and described through the \"eye level\" start and the \"crane up\" movement.\n    *   **Focus**: Clearly defined as \"deep focus.\"\n\n*   **Correctly Omitted Elements**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no visible distortion, so it is correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so this is not mentioned.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions flawlessly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: The description is packed with technical detail but remains easy to read and understand. It avoids unnecessary words while capturing the essence of the shot.\n*   **Correct Terminology**: It uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions, such as \"tracking,\" \"cranes up,\" \"eye level,\" \"high, aerial angle,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Logical Structure**: The description follows the action chronologically, first describing the initial setup and then detailing how the camera movement evolves as the character's action progresses. This makes the description clear and easy to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It serves as a perfect template for how to apply the detailed instructions to a video clip. It is precise, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and written in a clear, concise, and professional manner.",
