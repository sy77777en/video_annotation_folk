    "pre_caption": "This is a smooth, tail-tracking shot that follows a character from behind at eye level. As the character runs to the edge of a cliff and jumps, the camera cranes up, transitioning to a high, aerial angle. It continues to track the character as they fly forward. The entire scene is captured with a deep focus, keeping both the character and the fantastical landscape sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** A tail-tracking shot follows the character from above. As the character prepares to jump off the cliff, the camera cranes up and continues to track from a high angle as the character flies forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from above and behind.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the core action, it overlooks several key cinematic details that define the shot's impact. The description misses a crucial speed ramp; the video transitions into slow-motion just as the character leaps from the cliff, emphasizing the moment of weightlessness, before ramping back to normal speed as they begin to fly. The movement is more complex than described: the initial \"tail-tracking shot\" is a smooth dolly forward on a Steadicam or gimbal, and as the character jumps, the camera executes a combined crane-up and dolly-forward movement, pushing past the cliff edge with the character rather than just rising vertically. The caption's \"deep focus\" is an oversimplification; the shot appears to use a wide-angle lens, which introduces subtle barrel distortion on the cliff's vertical lines as the camera moves past. This creates a wide, but not infinite, depth of field—while the character and the midground floating islands are sharp, the most distant celestial bodies in the sky are slightly soft, enhancing the sense of immense scale. Finally, the initial camera height is closer to a heroic hip-level, looking slightly up at the character's back, which adds to their powerful presence before the camera cranes up to the high angle.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The scene begins with a dynamic dolly-forward shot on a Steadicam or gimbal, following the character from a heroic hip-level, slightly looking up to enhance their powerful presence. As the character runs towards the cliff's edge, the camera executes a complex movement, combining a crane-up and dolly-forward, seamlessly pushing past the cliff edge alongside the character. Just as they leap, the video transitions into slow-motion, capturing the moment of weightlessness before ramping back to normal speed as they begin to fly. The shot employs a wide-angle lens, introducing subtle barrel distortion on the cliff's vertical lines, which creates a wide depth of field. This keeps the character and midground floating islands sharp, while the most distant celestial bodies remain slightly soft, enhancing the sense of immense scale. The camera ultimately transitions to a high, aerial angle, continuing to track the character as they soar forward through the fantastical landscape.",
