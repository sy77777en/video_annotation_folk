    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera trucks right to follow the hunted character, briefly pausing as he evades the airplane's searchlight, before resuming its rightward motion to stay with they.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the requirements. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It is highly accurate in what it describes, but it omits key details that are explicitly required by the caption instructions, specifically regarding camera height and focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**. Every statement it makes correctly describes an aspect of the video.\n\n*   **\"From a level angle...\"**: Correct. The camera is not tilted up or down; it's parallel to the ground.\n*   **\"...the camera trucks right to track a character from the side.\"**: Correct. The camera physically moves horizontally to the right, parallel to the subject, which is the definition of a \"trucking\" shot. The purpose is to \"track\" the character.\n*   **\"The movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking.\"**: Correct. The movement is not perfectly smooth, mimicking a handheld or shoulder-mounted camera, which adds a sense of immediacy.\n*   **\"It briefly pauses as the character evades a searchlight before resuming its rightward motion to keep them in the frame.\"**: Correct. This is an excellent and precise observation of the movement's changing speed and its narrative purpose.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **incomplete**. It successfully describes the camera angle and movement but fails to address other mandatory points from the instructions.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n\n*   **Camera Height:** The instructions ask for height (e.g., *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level*). The camera is positioned at roughly the character's head/shoulder height, which should be described as **eye-level**.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a significant omission. The instructions require a description of depth, focus plane, and focus changes.\n    *   The video clearly has a **shallow depth of field**, as the background is noticeably blurred while the character is sharp.\n    *   The **focus plane** is on the **midground**, where the character is.\n    *   The focus **tracks** the character, keeping them sharp as they move.\n\n**What Was Correctly Omitted:**\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so omitting this was correct per the instructions.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so omitting this was correct.\n*   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so omitting this was correct.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to the Instruction\n\nThe caption adheres well to some instructions but fails on others.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and well-written.\n*   **Describing Movement:** It excels at describing the camera's movement, including its type, direction, steadiness, speed variation, and purpose, just as the instructions requested.\n*   **Covering All Required Elements:** This is where it falls short. It did not provide a \"concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**\" because it left out the required details about **camera height** and **focus**.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the missing information and fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"From an eye-level, level angle, the camera trucks right to track a character from the side. The video features a shallow depth of field, with the focus consistently tracking the character in the midground. The camera movement is slightly unsteady and briefly pauses as the character evades a searchlight before resuming its rightward motion to keep them in the frame.\"**",
