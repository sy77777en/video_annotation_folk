    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video features a man suspended in the air, but the camera's height is unclear due to the zoomed-in frame and lack of background cues.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions. Here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It accurately identifies several key visual elements like the camera angle, depth of field, and lack of intentional movement. However, it misses some required details from the instructions and contains a minor inaccuracy regarding the focus plane.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the **level angle**, the **shallow depth of field**, and the nature of the camera's stability (**fixed** in terms of intentional movement, but with **slight unsteadiness**). This last point is a particularly good and nuanced observation, capturing the feel of a handheld shot trying to be still.\n*   **Minor Inaccuracy:** The caption states the focus is on the man \"in the **foreground**.\" While the man is the primary subject, in terms of spatial depth, he is in the **midground**. The foreground would be the empty space between the camera and the man. The background is the blurry room behind him. Using \"midground\" would be more precise.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThis is the area where the caption falls short of the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Height:** The instructions explicitly ask for **camera height** (e.g., eye-level, hip-level, ground-level). The video is shot from approximately **eye-level** or chest-level, and this is not mentioned in the caption.\n*   **Missing - Video Speed & Lens Distortion (Correctly Omitted):** The caption correctly adheres to the conciseness rule by not mentioning that the video is at regular speed and has no lens distortion, as these are the default states. This is a point in its favor.\n*   **Covered Elements:** The caption successfully covers:\n    *   Camera Angle (`level angle`)\n    *   Focus/Depth of Field (`shallow depth of field`)\n    *   Camera Movement/Steadiness (`fixed`, `slight unsteadiness`)\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Partially Adherent:** The caption follows the spirit of the instructions by being concise and descriptive. It correctly identifies and describes the most prominent camera characteristics.\n*   **Non-Adherence:** It fails to provide a complete description as mandated by the instructions because it omits the **camera height**. It also uses a slightly imprecise term for the **focus plane** (`foreground` instead of `midground`).\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that fully adheres to the instructions, incorporating the necessary corrections and additions:\n\n**\"Shot from a static, eye-level position with a level angle, the handheld camera exhibits a slight wobble. A shallow depth of field keeps the man in the midground in sharp focus while blurring the background.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Adds Camera Height:** It includes \"eye-level\" as requested.\n*   **Corrects Focus Plane:** It accurately identifies the man as being in the \"midground.\"\n*   **Improves Clarity:** It combines the description of the camera's position and angle into a single, efficient opening clause. Using the term \"handheld\" is a strong inference that concisely explains the \"slight wobble.\"",
