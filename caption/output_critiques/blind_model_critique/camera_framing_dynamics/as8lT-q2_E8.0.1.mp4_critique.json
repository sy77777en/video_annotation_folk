    "pre_caption": "Positioned at a level angle, the camera maintains deep focus, keeping the fighting silhouettes and the background screen sharp. It moves forward with slightly unsteady, shaky motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera movement, framing, and focus, it lacks the specificity and technical detail required by the instructions, leaving out key visual elements that would likely be present in such a scene. For instance, a fight scene with silhouettes is often shot in **slow-motion** to emphasize the impact and grace of the movements, a crucial detail about video speed that is missing. The description of movement as \"moves forward\" could be more precisely termed a **dolly-in**, and the \"unsteady, shaky motion\" could be elaborated on; a handheld camera would likely introduce minor, reactive **pans and tilts** to track the fighters' unpredictable actions, as well as a slight **rolling** motion that creates a subtle, fluctuating Dutch angle, enhancing the sense of chaos. The caption mentions an \"eye-level\" height but omits the camera angle; a **low angle** shot would be a common choice to make the silhouetted fighters appear more powerful and imposing. Furthermore, while the shot starts with deep focus, it's improbable that the focus would remain perfectly deep as the camera dollies in and transitions to a medium shot; a more accurate description would note that the depth of field likely becomes **shallower**, causing the background to soften and concentrating the viewer's attention more intensely on the combatants by the end of the shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, positioned at a low angle, captures the fighting silhouettes with an initial deep focus, keeping both the fighters and the background screen sharp. As it dollies in, the camera introduces a slightly unsteady, handheld motion, incorporating minor reactive pans and tilts to follow the fighters' unpredictable movements, along with a subtle rolling motion that creates a fluctuating Dutch angle, enhancing the scene's chaotic energy. The shot is captured in slow-motion, emphasizing the impact and grace of the combat. As the camera moves closer, the depth of field becomes shallower, softening the background and drawing the viewer's attention more intensely to the combatants.",
