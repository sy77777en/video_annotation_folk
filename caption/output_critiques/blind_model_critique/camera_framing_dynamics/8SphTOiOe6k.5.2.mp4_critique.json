    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera captures the street view, trucking left while continuously panning left to align its facing with the moving direction.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the caption based on the provided video and instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, comprehensive in its description of the key elements, and perfectly adheres to the instructions by being both informative and concise.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n**Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"shot at eye level with a level camera angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is positioned at the approximate eye level of a seated person inside a vehicle, looking straight out, so the angle is level with the horizon.\n*   **\"using deep focus for a large depth of field\"**: **Correct.** Everything from the reflections on the window in the immediate foreground to the buildings in the midground and the distant sky is in sharp focus. This is a clear example of deep focus.\n*   **\"The handheld camera...\"**: **Correct.** The subtle, high-frequency jitters and minor sways are characteristic of a camera being held by hand rather than mounted on a tripod or gimbal.\n*   **\"...trucks left, panning left...\"**: **Correct.** The camera is inside a moving vehicle, creating a **trucking left** motion relative to the scenery. There is also a slight **pan left** as the camera adjusts its orientation to follow the passing view.\n*   **\"...to maintain alignment with the movement direction, capturing a street view.\"**: **Correct.** This accurately describes the purpose of the combined movements—to keep the street scene centered as the point of view moves.\n*   **\"The motion is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\"**: **Correct.** This perfectly describes the quality of the handheld movement, which is not perfectly smooth but also not excessively shaky.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption correctly omits details that are not present, such as altered video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle. This follows the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions (e.g., `eye level`, `level camera angle`, `deep focus`, `trucks`, `panning`).\n*   **Required Elements:** The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Height:** `eye level`\n    *   **Camera Angle:** `level camera angle`\n    *   **Focus:** `deep focus for a large depth of field`\n    *   **Movements:** `handheld`, `trucks left`, `panning left`\n    *   **Movement Qualities:** `slightly unsteady with some shaking`\n    *   **Movement Purpose:** `to maintain alignment with the movement direction`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is factually correct in every aspect, uses the specified vocabulary accurately, and includes all necessary information without adding unnecessary fluff. There are no improvements needed.",
