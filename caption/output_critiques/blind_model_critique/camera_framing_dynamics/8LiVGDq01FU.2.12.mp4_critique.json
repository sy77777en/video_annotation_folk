    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery detail in the caption correctly describes the visual information in the video:\n*   **\"hip level with a level angle\":** The camera is held low, around the operator's waist, and is pointed straight ahead, parallel to the ground. This is an accurate assessment of height and angle.\n*   **\"focusing on the man in the foreground using a shallow depth of field\":** The man walking away from the camera is the clear subject and is in sharp focus. The background, including the street and buildings, is distinctly blurred, which is a classic example of a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"moves slowly backward\":** The camera is indeed moving backward (a dolly out) at a slow, deliberate pace to keep a consistent distance from the subject.\n*   **\"slight unsteadiness and some shaking\":** The movement is not perfectly smooth; there is a noticeable handheld quality, with minor jitters and swaying, which is well-described as \"slight unsteadiness and some shaking.\"\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant details required by the instructions while omitting unnecessary information:\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It covers height (`hip level`), angle (`level angle`), focus (`on the man in the foreground`, `shallow depth of field`), and movement (`slowly backward`, `slight unsteadiness`, `shaking`).\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** As per the instructions, it correctly does not mention that the video is at regular speed, has no lens distortion, and lacks a Dutch angle. This demonstrates a good understanding of the conciseness requirement.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and content guidelines precisely:\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs all the key descriptive elements into a single, easy-to-read sentence without being verbose.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses appropriate and specific terms like \"hip level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n*   **Movement Description:** It effectively describes the movement's direction (`backward`), speed (`slowly`), and steadiness (`unsteadiness and shaking`), fulfilling the detailed requirements for describing camera motion.",
