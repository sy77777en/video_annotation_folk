    "pre_caption": "This is a slow-motion video. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, initially at a level angle. It tilts slightly up and zooms in to track the person as they jump from the diving board. As the person dives into the water, the camera slightly pans left and tilts down, changing to a high angle. The camera uses deep focus, keeping everything sharp, and the movement is smooth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera initially tilts slightly up and zooms in to track the person as they jump, then slightly pans left and tilts down as they dive into the water.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject by tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a decent overview, but it contains several inaccuracies and lacks the specificity needed to truly capture the shot's technical execution. The description of the camera angle is contradictory; if the camera is at an \"overhead level,\" it cannot simultaneously be at a \"level angle\" relative to the diver on the board. It would inherently be a high-angle shot from the start. A more likely scenario is that the camera is positioned at a high level, beginning with a high angle on the diver, which then becomes a steeper high angle as it tilts down to follow their descent into the water. Furthermore, the claim of \"deep focus\" is highly improbable for a slow-motion video. Achieving the high frame rates necessary for slow motion requires a wide aperture, which naturally creates a shallow depth of field. In the video, the diver is likely in sharp focus while the background spectators and pool surroundings are softly blurred, a detail your caption misses entirely. You should describe this as a shallow depth of field with focus tracking the subject. Finally, while you mention the video is in slow motion, you could be more precise; many diving videos use a speed ramp, starting at normal speed on the board and transitioning to slow motion mid-air to emphasize the diver's form, which is a more dynamic effect than constant slow motion. The movement described as a \"pan left and tilt down\" might be more accurately portrayed as a single, fluid downward-arcing motion, which better aligns with the \"smooth\" quality you noted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This slow-motion video captures a diver's leap from the board with technical precision. The camera starts at a high level with a high-angle shot, initially focusing on the diver. As the diver jumps, the camera tilts down, following their descent into the water with a steeper high angle. The video employs a speed ramp, beginning at normal speed on the board and transitioning to slow motion mid-air to highlight the diver's form. The camera maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the diver in sharp focus while softly blurring the background spectators and pool surroundings. The movement is a smooth, downward-arcing motion, enhancing the dynamic quality of the shot.",
