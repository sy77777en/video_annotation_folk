    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows a woman in a white dress standing on a rooftop at night, with the moon visible in the background. The scene transitions from out of focus to deep focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect fit for the video and meticulously follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video's technical and visual elements.\n*   **\"slow-motion video\"**: Correct. The movement of the woman's hair, her dress, and the falling confetti clearly indicates that the video is playing in slow motion.\n*   **\"fixed, slightly unsteady\"**: Perfectly accurate. The camera does not pan, tilt, or dolly, so it is \"fixed.\" However, there is a subtle, high-frequency jitter characteristic of a handheld shot, which is well-described as \"slightly unsteady.\"\n*   **\"eye-level camera at a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned at the same height as the subject's upper body, creating an eye-level perspective. The horizon is straight, confirming a level angle.\n*   **\"shot begins out of focus and then transitions to deep focus\"**: Correct. The video starts completely blurry and then pulls focus. The final state has both the midground subject (the woman) and the background cityscape in sharp focus, which is correctly identified as \"deep focus.\"\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is comprehensive, covering all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions without adding unnecessary information.\n*   It correctly identifies the altered **video speed** (slow-motion).\n*   It describes the **camera's position** (eye-level, level angle).\n*   It details the **camera's movement** and **steadiness** (fixed, slightly unsteady).\n*   It accurately describes the dynamic **focus change** from out-of-focus to deep focus.\n*   It correctly omits any mention of lens distortion or Dutch angles, as none are present, thus adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction:\nThe caption flawlessly adheres to every part of the detailed instructions.\n*   **Concise and Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical detail into a clear, easy-to-read sentence without being verbose.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It uses the precise terminology requested, such as \"slow-motion,\" \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Describes Configuration**: It provides a complete picture of the video's and camera's configuration as instructed.\n*   **Handles Omissions Correctly**: By not mentioning regular playback speed, lens distortion, or complex movements, it demonstrates a clear understanding of the instruction to only describe what is present or altered.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary execution of the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and concise, using the correct terminology to perfectly describe the visual and technical characteristics of the shot.",
