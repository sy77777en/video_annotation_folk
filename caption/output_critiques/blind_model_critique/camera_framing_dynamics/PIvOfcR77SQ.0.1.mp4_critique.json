    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both the man in the foreground and the snowy landscape in sharp detail. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the man, with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it describes:\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is not looking up or down at the subject but is positioned straight-on, at approximately the man's chest or shoulder height.\n*   **\"It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping both the man in the foreground and the snowy landscape in sharp detail\"**: This is a perfect description. The man, the nearby trees, and the distant mountains are all in sharp focus, which is the definition of a large depth of field (deep focus).\n*   **\"The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the man\"**: This correctly identifies the complex movement. It is not just a pan; the camera is physically moving in a circle around the subject. The direction is also correct—the background moves from right to left, indicating a clockwise camera path. The movement is indeed very smooth, suggesting a gimbal or similar stabilizer.\n*   **\"with minimal shaking\"**: This is accurate. The shot is extremely stable.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption effectively includes all necessary information while correctly omitting what is not present, as per the instructions.\n*   **Included**: It covers camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and the primary camera movement (arcing, direction, steadiness).\n*   **Correctly Omitted**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions needed to be described.\n\nThe caption successfully provides a \"concise yet informative description\" by focusing only on the relevant and observable characteristics of the shot.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness**: It conveys a significant amount of technical information in just three clear sentences.\n*   **Terminology**: It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as **\"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"large depth of field,\"** and **\"arcs clockwise.\"** Using \"arcs\" instead of a less specific term like \"moves around\" shows excellent adherence.\n*   **Structure**: The description is logically structured, first establishing the static properties of the shot (position, focus) before describing the dynamic movement.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is factually correct, includes all the pertinent details without unnecessary fluff, and uses the specified technical language precisely.",
