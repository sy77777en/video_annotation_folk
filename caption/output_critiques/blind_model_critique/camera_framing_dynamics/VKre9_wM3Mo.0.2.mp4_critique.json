    "pre_caption": "The video is captured from an overhead, bird's-eye view at approximately second-floor height, looking directly down at a toilet. The camera uses deep focus, keeping all elements in sharp detail. There is minor, very smooth upward camera movement, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it provides:\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** \"overhead, bird's-eye view at approximately second-floor height\" is a precise description. The camera is positioned directly above the subject, looking straight down, from a significant height.\n*   **Focus:** \"deep focus, keeping all elements in sharp detail\" is correct. The toilet, the water inside it, and the surrounding floor tiles are all in sharp focus with no visible background or foreground blur.\n*   **Movement & Steadiness:** \"minor, very smooth upward camera movement, maintaining steadiness\" is a perfect description. There is a slow, subtle upward drift (a pedestal up) that is completely steady, with no shaking or wobbling.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption effectively includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what isn't relevant, as per the instructions:\n*   **Key Elements Covered:** It successfully identifies and describes the most important and noticeable configurations: camera angle, height, focus, and movement.\n*   **Omissions:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video plays at a regular speed, so the caption correctly omits any mention of time-lapse or slow-motion.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible lens distortion, so this is correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The frame is level, so there is no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\nBy including only the relevant details, the caption remains concise and informative.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs all the necessary technical details into two clear, well-structured sentences without any unnecessary words.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It correctly uses terms from the instructions like \"overhead,\" \"bird's-eye view,\" and \"deep focus.\" While it uses the general term \"upward camera movement\" instead of the more technical \"pedestal up,\" this is perfectly acceptable as it clearly conveys the action.\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the movement as \"minor, very smooth\" and \"maintaining steadiness\" is clear and easy to understand.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is accurate in its technical assessment, complete in its coverage of relevant features, and perfectly concise, making it an excellent description of the video's configuration.",
