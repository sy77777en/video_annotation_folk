    "pre_caption": "From a side-on perspective, the camera smoothly tracks the red, square-shaped character as it falls down a long, narrow vertical shaft. As the character exits the shaft at the bottom, the camera makes a subtle leftward movement to keep it centered in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera follows the subject all the way down from a side view, with a subtle leftward movement as the subject exits the tunnel.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is a good starting point, but it is not a good caption because it is incomplete and fails to adhere to several key requirements of the instruction.\n\n### Feedback\n\n**Accuracy:**\n*   **What it gets right:** The caption is factually accurate. The camera does have a \"side-on perspective,\" it \"smoothly tracks\" the character, and it makes a \"subtle leftward movement\" at the end to keep the character centered. The description of the subject and its action is also correct.\n\n**Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption fails to include several mandatory descriptive elements outlined in the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Movement Terminology:** The caption uses the general term \"tracks\" for the vertical movement. While not incorrect, the instructions ask for specific movement types. The primary downward movement is a **pedestal down**. The final horizontal adjustment is a **truck left**. Using this precise terminology is a key requirement.\n*   **Missing - Camera Angle & Height:** The caption mentions a \"side-on perspective\" but does not specify the **camera angle** (`level angle`) or describe the dynamic **camera height**. The camera's height changes continuously as it moves down the shaft, which is a crucial detail that was omitted.\n*   **Missing - Focus and Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The instructions explicitly state: \"If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera).\" This video is a 2D animation with a completely flat look and **no depth of field**. Every element is in sharp focus. This critical detail, which defines the shot's artificial nature, is completely missing from the caption.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is too simplistic for the detailed instructions provided. It describes what a casual viewer might see but fails to provide the technical breakdown of the camera's configuration and movement that was explicitly requested. It lacks the required specificity in terminology (pedestal, truck, level angle) and completely omits the mandatory description of the artificial focus and depth of field.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is an example of a caption that correctly follows all the given instructions:\n\n\"From a **level, side-on angle**, the camera **smoothly pedestals down** to track a red, square-shaped character falling through a vertical shaft. The shot has **no depth of field**, with all elements in sharp focus, characteristic of a 2D animation. As the character exits the shaft, the camera performs a subtle **truck left** to maintain a central framing.\"",
