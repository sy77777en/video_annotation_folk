    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good and largely accurate, but it could be slightly more precise regarding the focus.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **\"The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle.\"** - **Accurate.** The camera is positioned at a height comparable to a standing person's eye level, and the shot is framed with a straight, level horizon.\n*   **\"It uses a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field.\"** - **Partially Inaccurate.** While the depth of field is not shallow, \"deep focus\" is a strong term that implies everything from the foreground to the distant background is perfectly sharp. In the video, the subject in the midground is sharp, but the background elements (like the window) are noticeably softer and slightly out of focus. A more precise description would be a **moderate depth of field** with the focus plane on the **midground**.\n*   **\"The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\"** - **Highly Accurate.** This perfectly describes the shot. The camera does not pan, tilt, or dolly, but there is a subtle, high-frequency shake, indicating it's likely handheld or on an unstable surface.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise and effective, successfully summarizing the key camera properties in just two sentences.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** It correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or a **Dutch angle**, as these are all standard/absent in the video. This demonstrates a good understanding of the instruction to only mention non-default attributes.\n*   **Required Elements:** The caption successfully covers the required elements:\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"eye level\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level angle\"\n    *   **Focus/Depth of Field:** \"deep focus, keeping a large depth of field\"\n    *   **Movement/Steadiness:** \"fixed but slightly unsteady\"\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe caption is very good because it is concise, informative, and correctly identifies most of the key technical aspects of the shot while adhering to the negative constraints of the instructions (i.e., what not to mention). The only point of improvement is the characterization of the focus, which is slightly overstated.\n\n**A slightly improved version for maximum accuracy would be:**\n\n\"The camera is at eye level and maintains a level angle, with the focus set on the midground subject, creating a moderate depth of field. The shot is static and has no intentional movement, though it is slightly unsteady.\"",
