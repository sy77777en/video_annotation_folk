    "pre_caption": "The video features a smooth, aerial camera shot at a high angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera glides forward and tilts downward in a diving motion, smoothly passing over a hot air balloon. The landscape below reveals a snowy, forested area with winding roads, set in Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward while tilting down in a diving motion past the hot air balloon.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a high-quality and effective description of the video that successfully adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video features a smooth, aerial camera shot at a high angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera glides forward and tilts downward in a diving motion, smoothly passing over a hot air balloon. The landscape below reveals a snowy, forested area with winding roads, set in Levi, Arctic Circle, Finland.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its description of the video's technical and visual elements.\n\n*   **\"smooth, aerial camera shot at a high angle\"**: Correct. The shot is taken from a drone or similar aerial platform, it is perfectly stabilized (smooth), and it looks down on the subject from a high angle.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. All elements, from the hot air balloon in the midground to the distant trees and roads in the background, are sharp and in focus.\n*   **\"glides forward and tilts downward in a diving motion\"**: This is a perfect description of the camera's complex movement. It correctly identifies the two primary actions (translation forward and rotation downward) and uses the descriptive term \"diving motion\" to capture their combined effect.\n*   **\"smoothly passing over a hot air balloon\"**: Accurately describes the camera's path relative to the main subject.\n*   **\"landscape below reveals...\"**: This accurately describes the setting and content of the shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Excellent\n\nThe caption is comprehensive, covering all the relevant aspects required by the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **Included Elements:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"aerial\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"high angle\"\n    *   **Movements:** \"glides forward and tilts downward\"\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"smooth\"\n    *   **Focus/Depth:** \"deep focus with a large depth of field\"\n    *   **Complexity/Purpose:** The \"diving motion\" to pass over the balloon is well-described.\n\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is fixed, so there is no need to describe a rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot.\n\nThe caption successfully provides a complete picture of the camera's configuration without unnecessary clutter.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\n\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into two clear, readable sentences. It avoids jargon where simpler terms work better (e.g., \"glides forward\" instead of \"dollies in,\" which is more appropriate for a drone).\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It correctly uses key terms like \"aerial,\" \"high angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"tilts downward.\"\n*   **Omission Rule:** It demonstrates a perfect understanding of the instruction to omit descriptions of unaltered or non-existent features (like regular speed and lack of distortion).\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It goes beyond a dry technical list by using evocative language like \"diving motion,\" which enhances the description while remaining accurate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly concise, resulting in a description that is both technically precise and easy for a general audience to understand. No improvements are necessary.",
