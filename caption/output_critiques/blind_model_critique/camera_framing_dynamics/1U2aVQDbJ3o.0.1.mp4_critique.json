    "pre_caption": "The video features an aerial-level camera starting with a bird's-eye view, transitioning to a high angle as it tracks a red car. The camera smoothly spirals down counterclockwise, tilting up slightly, with a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field, and the movement is smooth and steady, enhancing the visual engagement as the subject becomes larger in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks a red car from a top-down aerial view, smoothly spiraling down counterclockwise and tilting up slightly as it gets closer to the ground, creating a visually engaging motion.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption correctly identifies and describes every key technical aspect of the shot:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** It accurately starts at an **aerial-level** with a **bird's-eye view** and correctly notes the transition to a **high angle** as the camera descends.\n*   **Subject & Movement:** It correctly identifies the subject as a \"red car\" and the primary movement as **tracking**.\n*   **Complex Movement:** The description \"smoothly spirals down counterclockwise\" is a brilliant and concise way to combine three distinct movements: **arcing** (circling), **pedestaling/craning down** (descending), and **tracking** (following the car). The direction \"counterclockwise\" is also correct.\n*   **Rotation:** It correctly identifies the subtle **upward tilt** needed to keep the car framed as the camera gets lower, and astutely points out the **varying Dutch angle** caused by the camera **rolling**. This is a sophisticated observation that many would miss.\n*   **Focus:** The description of **deep focus** with a **large depth of field** is spot-on. The car, the road, the surrounding trees, and even the distant landscape are all sharp and in focus.\n*   **Steadiness & Purpose:** It correctly notes the movement is **smooth and steady** (likely a drone with a gimbal) and provides a valid interpretation of the movement's purpose: \"enhancing the visual engagement as the subject becomes larger in the frame.\"\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully covers all the required elements from the instructions while correctly omitting those that are not present:\n*   **Covered:** Camera Configuration (height, angle, movement, focus) is described in comprehensive detail.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly left out as per the instructions.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions perfectly:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a tremendous amount of technical information into a single, well-structured sentence without feeling cluttered or overly academic.\n*   **Proper Terminology:** It uses the precise vocabulary requested in the instructions (e.g., `aerial-level`, `bird's-eye view`, `tracking`, `tilting`, `rolling`, `Dutch angle`, `deep focus`).\n*   **Logical Flow:** The description follows a logical order, starting with the initial setup and then describing the continuous, complex movement and its characteristics.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is not just a list of technical attributes but a well-written, descriptive sentence that accurately and elegantly captures the dynamic and cinematic nature of the shot.",
