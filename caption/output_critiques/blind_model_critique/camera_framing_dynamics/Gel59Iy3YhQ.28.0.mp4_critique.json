    "pre_caption": "From a smooth, aerial, low-angle perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The first-person view in the sandbox game moves slightly forward and tilts up, then moves backward as blocks are placed. Finally, it moves forward again to destroy the excess blocks.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows the first-person perspective in a sandbox game, starting with a slight forward movement followed by a subtle upward tilt. It then moves backward to place blocks, and at the end, it slightly moves forward to destroy the excess blocks.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it contains significant inaccuracies and contradictions regarding the camera's fundamental configuration, even though it correctly describes the sequence of actions.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy: **Poor**\n\n*   **Major Contradiction:** The caption describes the perspective as **\"aerial, low-angle\"**. This is a direct contradiction.\n    *   **Aerial** implies a very high position, looking down (like from a drone or plane).\n    *   **Low-angle** implies a position below the subject, looking up.\n*   **Incorrect Description:** A **\"first-person view\"** in a game like this is almost always at **eye-level** with a **level angle** (looking straight ahead). The caption completely misidentifies both the camera height and angle, which are core components of the shot's configuration.\n*   **Accurate Elements:** The caption is likely accurate in stating the camera is **\"smooth\"** (typical for game recordings), has a **\"deep focus\"** (standard for game rendering), and correctly describes the sequence of movements (forward, tilt up, backward, forward).\n\n#### Completeness: **Incomplete**\n\n*   The caption fails to provide a complete and correct picture of the camera's setup due to the inaccurate description of its height and angle.\n*   It successfully covers movement, steadiness, and focus.\n*   It correctly follows the instruction to omit details about normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and lack of a Dutch angle, which contributes to its conciseness.\n\n#### Adherence to Instruction: **Partial**\n\n*   The caption attempts to follow the instructions by covering the specified elements (angle, height, movement, focus). However, it fails the primary goal of providing an **\"informative description\"** because the information it gives about the camera's position is wrong.\n*   It successfully describes the camera movements chronologically and includes their purpose (\"as blocks are placed,\" \"to destroy the excess blocks\").\n*   The language is simple (\"moves forward\") rather than technical (\"dollies in\"), which is acceptable, but the fundamental errors in describing the shot's static properties make it a poor caption.\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nA much better caption would accurately describe the standard first-person perspective and then detail the movements.\n\n**Improved Example:**\n\n> \"From a smooth, **eye-level, first-person perspective** with a **level angle**, the camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera first **dollies slightly forward and tilts up**, then **dollies backward** as blocks are placed. Finally, it **dollies forward** again to destroy the excess blocks.\"",
