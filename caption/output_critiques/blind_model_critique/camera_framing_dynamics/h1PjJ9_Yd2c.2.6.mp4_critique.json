    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as being at **eye level** with a **level camera angle**. The perspective is straight-on, consistent with someone holding a camera at a natural height.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The description of a **shallow depth of field** with focus on the **foreground** is precise. The subject is sharp, while the background is clearly and intentionally blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of **\"minor, slightly unsteady movement with some shaking, but no clear or intentional motion\"** is excellent. It accurately captures the nature of a handheld shot where the operator is attempting to remain stationary. It correctly avoids labeling the subtle drift as a deliberate pan or track.\n\n### Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids mentioning standard or absent features, as instructed. It correctly omits any mention of video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (which is not present), or Dutch angles.\n*   **Required Elements:** It successfully covers all the relevant configurations present in the video:\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"eye level\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level camera angle\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground\"\n    *   **Movement:** It provides a nuanced description of the camera's steadiness and lack of intentional movement.\n\nThe caption effectively synthesizes the visual information into a description that is both technically precise and easy to understand, perfectly matching the goal of the instructions.",
