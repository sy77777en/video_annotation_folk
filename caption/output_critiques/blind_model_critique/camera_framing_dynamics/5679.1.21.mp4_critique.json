    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good and captures the main essence of the shot. It is accurate in its general descriptions. However, it could be more precise and technically complete by using the specific terminology outlined in the instructions, particularly regarding camera movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"overhead, bird's-eye view\"**: **Accurate.** The camera is positioned directly above the subjects, looking straight down, which perfectly fits this description.\n*   **\"with deep focus\"**: **Accurate.** All elements in the frame—the person, the dog, and the grass—are sharp and in focus. There is no shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"capturing a large dog and a person lying on the grass\"**: **Accurate, but...** This describes the *content* of the video, not the camera's configuration. The instructions ask for a description of the *video's and camera's configuration*. While this context is helpful, a caption strictly following the rules would focus only on the technical aspects.\n*   **\"positioned at a second-floor height\"**: **Accurate.** This is a reasonable and effective estimation of the camera's starting height.\n*   **\"moves smoothly upward\"**: **Partially Accurate.** The camera does move upward, but it also moves backward simultaneously, pulling away from the subjects. The description is correct but incomplete.\n*   **\"maintaining a steady shot\"**: **Accurate.** The movement is perfectly smooth with no shaking or wobbling.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing:** The caption lacks the specific terminology for the camera movement requested in the instructions.\n    *   The combined upward and backward motion is best described as a **crane up and away** or **pedestaling up while dollying backward**. The term \"moves smoothly upward\" is too generic and misses the backward motion.\n*   **What's Correctly Omitted:** The caption correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is none.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The shot is level.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static.\n    *   This shows good adherence to the conciseness rule of not mentioning unchanged or standard parameters.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   It correctly identifies and describes the **camera angle**, **camera height**, **focus**, and **steadiness**.\n    *   It is concise and avoids mentioning parameters that are not present (e.g., distortion, speed changes).\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Movement Description:** The primary weakness is the failure to use the specific movement vocabulary (**craning, pedestaling, dollying**) provided in the instructions. The description is functional but not as technically precise as requested.\n    *   **Content vs. Configuration:** The caption includes a description of the subjects (\"a large dog and a person\"), which deviates from the strict focus on **camera configuration**.\n\n### Revised Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely follows the instructions, incorporating the feedback above:\n\n**\"From an overhead, bird's-eye view at an initial second-floor height, the camera steadily cranes up and away. The shot maintains a deep focus throughout the movement.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **More Precise Movement:** \"Cranes up and away\" accurately and concisely describes the smooth, combined upward and backward motion.\n*   **Focus on Configuration:** It removes the description of the subjects to focus purely on the technical camera and video properties, as instructed.\n*   **Technical and Concise:** It uses the specific terminology requested while remaining clear and easy to understand.",
