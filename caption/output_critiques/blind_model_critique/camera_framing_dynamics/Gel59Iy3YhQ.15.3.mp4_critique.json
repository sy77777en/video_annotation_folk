    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, the caption is **not good**.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n*   It is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement \"The camera remains completely static\" without seeing the video.\n*   However, for the purpose of this evaluation, let's assume the video does indeed feature a static camera. In that case, the statement itself is factually correct, but it is far from a complete description.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is extremely incomplete. It only addresses one of the many required descriptive points (camera movement) and ignores all others.\n\n**Missing Information:**\n*   **Camera Angle:** The caption fails to mention if the shot is from a `low angle`, `high angle`, `level angle`, etc.\n*   **Camera Height:** There is no description of the camera's height, such as `eye-level`, `ground-level`, or `overhead`.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The caption does not describe if the focus is `deep` (everything is sharp) or `shallow` (background/foreground is blurry), nor does it specify the `focus plane` (e.g., \"focus is on the subject in the midground\").\n*   **Video Speed:** While the instructions state to omit this if it's regular speed, a comprehensive description for a static shot would ideally include the other key elements to compensate.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** Similarly, this is likely omitted because none is present, but the absence of other details makes the caption feel empty.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption writer seems to have misinterpreted a specific instruction while ignoring the overall goal.\n\n*   The instructions state: \"If the camera is static, simply state that the shot is static.\"\n*   The writer followed this specific rule literally but failed to understand it in the context of the broader instruction: \"Provide a concise yet **informative description** of the video’s and camera’s configuration, covering... **camera angle, camera height... and focus**.\"\n\nThe instruction to \"simply state that the shot is static\" is meant to replace the detailed description of *movement* (panning, tilting, tracking, etc.), not to replace the entire description of the shot's configuration. The goal is still to provide an informative overview.\n\n### Example of a Good Caption for a Static Shot:\n\nA good caption would integrate the static nature of the shot with the other required visual details. For example:\n\n*   **Example 1 (Deep Focus):** \"This is a static, eye-level shot with a level angle. The focus is deep, keeping all elements from the foreground to the background in sharp detail.\"\n*   **Example 2 (Shallow Focus):** \"The camera is static in this low-angle, ground-level shot. It uses a shallow depth of field to isolate the subject in the foreground, leaving the background completely blurred.\"\n\nThese examples follow all instructions: they state the camera is static, but also provide the required information on angle, height, and focus, resulting in a concise yet highly informative description.",
