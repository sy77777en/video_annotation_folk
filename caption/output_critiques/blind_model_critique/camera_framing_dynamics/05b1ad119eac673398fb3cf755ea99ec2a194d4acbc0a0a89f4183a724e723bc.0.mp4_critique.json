    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at hip level with a high angle, looking down at the beach scene.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera smoothly wobbles while showing the scenery in front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a decent starting point but is **not good** because it is both inaccurate in its description of movement and incomplete according to the specific requirements of the instructions. It correctly identifies the camera's position and focus but fails to describe the primary camera motion, which is a key element of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"hip level with a high angle\" is a correct assessment. The camera is held low and pointed downward.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus, ensuring all elements, including the rocks and waves, remain sharp\" is perfectly accurate. The foreground rocks and background waves are all in focus.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"minimal shaking\" is a fair description. The movement is not jarring, but it's also not perfectly stable.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Misleading:**\n    *   **Camera Motion:** The caption describes the motion as a \"smooth, slow wobble.\" This is misleading. The primary motion is a **dolly forward**, as the camera is physically moving forward through the scene. The \"wobble\" is a secondary characteristic of the handheld movement, not the movement itself. Calling it \"smooth\" is also slightly contradictory to \"wobble\"; a more precise term would be a \"natural\" or \"handheld\" wobble.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (Adherence to Instructions)\n\nThe caption misses several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Missing Movement Type:** The instructions explicitly ask to describe movements like *dollying*, *trucking*, *panning*, etc. The caption fails to identify the clear **dolly forward** movement.\n*   **Missing Movement Direction:** The caption doesn't state that the camera is moving **forward**. It only describes the quality of the motion (\"wobble\"), not its vector.\n*   **Missing Focus Plane Details:** While it correctly identifies \"deep focus,\" it doesn't specify that the focus plane covers the **foreground, midground, and background**, as suggested by the instructions.\n*   **Missing Purpose of Movement:** The instruction asks for the purpose of the movement. The caption's \"capturing the scenery in front\" is too generic. A more specific purpose would be \"to move the viewer through the rocky shoreline\" or \"to create a sense of walking and exploration.\"\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption (Example of a Better Caption)\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n**\"From a hip-level, high-angle perspective, the camera slowly dollies forward with a natural handheld wobble. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the foreground rocks, midground waves, and distant background sharp throughout the slow, exploratory movement.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Specifies Movement Type:** Clearly identifies the \"dolly forward\" motion.\n*   **Describes Steadiness Accurately:** Uses \"natural handheld wobble,\" which is more precise than \"smooth wobble.\"\n*   **Adds Detail on Focus:** Mentions the foreground, midground, and background to elaborate on the \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Implies Purpose:** The term \"exploratory movement\" gives the motion a clear purpose, adhering to the instructions.\n*   **Concise:** It remains concise while packing in all the required information.",
