    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of the camera being at **eye level** and at a **level angle** is correct. The camera is positioned straight-on, looking directly at the subject.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption accurately identifies the focus on the **astronaut in the midground**. The use of \"**extremely shallow depth of field**\" is precise, as the background is completely blurred, effectively isolating the subject. The statement that this \"emphasiz[es] the subject\" is a correct interpretation of the technique's purpose.\n*   **Camera Movement and Steadiness:** The description \"**fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement**\" is a nuanced and highly accurate observation. While the camera's position is static (no panning, tilting, etc.), there is a subtle high-frequency jitter, which \"slightly unsteady\" captures perfectly.\n\n### Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and follows the instruction to omit default settings. It correctly does not mention video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (which is absent), or a Dutch angle (which is not used).\n*   **Required Elements:** It successfully covers all the relevant, non-default configurations requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"eye level\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level angle\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"focusing on the astronaut in the midground with an extremely shallow depth of field\"\n    *   **Movement/Steadiness:** \"fixed but slightly unsteady\"\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear, professional, and easy to understand, providing a comprehensive technical summary of the shot in a single, well-structured sentence.",
