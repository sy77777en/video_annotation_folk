    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, in a top-down oblique view, remains stationary as the game character prepares to hit the golf ball. After the hit, it moves downward to follow the ball's trajectory. As the ball approaches the hole, the camera shakes slightly when it hits the flagpost, adding a dynamic and immersive touch.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good. It contains a major contradiction and is incomplete, failing to adhere to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its flaws:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Major Contradiction:** The caption begins by describing the camera as **\"static\"** but then immediately states that **\"the camera follows the golf ball's trajectory downward.\"** A camera that follows a moving object is, by definition, not static. This is a fundamental error. The camera is performing a **tracking** movement, likely by **tilting down**.\n*   **Vague Terminology:** While \"top-down oblique perspective\" conveys the general idea, the instructions provide more standard terms like **\"high angle\"** or **\"bird's-eye view,\"** which would be more precise.\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The description of the camera shake upon impact is accurate and correctly identifies its purpose (\"adding a dynamic effect\").\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Missing Focus Information:** The caption completely omits any description of the **focus and depth of field**, which is a required element in the instructions. It should specify if the focus is deep (everything is sharp) or shallow (background is blurry) and if the focus plane changes.\n*   **Incomplete Movement Description:** The caption fails to properly classify the movement. Instead of just \"follows,\" it should use more descriptive terms from the instructions, such as **\"tilts down\"** or **\"pedestals down\"** to track the ball.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption fails to provide an informative description of the camera's configuration due to the contradictory and missing information.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion (assuming they are normal/absent), but its failure to describe movement and focus accurately makes it a poor caption.\n\n---\n\n### A Better Caption Example:\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n\"From a static, high-angle perspective, the camera tilts down to track the golf ball as it falls toward the hole. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the ball and the green sharp. The camera shakes slightly upon impact with the flagpost.\"",
