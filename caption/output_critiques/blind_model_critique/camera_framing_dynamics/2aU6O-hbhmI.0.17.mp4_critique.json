    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle changes throughout the video but is mostly level, occasionally tilting slightly upward to create a low-angle perspective.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone primarily flies forward, occasionally performing brief, random clockwise and counterclockwise rolls, as if someone is testing its motion controls.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good starting point and correctly identifies several key aspects of the video, such as the lens distortion, camera height, and depth of field. However, it significantly misinterprets the camera's movement, particularly the purpose and nature of the rolls, and omits several other critical movements, leading to an inaccurate and incomplete description.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The wide-angle lens of the FPV drone creates significant barrel/fisheye distortion.\n    *   **\"The camera is at an aerial level\"**: Correct. The drone is flying, so it's not at a human-centric height.\n    *   **\"It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. Everything from the foreground railings to the background windows is in sharp focus, which is typical for the small sensors and wide lenses used in FPV drones.\n    *   **\"The drone primarily flies forward, smoothly\"**: This is also accurate. The primary direction of travel is forward, and the flight is exceptionally smooth, indicating a skilled pilot.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"...with the angle mostly level but occasionally tilting slightly upward for a low-angle perspective.\"**: This is incomplete. The camera tilts both **up and down** significantly to navigate the environment, such as when ascending the stairs (tilting up) and descending through openings (tilting down).\n    *   **\"...with brief, random clockwise and counterclockwise rolls...\"**: This is the most significant inaccuracy. The rolls are **not random**. They are deliberate, controlled maneuvers used to execute **banked turns**. Just like an airplane, the FPV drone rolls into a turn to change direction smoothly and maintain momentum. The rolls are a fundamental part of skilled FPV piloting.\n    *   **\"...as if testing motion controls.\"**: This interpretation is incorrect. The purpose of the rolls is not to test controls but to perform precise, fluid navigation through a complex space. Attributing it to \"testing\" misunderstands the high level of skill on display.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing (based on the instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The caption doesn't mention the video speed. While it is regular speed, the instructions state to specify if it's altered. Since it's not, omitting it is acceptable per the conciseness rule (\"there is no need to mention these\").\n    *   **Other Movements:** The caption drastically oversimplifies the camera movement. It correctly identifies the forward dolly and the rolls but completely omits:\n        *   **Panning:** The camera constantly pans left and right to look into turns and change direction.\n        *   **Tilting:** As mentioned, significant up and down tilts are used for vertical navigation.\n        *   **Trucking (sideways) and Pedestaling (vertical):** The drone makes constant small left/right and up/down adjustments to its flight path that are more than just rotation.\n    *   **Complexity and Purpose:** The caption fails to capture the true complexity and purpose of the movement. The flight path is a highly choreographed \"one-shot\" tour, designed to be immersive and showcase both the architecture and the pilot's skill. The caption's description of \"random rolls\" misses this entirely.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot (a \"oner\"). While not a transition, this is a key feature of the video's configuration that adds to its complexity and could be mentioned.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully uses some of the specified terminology like **fisheye distortion**, **aerial level**, and **deep focus**.\n*   It attempts to describe **movements (translation, rotation)** and their **steadiness (smoothly)**.\n*   However, it fails to accurately describe the **complexity** and **purpose** of the movements, which is a key part of the instructions. It mislabels intentional, skillful maneuvers as \"random.\"\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n**This real-time, single-shot video is filmed from an FPV drone, resulting in prominent fisheye distortion. The camera is at an aerial level and maintains deep focus, keeping the entire environment sharp. The movement is complex and continuous: the camera primarily dollies forward smoothly, while constantly panning to navigate corners, tilting up and down to change elevation, and executing controlled rolls to perform fluid, banked turns. The purpose of this intricate flight path is to provide a dynamic and immersive architectural tour.**",
