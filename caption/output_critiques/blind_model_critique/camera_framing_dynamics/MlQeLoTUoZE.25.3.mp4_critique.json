    "pre_caption": "This eye-level shot begins with a static camera at a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the midground. The camera then moves backward while tilting up, with some slight shaking. As it moves, it uses focus tracking to keep the mesh soldier in the foreground sharp, shifting the focus plane and changing the camera to a low angle.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera starts focused on the midground, and later becomes focused on the foreground. The camera uses focus tracking to keep the subject in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** After remaining static for a moment, the camera moves backward while tilting up to maintain focus on the mesh soldier.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\nOverall, the caption is good and captures the general essence of the shot, but it contains a significant terminological error regarding the focus change and omits one of the camera's movements.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy: Good, with a key error.**\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   The description of the initial shot is perfect: \"eye-level shot begins with a static camera at a level angle, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the midground.\" This correctly identifies the height, angle, initial lack of movement, DoF, and focus plane.\n    *   The description of the final state is also correct: the camera ends at a \"low angle.\"\n    *   The description of the camera's steadiness (\"slight shaking\") is accurate.\n    *   The identification of the backward movement and upward tilt is correct.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   The most significant error is the term **\"focus tracking.\"** Focus tracking is when the camera automatically maintains focus on a subject as it moves toward or away from the camera. What happens in this video is a **rack focus** (or focus pull). The focus deliberately *shifts* from one subject (the person in the midground) to a different subject at a different distance (the mesh soldier in the foreground).\n    *   The phrase \"to keep the mesh soldier in the foreground sharp\" is misleading. The soldier begins the shot out of focus and *becomes* sharp as a result of the rack focus. The action is not \"keeping\" it sharp, but \"making\" it sharp.\n\n#### **Completeness: Mostly complete, but missing one movement.**\n\n*   The caption correctly identifies that the camera moves backward (\"dolly out\") and tilts up.\n*   However, it misses that the camera also moves **vertically upward** (a \"pedestal up\" or \"crane up\" motion). The camera doesn't just tilt from a fixed point; the entire camera body elevates, which is what allows it to look down on the person in the midground and then up at the soldier from a higher final position.\n*   A complete description of the movement would be: \"The camera dollies backward, pedestals upward, and tilts upward simultaneously.\"\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions: Good.**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary information, as instructed (e.g., it doesn't mention the normal video speed or lack of lens distortion).\n*   **Terminology:** It uses correct terminology for camera height, angle, and depth of field. However, the incorrect use of \"focus tracking\" instead of \"rack focus\" is a notable failure to adhere to the instruction for precise descriptions of camera movements and focus changes.\n*   **Structure:** It correctly describes the initial static phase and then the movement phase, following a logical temporal order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a solid attempt that correctly identifies many key aspects of the shot. Its primary weakness is the misidentification of the rack focus as focus tracking, which changes the described intent and mechanism of the focus change. Its secondary weakness is the omission of the vertical \"pedestal\" movement.\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and omissions, providing a more precise and complete description according to your instructions:\n\n**This eye-level, level-angle shot begins static, using a shallow depth of field to focus on the person in the midground. The camera then simultaneously dollies backward and pedestals upward while tilting up, exhibiting slight shaking. During this movement, a rack focus shifts the focus plane from the midground to the mesh figure in the foreground. The shot ends at a low angle, holding sharp focus on the foreground figure.**",
