    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good, accurate summary of the video's content and primary camera action, but it is **incomplete** according to the detailed instructions provided. It successfully describes the movement's type, speed, and steadiness but omits several other required technical specifications.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy:\n*   **\"The camera slowly and smoothly zooms out...\"**: This is **highly accurate**. The movement is a zoom-out, and its execution is both slow and perfectly smooth (indicative of a digital move rather than a physical camera).\n*   **\"...from a map that displays the flight path of Flight 93, its crash site, and its proximity to Washington.\"**: This is an **accurate** description of the visual content being revealed.\n\nThe caption is factually correct in what it chooses to describe.\n\n#### 2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:\n\nHere is a breakdown of what the caption included versus what it missed from the instructions:\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed. The instruction states not to mention this if it's normal. **The caption correctly omits this.** (Good)\n*   **Lens Distortion:** There is no distortion. **The caption correctly omits this.** (Good)\n*   **Camera Angle:** The video uses a **bird's-eye view**. This is a mandatory detail that is **missing** from the caption.\n*   **Camera Height:** The shot is from an **overhead-level** perspective, looking straight down at the 2D graphic. This is **missing**.\n*   **Movements:**\n    *   **Type:** \"zooms out\" - **Covered.**\n    *   **Speed:** \"slowly\" - **Covered.**\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"smoothly\" - **Covered.**\n    *   **Purpose:** The purpose (to show the flight's context relative to Washington) is implied by the description of the content, but not explicitly stated as the *reason* for the movement. This could be slightly more direct.\n    *   **Complexity:** It correctly identifies the single, simple movement.\n*   **Focus / Depth of Field:** The video is a 2D graphic animation. As such, it has no realistic depth of field; everything is in **deep focus** or, more accurately, uniformly sharp. This is a key characteristic of the shot's configuration that is **missing** from the caption.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good for a general audience but fails to meet the specific, technical requirements of the instructions. It successfully captures the most obvious camera action but omits the required details about camera angle, height, and focus, which are essential for a complete technical description as requested.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that fully adheres to the instructions:\n\n**\"From a bird's-eye, overhead-level angle, the camera performs a slow and smooth digital zoom-out on a 2D map. The purpose of the movement is to reveal the full context of Flight 93's flight path, its crash site, and its proximity to Washington, D.C. As it is a 2D graphic, the entire image remains in sharp focus with no depth of field.\"**",
