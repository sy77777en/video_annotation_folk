    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera initially focuses on a man playing golf, then gradually moves backward, occasionally panning left to reveal the entire scene.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and concise.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nEvery detail mentioned in the caption is a precise and correct observation of the video:\n\n*   **\"smooth, eye-level perspective with a level angle\"**: The camera is perfectly steady (`smooth`), positioned at the height of a standing person (`eye-level`), and is not tilted up or down (`level angle`).\n*   **\"maintains a deep focus\"**: Both the golfer in the foreground and the trees/buildings in the background are sharp and in focus throughout the shot, which correctly defines `deep focus`. The focus does not change.\n*   **\"begins on a man playing golf\"**: This accurately describes the initial framing of the shot.\n*   **\"gradually dollies backward while panning left\"**: This is a perfect technical description of the camera's complex movement. The camera physically moves away from the subject (`dollies backward`) while simultaneously rotating horizontally to the left (`panning left`). The word `gradually` correctly captures the slow, controlled speed of the movement.\n*   **\"to reveal the full scene\"**: This correctly identifies the **purpose** of the camera movement, which is to transition from a medium shot of the action to a wide shot that establishes the setting.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting what isn't present, as per the instructions:\n\n*   **Included Elements**: It covers camera height, angle, steadiness, focus, and a detailed breakdown of the camera's movement (type, direction, speed, complexity, and purpose).\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly)**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful understanding of the instructions:\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical detail into two clear, easy-to-read sentences without any wasted words.\n*   **Use of Technical Language**: It correctly uses specific terms like `dolly`, `pan`, and `deep focus`, showing a strong grasp of cinematography vocabulary.\n*   **Structured Description**: It logically describes the static elements of the shot first (perspective, focus) before detailing the dynamic movement in chronological order.\n*   **Purposeful Description**: It goes beyond just describing *what* the camera does by explaining *why* it does it (\"to reveal the full scene\"), adding a layer of analytical depth.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a perfect execution of the prompt. It is technically accurate, includes all relevant information while omitting the irrelevant, and is written in a clear, concise, and professional manner.",
