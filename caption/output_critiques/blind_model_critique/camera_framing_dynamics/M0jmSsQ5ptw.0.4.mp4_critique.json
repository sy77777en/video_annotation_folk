    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera initially focuses on a man playing golf, then gradually moves backward, occasionally panning left to reveal the entire scene.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic camera movement and perspective, it misses several key details that would provide a richer description of the shot. The description of the \"full scene\" is too generic; the dolly and pan actually reveal a stunning coastal golf course at sunset, with the ocean visible in the background and dramatic cliffs to the left, which is the main payoff of the shot. The caption also omits the crucial timing of the movement in relation to the subject's action: the camera holds steady on the man during his backswing, and the backward dolly and left pan begin the moment he makes contact with the ball, creating a sense of a motivated reveal that follows the ball's implied trajectory toward the ocean. Furthermore, the movement could be more precisely described as a slow, counter-clockwise arc rather than a simple dolly and pan, as the camera appears to pivot around the golfer. Finally, while the focus is generally deep, it's not uniformly so; the golfer is tack-sharp initially, and as the camera moves, the focus plane seems to expand to keep the mid-ground cliffs sharp, while the most distant waves have a slight, natural softness, creating a more moderate depth of field than \"deep focus\" implies.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a stunning coastal golf course at sunset, filmed from a smooth, eye-level perspective with a level angle. Initially, the camera holds steady on a man playing golf, focusing sharply on him during his backswing. As he makes contact with the ball, the camera begins a slow, counter-clockwise arc, pivoting around the golfer. This movement reveals the breathtaking scene: the ocean in the background and dramatic cliffs to the left. The focus plane expands to keep the mid-ground cliffs sharp, while the distant waves have a slight, natural softness, creating a moderate depth of field. The shot beautifully follows the ball's implied trajectory toward the ocean, offering a motivated reveal of the landscape.",
