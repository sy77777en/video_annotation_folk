    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field. The camera pans slowly from left to right, maintaining smooth and steady movement. The focus is on the group of people in the foreground as they move across the landscape.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the camera movement. While it correctly identifies several key attributes like camera height, angle, and focus, its misidentification of the primary movement as a \"pan\" instead of a \"truck\" or \"track\" is a critical error based on the provided instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"camera at eye level with a level angle\" is perfectly **accurate**. The perspective is from a standing height, looking straight ahead.\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"deep focus and a large depth of field\" is **accurate**. Both the subjects in the foreground/midground and the mountains in the background are in sharp focus.\n    *   **Steadiness & Speed:** \"pans slowly... maintaining smooth and steady movement\" is **accurate** in its description of the speed and stability. The movement is indeed slow and very steady, likely achieved with a gimbal or dolly.\n    *   **Subject of Focus:** \"The focus is on the group of people in the foreground\" is **accurate**.\n\n*   **What it gets wrong:**\n    *   **Camera Movement Type:** The most significant error is describing the movement as a **\"pan.\"**\n        *   A **pan** is a rotational movement where the camera pivots horizontally on a fixed axis (like turning your head).\n        *   This video shows a **trucking** (or **tracking**) shot, where the entire camera moves sideways, parallel to the subjects. The key evidence is the **parallax effect**: notice how the background mountains move much more slowly relative to the foreground subjects. This can only happen if the camera itself is changing its physical position, not just rotating. The caption should have used \"trucks\" or \"tracks.\"\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present (e.g., no mention of lens distortion, Dutch angle, or altered video speed, which is correct).\n*   It covers most of the required elements: height, angle, focus, and movement (type, speed, steadiness).\n*   It could be slightly more complete by explicitly stating the **purpose** of the movement, as suggested in the instructions. While \"as they move across the landscape\" implies it, using the term \"tracking\" would have been more direct (e.g., \"The camera tracks the group...\").\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption adheres well to the conciseness rule. However, \"deep focus and a large depth of field\" is slightly redundant, as they describe the same concept. Using just one term would be more concise.\n*   **Terminology:** The caption fails to use the correct terminology for the camera movement (\"pan\" vs. \"trucking/tracking\"), which is a core part of the instructions.\n*   **Structure:** The description is clear and logically structured.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies and better aligns with the instructions:\n\n**Shot at a level angle from eye-level, the video maintains a deep depth of field. The camera steadily tracks a group of people, trucking slowly from left to right to follow their movement across the landscape.**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n1.  **Corrects the Movement:** It accurately identifies the movement as **\"trucking\"** and **\"tracking,\"** which aligns with the visual evidence (parallax) and the instruction's terminology.\n2.  **More Concise:** It uses \"deep depth of field\" once, avoiding the redundancy of \"deep focus and a large depth of field.\"\n3.  **States the Purpose:** It explicitly states the camera's purpose (\"to follow their movement\"), fulfilling that part of the instruction.",
