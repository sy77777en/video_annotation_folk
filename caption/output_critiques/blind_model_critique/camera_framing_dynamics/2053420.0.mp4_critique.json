    "pre_caption": "The video is in fast-motion, with the camera positioned at hip level and angled straight ahead. It features deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward quickly along the road and trucks right as it changes lanes, maintaining smooth and steady motion.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A fast-motion video with forward playback speed slightly faster than real-time (1x–3x).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, representing the driver's view, moves forward along the road and trucks right as it changes lanes to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** \"The video is in fast-motion, with the camera positioned at hip level and angled straight ahead. It features deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward quickly along the road and trucks right as it changes lanes, maintaining smooth and steady motion.\"\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and captures several key aspects correctly, but it contains significant inaccuracies regarding camera position and movement direction.\n\n#### **1. Accuracy: Partially Accurate**\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** \"fast-motion\" is correct. The rapid movement and light streaks clearly indicate the video has been sped up.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is accurate. Everything from the dashboard in the foreground to the distant lights in the background is sharp.\n    *   **Movement Steadiness:** \"smooth and steady motion\" is correct. The movement is stable, as expected from a camera mounted in a car.\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"angled straight ahead\" is a reasonable description for what is technically a **level angle**.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"hip level\" is incorrect. The camera is positioned inside a car, likely on the dashboard or windshield, providing a driver's perspective. This is best described as **dashboard-level** or **eye-level from a seated position**. \"Hip level\" would imply a much lower viewpoint, as if someone were standing and holding the camera at their hip.\n    *   **Movement Direction:** \"trucks right\" is incorrect. The car moves from the right-most lane into the lane to its **left**. Therefore, the camera movement is a **truck left**.\n\n#### **2. Completeness: Mostly Complete**\n\nThe caption successfully covers most of the required elements relevant to this video:\n*   It correctly identifies the altered **video speed**.\n*   It describes the **camera angle**, **camera height** (though inaccurately), **focus**, and key **movements** (forward motion and trucking).\n*   It correctly omits descriptions of lens distortion and Dutch angles, as they are not present, adhering to the instruction for conciseness.\n\nThe description of the movement is slightly simplified but effective. It captures the primary forward dolly and the secondary trucking motion.\n\n#### **3. Adherence to the Instruction: Good**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon or descriptions of non-existent features, as instructed.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses technical terms like \"fast-motion,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"trucks.\" However, the factual errors in applying these terms (describing the wrong height and direction) detract from its overall quality.\n*   **Structure:** The caption is well-structured, first establishing the static configuration (speed, position, focus) and then describing the dynamic movement.\n\n### **Conclusion and Improved Caption**\n\nThe caption is not good because its factual inaccuracies about camera height and movement direction are misleading. While it follows the structure and includes the right categories of information, the errors make it an unreliable description of the video.\n\nHere is an improved caption that is accurate, complete, and adheres to all instructions:\n\n**Improved Caption:** The video is in **fast-motion**, captured from a **dashboard-level** position with a **level angle**. The shot maintains **deep focus**, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera moves forward steadily and quickly, then **trucks left** to change lanes.",
