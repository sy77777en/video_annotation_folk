    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The video begins with a forward motion for a few seconds, followed by a counterclockwise arc around the red vehicle that continues until the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, demonstrating a high degree of accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the specified format and terminology. It is both concise and packed with precise, relevant information.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate** in every detail.\n\n*   **\"unsteady, eye-level shot\"**: Correct. The camera is clearly handheld by someone walking, resulting in natural shakiness. The height is consistent with being held at a person's eye level.\n*   **\"maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: Correct. The foreground (grass), midground (the red vehicle), and background (trees) are all in relatively sharp focus, which is characteristic of a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"held at a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is pointed straight ahead, parallel to the ground, not tilted up (high angle) or down (low angle).\n*   **\"with a varying Dutch angle\"**: Correct. The horizon is consistently tilted, and the degree of tilt changes as the camera operator walks, creating a \"varying\" or swaying Dutch angle. This is a key and accurately observed detail.\n*   **\"initially moves forward\"**: Correct. The shot begins with the camera advancing toward the vehicle.\n*   **\"before beginning a counterclockwise arc around the rear of a red Land Rover Defender\"**: Correct. The camera movement transitions from a forward push to a circular path from the right side of the vehicle's rear to the left, which is a counterclockwise arc. The subject is also correctly identified.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **perfectly complete** according to the instructions, including all necessary information while correctly omitting what is not needed.\n\n*   **Included Elements**: It successfully covers steadiness, camera height, focus/depth of field, camera angle, Dutch angle, and the type, direction, and complexity of the camera movement.\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly)**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions needed to be described.\n\nBy including only the relevant, non-standard attributes of the shot, the caption remains concise and impactful.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates **flawless adherence** to the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical information into a single, well-structured sentence without feeling cluttered.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It correctly uses specific terms like \"deep focus,\" \"level angle,\" \"Dutch angle,\" and \"counterclockwise arc.\"\n*   **Describing Movement**: It describes the camera's multiple movements in the correct temporal order (\"initially moves forward before beginning...\").\n*   **Clarity**: The description is easy to understand and allows the reader to perfectly visualize the shot's technical execution without even seeing the video.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary response to the prompt. It is accurate, thorough, and follows all formatting and content rules precisely. It successfully translates a complex visual sequence into a clear and technically sound description.",
