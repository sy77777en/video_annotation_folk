    "pre_caption": "This video is filmed from a slightly unsteady, first-person point of view, showing a parachute landing. It features noticeable fisheye distortion, which curves straight lines. The camera begins at an aerial height with a bird's-eye view, descending to an overhead, high-angle perspective. During the descent, the camera briefly rolls counterclockwise and tilts up just before landing. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an aerial level and then moves to an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a first-person POV of someone on a parachute landing on the ground. During the descent, it briefly rolls counterclockwise as the person adjusts their posture, and at the end, it tilts up just before touching the ground. The overall movement is quite shaky, as if filmed without a stabilizer.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the first-person perspective and fisheye distortion, it oversimplifies the camera's complex movements and mischaracterizes some angles. The initial shot is less of a true bird's-eye view and more of a high-angle perspective looking forward, which gradually transitions to a level angle relative to the horizon just before landing. The description misses the constant, gentle forward dolly motion as the parachute is carried by the wind. The \"brief roll and tilt up\" is actually part of a more complex sequence: the camera first pans left, then rolls slightly as the head turns, tilts up to check the canopy, and crucially, tilts back down to focus on the ground for the landing—a key action that is omitted. Furthermore, the video isn't entirely at a regular speed; it incorporates a brief slow-motion effect the moment the feet touch the ground to emphasize the impact, before a final, jarring shake as the parachutist rolls. The camera's final position is a worm's-eye view from the ground, looking up at the sky and the collapsing parachute. Lastly, while the focus is generally deep, it's not uniform; the focus plane is sharpest on the midground elements like the skydiver's hands and GPS altimeter, with the distant background being noticeably softer, a nuance lost in the \"deep focus\" description.",
