    "pre_caption": "This video is filmed from a slightly unsteady, first-person point of view, showing a parachute landing. It features noticeable fisheye distortion, which curves straight lines. The camera begins at an aerial height with a bird's-eye view, descending to an overhead, high-angle perspective. During the descent, the camera briefly rolls counterclockwise and tilts up just before landing. A deep focus is maintained throughout, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an aerial level and then moves to an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a first-person POV of someone on a parachute landing on the ground. During the descent, it briefly rolls counterclockwise as the person adjusts their posture, and at the end, it tilts up just before touching the ground. The overall movement is quite shaky, as if filmed without a stabilizer.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written caption that successfully follows most of the complex instructions. It is accurate, informative, and uses the correct terminology.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **First-person POV & Steadiness:** \"Slightly unsteady, first-person point of view\" is a perfect description. The camera is body-mounted, leading to natural, minor instability.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** \"Noticeable fisheye distortion\" is accurate. The wide-angle lens creates a distinct curvature, especially visible on the horizon and with the parachute lines.\n*   **Height & Angle:** The description of the starting position (\"aerial height with a bird's-eye view\") and the transition (\"descending to an overhead, high-angle perspective\") is correct.\n*   **Movement:** The identification of a \"roll\" and a \"tilt up\" is accurate. The parachutist does roll to steer and looks up/forward toward the horizon before landing.\n*   **Focus:** \"Deep focus is maintained throughout\" is spot on. Due to the wide-angle lens and bright daylight, everything from the parachute lines in the foreground to the ground in the background is sharp.\n\n**Completeness: Very Good**\n\nThe caption covers почти all the key aspects required by the instructions. However, it could be slightly more complete in two areas:\n\n1.  **Final Position:** The caption describes the descent to an \"overhead, high-angle perspective\" but stops there. It doesn't mention the final part of the movement, where the camera reaches **ground-level/eye-level** with a **level angle** upon landing.\n2.  **Movement Complexity:** While it correctly identifies a roll and a tilt, it could also mention the subtle **panning** movements as the person looks left and right while descending. The primary movement is the **descent** (a form of vertical craning/pedestaling), which is implied but could be stated more explicitly as the main camera motion.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary information. It correctly omits mentions of video speed (as it's normal), Dutch angle (as there is none), and focus changes (as it's fixed).\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly and effectively (e.g., *fisheye distortion, bird's-eye view, high-angle, roll, tilt, deep focus*).\n*   **Structure:** The description flows logically from the overall setup to specific details like distortion, movement, and focus.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is very good and fulfills the request to a high standard. The feedback above is minor and intended to elevate it from \"very good\" to \"perfect.\" The core description is accurate and well-formulated.\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the minor points of feedback for enhanced completeness:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"Filmed from a slightly unsteady, first-person point of view, this single-shot video of a parachute landing features noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera's primary movement is a continuous descent, starting from an **aerial height with a bird's-eye view** and ending at **eye-level with a level angle** upon landing. During the descent, the camera subtly pans and rolls as the person steers, and tilts up just before touching down. A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp throughout.\"\n\n**Why the revision is an improvement:**\n\n*   **Complete Trajectory:** It now describes the full range of motion, from the starting aerial height to the final eye-level landing.\n*   **Movement Hierarchy:** It clarifies that the \"continuous descent\" is the primary movement, with pans, rolls, and tilts being secondary actions.\n*   **More Detail:** It adds \"panning\" to create a more comprehensive picture of the camera's movement.\n*   **Flow:** It integrates the movements into a single, more fluid sentence.",
