    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the camera movement and misses some key details required by the instructions. While it correctly identifies the angle and depth of field, its description of the camera's action is fundamentally incorrect, and it lacks the specificity requested for a comprehensive analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"camera positioned at eye level\" - Partially Incorrect.** The camera is not at the subject's eye level; it's significantly lower, looking up. A more accurate description would be **chest-level** or **hip-level**. \"Eye-level\" typically implies a neutral shot where the camera is at the same height as the subject's eyes, looking straight.\n*   **\"with a low angle, looking up\" - Accurate.** This correctly describes the camera's upward tilt toward the subject.\n*   **\"It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man in the foreground\" - Accurate.** The subject is in sharp focus, while the background is heavily blurred, which perfectly defines a shallow depth of field with the focus plane on the foreground.\n*   **\"zooming in\" - Incorrect.** This is the most critical error. The camera is not zooming; it is **dollying in**. A zoom involves changing the lens's focal length, which magnifies the image but doesn't change the spatial relationship (parallax) between the foreground and background. In the video, you can clearly see the background elements (pipes, lights) shifting and moving past the subject's silhouette as the camera moves forward. This parallax effect is the definitive sign of a physical camera movement through space (a dolly).\n*   **\"with slight shakiness\" - Accurate.** The movement is not perfectly smooth, indicating it might be handheld or on a shoulder rig rather than a perfectly stable dolly track.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is not complete according to the detailed instructions. It missed the following points:\n\n*   **Type of Movement:** It misidentified the movement as a \"zoom\" instead of a **dolly in**. The instructions specifically ask for terms like *dollying*, *trucking*, *panning*, etc.\n*   **Secondary Movement:** The camera also performs a subtle **tilt up** as it moves forward to keep the man's head and shoulders properly framed. This was not mentioned.\n*   **Focus Changes:** The instructions ask to note dynamic focus changes like *focus tracking*. As the camera dollies closer to the man, the focus puller must adjust the focus to keep him sharp. Therefore, the camera is performing **focus tracking** on the subject, which is a crucial detail that was omitted.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The slow dolly-in serves a clear purpose: to gradually increase intimacy with the character, build tension, and draw the viewer's full attention to his expression and reaction. This \"why\" is missing.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instruction\n\nThe caption follows the instruction to be concise and correctly omits unnecessary information (like normal video speed and lack of lens distortion). However, it fails to adhere to the core requirement of providing a **\"concise yet informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration\"** because it neglects to use the specific, accurate terminology for movement and focus that the instructions explicitly list (e.g., *dollying*, *tilting*, *focus tracking*).\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"From a chest-level height and a low angle, the camera slowly dollies forward toward the man, tilting up slightly to maintain framing. The shot has a slight, organic shakiness. A shallow depth of field keeps the man in the foreground sharp against a heavily blurred background, and the focus actively tracks him as the camera moves closer.\"**",
