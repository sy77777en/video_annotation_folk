    "pre_caption": "This eye-level shot begins with a high-angle view focused on a picture on a table. The camera then executes a smooth, continuous backward and upward movement, tilting up to transition from the high-angle close-up to a level-angle full shot of the train compartment. The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire room sharp throughout the movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward and slightly upward with continuously tilt-up motion, shifting focus from a close-up of a picture on the table in a high-angle view to a full shot of the whole room in a level-angle view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the deep focus and the general camera path, it could be refined for greater accuracy and detail. The opening, \"This eye-level shot begins with a high-angle view,\" is contradictory; it would be clearer to state that the shot *begins* with a high-angle (or perhaps a more specific \"bird's-eye\") view of the picture and *concludes* at a level angle. The description of the movement as \"backward and upward... tilting up\" is accurate but could be more concisely described as a single, fluid \"crane shot\" or \"jib shot,\" which better captures the professional quality of the motion. The caption also omits that the video appears to be at a normal playback speed, as evidenced by the scenery moving past the train window. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to note the absence of lens distortion in the final wide shot, as this implies a high-quality, corrected lens was used. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is correct, you could strengthen this by specifying that both the foreground picture and the distant end of the train compartment remain perfectly sharp throughout the entire crane movement, emphasizing the impressive depth of field.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The shot begins with a bird's-eye view focused on a picture on a table and transitions into a fluid crane shot that moves backward and upward, concluding at a level-angle full shot of the train compartment. The deep focus ensures that both the foreground picture and the distant end of the compartment remain perfectly sharp throughout the movement. The video plays at normal speed, as indicated by the scenery moving past the train window, and the absence of lens distortion in the final wide shot suggests the use of a high-quality, corrected lens.",
