    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is at an aerial level, initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone smoothly moves forward over a cityscape at dusk, finishing with a slight upward tilt.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone captures the dusk scene of a city, continuously moving forward and finishing with a slight upward tilt.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-structured and detailed request. Here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, uses the correct terminology, and successfully captures the most important technical aspects of the video in a concise manner. It adheres well to the instructions, but there is minor room for improvement in structure and precision.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions:\n\n*   **\"noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward\"**: **Correct.** The video clearly exhibits strong fisheye distortion, which is most apparent in the curved horizon and the bowed buildings at the edges of the frame.\n*   **\"camera is at an aerial level\"**: **Correct.** The shot is taken from a drone high above the city.\n*   **\"initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle\"**: **Mostly Correct, but could be more precise.** It starts at a level angle, looking forward. The camera then tilts up, which results in a low-angle perspective *relative to the sky and the tops of the buildings*. Describing the *movement* (\"tilts upward\") is slightly more precise than describing the resulting angle, but the caption does mention this movement later.\n*   **\"maintains deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: **Correct.** Everything from the foreground buildings to the distant horizon is sharp and in focus.\n*   **\"drone smoothly moves forward over a cityscape at dusk\"**: **Correct.** The movement is a smooth forward dolly/tracking shot, and the lighting indicates dusk.\n*   **\"finishing with a slight upward tilt\"**: **Correct.** This accurately describes the final camera rotation and is a more precise description of the action that causes the \"shift to a low angle.\"\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption covers most of the required elements from the instructions:\n\n*   **Covered:** Lens Distortion, Camera Height, Camera Angle, Focus/Depth of Field, and Camera Movement (translation, rotation, steadiness).\n*   **Not Covered (and correctly so):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so omitting this follows the instruction to be concise.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** There is no Dutch angle, so it is correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n*   **Minor Omission:**\n    *   **Movement Speed:** The caption mentions the movement is \"smoothly\" done but doesn't explicitly state the speed (e.g., \"moderate speed\"). This is a very minor point, as the speed is constant and not a defining feature of the shot.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the spirit and letter of the instructions:\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses terms like `fisheye distortion`, `aerial level`, `level angle`, `deep focus`, and `upward tilt`.\n*   **Structure:** The main point of critique is a slight redundancy. The caption describes the angle change twice: first as a state change (\"shifts to a low angle\") and then as a movement (\"finishing with a slight upward tilt\"). Combining these would make the description more efficient.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo make the caption even better, we can refine the structure to eliminate the minor redundancy and improve the flow.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is at an aerial level, initially at a level angle, then shifts to a low angle. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone smoothly moves forward over a cityscape at dusk, finishing with a slight upward tilt.\n\n**Improved Version:**\n> With noticeable fisheye distortion, the aerial-level camera smoothly moves forward over a cityscape at dusk. Starting from a level angle, the shot concludes with a slight upward tilt, maintaining deep focus throughout.\n\n**Why this version is an improvement:**\n*   **More Concise:** It integrates the description of the angle change directly into the flow of movement, removing the redundancy.\n*   **Better Flow:** It describes the shot chronologically: camera setup (distortion, height) -> primary movement (forward) -> final movement (tilt) -> constant state (focus).\n*   **Maintains all key information** while being slightly shorter and more elegant.",
