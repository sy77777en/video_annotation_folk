    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is rolling counterclockwise and zooming out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great example to analyze. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **accurate** in describing the primary camera movements but is **incomplete** and does not fully adhere to the detailed instructions provided. It correctly identifies the most noticeable actions (rolling and zooming) but omits several key configurational details that were explicitly requested.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:** The caption is perfectly accurate in its description of the camera's movement.\n    *   **\"slowly and smoothly\"**: Correct. The movement is steady and unhurried, with no shaking or jitter.\n    *   **\"rolls counterclockwise\"**: Correct. The frame rotates around the lens axis, with the top of the frame moving to the left.\n    *   **\"zooming out\"**: Correct. The field of view widens, making the subjects appear smaller and further away. This could also be a dolly-out, but \"zooming out\" is a visually accurate description of the effect.\n\n*   **What it gets wrong:**\n    *   The caption includes a description of the subjects (\"two stressed-looking men\"). While this is true, the instructions specifically ask for a description of the **camera's configuration**, not the content or the emotional state of the subjects. This part of the caption does not adhere to the prompt.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's missing:** The caption is missing several key descriptive elements required by the instructions.\n    *   **Camera Angle and Height:** It fails to mention that the shot is filmed from an **eye-level height** and maintains a **level angle** relative to the subjects (even as the frame itself rolls).\n    *   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the two men in the **midground** in sharp focus while the background is heavily blurred. The focus remains fixed on the subjects throughout the shot.\n    *   **Lens Distortion / Video Speed / Dutch Angle:** The caption correctly omits any mention of lens distortion or altered video speed, as neither is present. The \"roll\" is a more precise way to describe the action that creates a continuously changing **Dutch angle**, so its description is superior to just stating \"Dutch angle.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption succeeds in being **concise**, but it does so at the expense of being **informative** according to the specific rules.\n*   It fails to provide a comprehensive description of the camera's configuration, focusing only on movement.\n*   It incorrectly includes a description of the video's content (the men's appearance) instead of sticking strictly to technical specifications.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more closely follows your instructions:\n\n**\"From an eye-level, level angle, the camera slowly and smoothly rolls counterclockwise while simultaneously zooming out. A shallow depth of field keeps the midground subjects in focus against a blurred background.\"**\n\n### Why This Version is Better:\n\n*   **Comprehensive:** It includes all the required elements present in the video: movement (roll, zoom), speed (slowly, smoothly), height (eye-level), angle (level), and focus (shallow depth of field, midground focus plane).\n*   **Adherent:** It focuses strictly on the **camera and video configuration** without describing the subjects' emotional state.\n*   **Precise:** It uses specific terminology like \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"shallow depth of field\" as requested.\n*   **Concise:** It remains clear and to the point, conveying all the necessary information without unnecessary words.",
