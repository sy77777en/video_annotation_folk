    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts by focusing on the top of the mountain slightly high angle. It remains static for a while before craning up around the avatar reveal more of the scenery.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** and effectively captures the most prominent aspects of the camera work—its movement and initial framing. It is accurate, concise, and uses appropriate terminology. However, it is incomplete as it omits a key detail required by the instructions: the camera's focus and depth of field.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in the details it chooses to describe:\n*   **\"This shot begins with a static, slightly high-angle view...\"**: This is correct. The video starts with a stationary camera positioned slightly above the character, looking down.\n*   **\"...focused on the character on the mountaintop.\"**: Correct. The character is the initial subject and point of interest.\n*   **\"The camera then smoothly cranes upward...\"**: This accurately describes the vertical, ascending motion. \"Crane\" is the perfect term for this large-scale vertical movement. \"Smoothly\" correctly describes the steadiness.\n*   **\"...circling around the character...\"**: This is a good, user-friendly way to describe the arcing motion. The camera does indeed circle (or arc) around the subject.\n*   **\"...to reveal more of the surrounding aurora-filled sky.\"**: This correctly identifies the purpose and result of the camera movement, which is a key part of the instructions.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThis is the main area for improvement. The caption successfully omits unnecessary information (regular video speed, no lens distortion) as instructed, but it also misses one required element.\n\n*   **Included:**\n    *   **Initial State:** Static\n    *   **Camera Angle:** High-angle\n    *   **Movement:** Craning, circling (arcing)\n    *   **Steadiness:** Smoothly\n    *   **Purpose:** To reveal the sky\n\n*   **Omitted:**\n    *   **Focus / Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The shot uses a **deep depth of field**, where the character in the midground, the mountains in the background, and the sky are all in sharp focus. This is a crucial stylistic choice that contributes to the epic, grand scale of the scene. The instructions specifically ask for this to be described.\n    *   **Movement Direction (Minor Detail):** While \"circling\" is good, a more precise description would be \"arcing counter-clockwise.\" This is a minor point, and \"circling\" is an acceptable simplification for conciseness.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise and well-written, avoiding jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"circling\" instead of \"arcing\").\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses technical terms like \"static,\" \"high-angle,\" and \"cranes.\"\n*   **Structure:** It follows a logical temporal order, describing the initial static shot before detailing the movement.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** It successfully includes the purpose of the camera movement, which is a specific requirement.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the missing information about focus while maintaining conciseness, making it fully compliant with the instructions.\n\n**\"With a deep focus keeping the entire landscape sharp, this shot begins with a static, high-angle view of the character. The camera then smoothly cranes upward while arcing around them to reveal the vast, aurora-filled sky.\"**",
