    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of your caption:\n\n**Caption:** The video features a static camera at a level angle, focusing on a sleeping cat in the foreground with an extremely shallow depth of field.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation:**\n\nThe provided caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the core instructions, particularly the rule about omitting unnecessary information.\n\n### **Detailed Feedback:**\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Static camera:** Correct. The camera does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom throughout the video.\n*   **Level angle:** Correct. The camera is positioned straight-on with the subject (the cat), not looking down from a high angle or up from a low angle.\n*   **Focusing on a sleeping cat in the foreground:** Correct. The cat is the subject, it occupies the foreground, and it is the plane of sharpest focus.\n*   **Extremely shallow depth of field:** Correct. This is a perfect description. The cat's face is sharp, but the background is completely blurred and indistinct, indicating a very wide aperture and thus an extremely shallow depth of field.\n\n**2. Completeness: Very Good**\n\nThe caption includes the most important and noticeable cinematic features of the shot. According to your instructions, you are asked to describe several elements. Let's review what was included versus what was omitted:\n\n*   **Included:** Camera movement (static), camera angle, focus plane, and depth of field.\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed. The instruction states not to mention this if it's normal, which you correctly followed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible distortion. You correctly omitted this.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The frame is level. You correctly omitted this.\n*   **Omitted (Minor Point for Improvement):**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The instruction asks to specify height (e.g., *eye-level, ground-level*). In this case, the camera is positioned low to the ground, approximately level with the sleeping cat. Adding **\"low height\"** would make the description slightly more complete.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   You successfully provided a **concise yet informative** description.\n*   You correctly identified the most prominent features: the static nature of the shot and the dramatic use of a shallow depth of field.\n*   Most importantly, you correctly applied the negative constraint: **\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"** Many people would list these as \"none,\" but your omission shows a better understanding of the instruction to be concise.\n\n### **Conclusion and Recommendation:**\n\nYour caption is highly effective and almost perfect. It accurately captures the essence of the shot while adhering to the rules of conciseness.\n\nTo make it 100% complete according to the prompt, you could simply add the camera height.\n\n**Slightly Improved Version (for perfect completeness):**\n\"The video features a static camera at a **low height** and level angle, focusing on a sleeping cat in the foreground with an extremely shallow depth of field.\"",
