    "pre_caption": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level. Initially, the camera angle is high, looking down, but it transitions to a level angle as the camera moves. The shot maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. This is a first-person POV shot where the camera moves forward, concluding with a slight upward tilt. The camera movement is unsteady, with noticeable shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** This is a first-person POV shot. The camera moves forward with a slight upward tilt at the end.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This caption provides a solid foundation, but it misses some of the nuance and interconnectedness of the camera's actions. The description separates the angle change from the forward movement, whereas in the video, the transition from a high angle (looking down at steps) to a level angle is a direct and natural result of the subject descending a staircase and then walking onto a flat path. The term \"moves forward\" is too generic; it would be more accurate to describe it as a forward dolly at a walking pace, which also accounts for the \"unsteady, with noticeable shaking\" that is clearly the rhythmic, vertical bob of a person's gait. Furthermore, the \"mild barrel distortion\" is most apparent in the slight bowing of the brick walls lining the alleyway, a detail that adds context. Finally, the concluding \"slight upward tilt\" isn't random; it's a purposeful action as the subject's gaze lifts to frame the large clock tower at the end of the path, which serves as the shot's final point of interest.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a first-person POV shot with mild barrel distortion, most noticeable in the slight bowing of the brick walls lining the alleyway. The camera starts at a high angle, looking down at steps, and transitions naturally to a level angle as the subject descends a staircase and walks onto a flat path. This movement is a forward dolly at a walking pace, characterized by the rhythmic, vertical bob of a person's gait, resulting in unsteady, noticeable shaking.
