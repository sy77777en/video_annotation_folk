    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is **excellent**. It is a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions, resulting in a description that is accurate, complete, and concise.\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is 100% accurate.\n    *   **Camera Position:** It correctly identifies the **eye-level** height and **level angle**. The camera is not looking up or down at the subjects but straight on.\n    *   **Focus:** It accurately describes the **shallow depth of field**, correctly noting that the **midground** (the buffalo) is in focus while the foreground and background are blurred.\n    *   **Movement:** It correctly states that the camera is **completely static**.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The caption is perfectly complete according to the rules. It addresses all the relevant, observable aspects of the video's configuration. It successfully identifies and describes the key features (height, angle, focus, and movement) without missing any important details.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption demonstrates a masterful adherence to the instructions.\n    *   **Conciseness:** It follows the rule to omit default settings. There is no mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle because the video is at regular speed, has no distortion, and the horizon is level. This makes the description efficient and to the point.\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions, such as \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground,\" and \"static.\"\n    *   **Structure:** The description is well-structured, logically presenting the camera's position, then its focus, and finally its movement (or lack thereof).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is exceptionally good. It is a model response that perfectly balances detail with conciseness, demonstrating a clear understanding of both the video's technical aspects and the specific requirements of the captioning instructions. No improvements are needed.",
