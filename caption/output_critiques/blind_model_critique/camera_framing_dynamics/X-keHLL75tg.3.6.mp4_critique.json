    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera pans slightly left and zooms in to highlight a man talking in the background.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption provides a good baseline, it lacks the specificity needed to accurately represent a dynamic shot. Describing the movement as both \"smooth\" and \"handheld\" is contradictory; if the shot is perfectly stable, it's likely on a gimbal, whereas if it has a natural sway, \"smooth\" is an overstatement. The description of the movement as a \"pan left\" might be inaccurate; the camera could be \"trucking left\" (moving sideways), which would create a more pronounced parallax effect between the woman in the foreground and the man in the midground. Furthermore, the focus description is too simplistic. Instead of just \"maintaining\" a shallow focus, the shot could execute a subtle \"rack focus\" from the woman's out-of-focus shoulder to the man as the camera zooms, actively directing the viewer's attention. The terms \"somewhat out of focus\" and \"relatively clear\" are vague; it would be more descriptive to state that the foreground is \"heavily blurred\" while the man is \"kept in sharp focus.\" The caption also completely omits the state of the background, which, in a shallow focus shot, is likely blurred into a soft bokeh, a key visual element. Finally, as the camera zooms in, it likely performs a slight \"tilt down\" to maintain the man's head-and-shoulders framing, a movement not mentioned in the current description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera, likely stabilized on a gimbal, smoothly trucks left, creating a dynamic parallax effect between the heavily blurred woman in the foreground and the sharply focused man in the midground. As the camera zooms in, it subtly tilts down to maintain a head-and-shoulders framing of the man, while executing a gentle rack focus from the woman's out-of-focus shoulder to the man, guiding the viewer's attention. The background is softly blurred into a bokeh, enhancing the depth of the scene.",
