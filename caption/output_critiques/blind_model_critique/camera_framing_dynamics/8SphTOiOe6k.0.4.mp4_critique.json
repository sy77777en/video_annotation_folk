    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera continuously moves forward along the side of the street, initially panning right moderately to align with its direction of motion.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic handheld nature, eye-level perspective, and the primary camera movements, it misses several key visual details and oversimplifies others. The description of the movement as \"panning to the right and moving forward\" is functionally correct, but in the video, this combined action feels more like an *arc* as the camera's path curves slightly while the operator's focus shifts. The term \"slightly unsteady\" is too generic; the video exhibits a distinct, rhythmic vertical bobbing motion consistent with a walking gait, not random shakiness. Furthermore, the caption omits a crucial third movement: after the pan stops, the camera performs a slow *tilt upward* to reframe the shot from the street level to the upper floors of the buildings ahead. The assertion of \"deep focus\" is also an exaggeration; while the depth of field is wide, the focus is clearly set on the midground architecture across the street, leaving the closest foreground elements (like a passing pedestrian's shoulder) and the distant skyline slightly soft. Finally, the caption fails to mention the subtle but evident *barrel distortion*, where vertical lines of buildings near the frame's edges bow outwards, indicating the use of a wide-angle lens that significantly shapes the scene's geometry.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a handheld shot from an eye-level perspective, capturing a street scene with a rhythmic vertical bobbing motion typical of a walking gait. The camera follows an arc-like path, curving slightly as it pans to the right and moves forward along the street. After the pan, the camera tilts upward, shifting the focus from street level to the upper floors of the buildings. The depth of field is wide, with the midground architecture in sharp focus, while the foreground and distant skyline are slightly soft. Notably, the wide-angle lens introduces subtle barrel distortion, causing vertical lines near the frame's edges to bow outward.",
