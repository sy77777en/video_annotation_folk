    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, utilizing deep focus for a large depth of field. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, complete, and adheres very well to the provided instructions.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"eye level with a level angle\" is a precise and accurate description for a standard, straightforward shot.\n*   **Focus:** \"utilizing deep focus for a large depth of field\" correctly describes a scenario where both foreground and background elements are sharp. The phrasing is clear and informative.\n*   **Movement & Steadiness:** \"The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\" is a particularly strong and nuanced description. It correctly identifies the camera as being in a fixed position (not panning, tilting, or dollying) while also capturing the subtle reality of a handheld or non-stabilized shot (\"slightly unsteady\"). This is more descriptive and accurate than simply stating \"the camera is static.\"\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects present in a simple, static shot: height, angle, focus, and steadiness.\n*   Crucially, it correctly follows the instruction to omit details for default settings. By not mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or a Dutch angle, it implies these are all standard/absent, which makes the caption concise and efficient.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise, packing all the necessary information into two clear sentences without any filler.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus\").\n*   **Movement Description:** It perfectly balances the instruction to \"simply state that the shot is static\" with the instruction to \"indicate the degree\" of shaking. The phrase \"fixed but slightly unsteady\" is an ideal synthesis of these two points, providing more information than just \"static\" without being overly wordy.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis is a model caption that demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions. It is descriptive, technically precise, and efficiently communicates the key visual characteristics of the shot. There are no significant areas for improvement.",
