    "pre_caption": "This is a stop-motion video shot from a bird's-eye view. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera is initially static, capturing the clothes folding themselves, and then performs a quick, smooth truck to the right at the very end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts with a static top-down view of clothes on the ground, then ends with a quick, slight truck to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the video as **stop-motion**, which is evident from the jerky, frame-by-frame movement of the clothes.\n*   **Camera Angle:** It accurately describes the angle as a **bird's-eye view**, as the camera is positioned directly overhead, looking straight down.\n*   **Focus:** The description of **deep focus** is correct. The entire scene, including the clothes and the surrounding floorboards, remains sharp and clear throughout the video.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The caption correctly breaks down the camera's action into two phases: it is **initially static** while the clothes are folding, and then it performs a **quick, smooth truck to the right** at the end. This is a precise description of the movement that occurs.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids mentioning features that are not present, such as lens distortion or a Dutch angle, as instructed.\n*   **Required Elements:** It successfully covers all the relevant points from the instructions:\n    *   **Video Speed:** \"stop-motion\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"bird's-eye view\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus\"\n    *   **Movement:** It clearly distinguishes between the \"static\" portion and the final \"quick, smooth truck to the right,\" describing the type, direction, speed, and steadiness of the movement.\n*   **Terminology:** The caption uses the precise technical terms (\"stop-motion,\" \"bird's-eye view,\" \"deep focus,\" \"static,\" \"truck\") as requested by the instructions.\n*   **Structure:** The description of the camera's behavior is presented in the correct temporal order (static first, then movement), making it easy to follow.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It provides a comprehensive and technically accurate description of the video's configuration in a clear and concise manner.",
