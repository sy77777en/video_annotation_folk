    "pre_caption": "This is a stop-motion video shot from a bird's-eye view. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera is initially static, capturing the clothes folding themselves, and then performs a quick, smooth truck to the right at the very end.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A stop-motion video using frame-by-frame changes to simulate motion.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts with a static top-down view of clothes on the ground, then ends with a quick, slight truck to the right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the stop-motion technique and the bird's-eye angle, it could be more precise and descriptive. The \"bird's-eye view\" is more specifically an `overhead-level` shot, as the camera seems fixed just a few feet above the floor where the clothes are animated. The description of \"deep focus\" is generally accurate, but there appears to be a very subtle `barrel distortion`, causing the floorboards at the extreme edges of the frame to curve slightly outward, which is common with wide lenses used for this type of overhead shot. The main point of improvement lies in the description of the camera movement. While it is a \"quick, smooth truck to the right,\" the movement also has a slight `pedestal up` component, causing the camera to rise slightly as it moves sideways. This combined `truck-and-pedestal` motion serves a specific purpose not mentioned in the caption: it gracefully moves from the now-neatly folded stack of clothes to frame an empty laundry basket, creating a sense of completion and tidiness. Adding details about the subtle lens distortion, the compound nature of the final camera movement, and its narrative purpose would provide a much richer and more accurate description.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This stop-motion video features an overhead-level shot, with the camera positioned just a few feet above the floor where the clothes are animated. The scene maintains a deep focus, though there is a subtle barrel distortion at the edges, typical of wide lenses used for such shots. Initially, the camera is static, capturing the clothes folding themselves. At the end, it performs a quick, smooth truck to the right with a slight pedestal up, transitioning from the neatly folded stack of clothes to an empty laundry basket. This combined truck-and-pedestal motion enhances the narrative by creating a sense of completion and tidiness.",
