    "pre_caption": "This is a static, hip-level shot filmed with a level angle. The video features a speed ramp effect, shifting between fast and slow motion. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the chainsaw in the foreground in sharp focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the hip-level, level-angle shot and the use of a speed ramp and shallow depth of field, it lacks specificity and may overlook key details. The description of the shot as \"static\" could be an oversimplification; in a video featuring a powerful tool like a chainsaw, it's plausible there would be minimal, high-frequency camera shake from ground vibrations, which would be more accurate to note. The caption also misses an opportunity to describe the *purpose* of the speed ramp; for instance, the video might use fast-motion for the initial, rough cuts on a log and then transition to dramatic slow-motion to highlight the precision of a final cut, sending wood chips flying poetically. Furthermore, the description of the focus is too basic. Instead of just \"keeping the chainsaw in the foreground in sharp focus,\" it could be more precise by mentioning that the focus actively *tracks* the chainsaw blade as it moves slightly forward and back, while the artist in the midground and the workshop in the background remain softly blurred. Finally, a shot this close to the action might have been filmed with a wider lens, potentially introducing a subtle *barrel distortion* that bows straight lines near the edges of the frame, an important optical characteristic that is currently omitted.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video features a hip-level, level-angle shot with a dynamic quality, capturing minimal, high-frequency camera shake from ground vibrations as the chainsaw operates. A speed ramp effect is used strategically: fast-motion highlights the initial rough cuts on a log, while dramatic slow-motion emphasizes the precision of a final cut, sending wood chips flying poetically. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, with the focus actively tracking the chainsaw blade as it moves slightly forward and back, keeping it in sharp focus while the artist in the midground and the workshop in the background remain softly blurred. Filmed with a wider lens, the shot introduces subtle barrel distortion, gently bowing straight lines near the edges of the frame, adding to the immersive experience.",
