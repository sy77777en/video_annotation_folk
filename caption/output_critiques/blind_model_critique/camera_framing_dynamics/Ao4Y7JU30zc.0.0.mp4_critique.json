    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a person sitting in a dark room, steadily trucking left while panning right to keep them centered.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is highly accurate, comprehensive in its relevant details, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions, especially regarding conciseness.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe description is exceptionally accurate in every detail:\n*   **Camera Position:** `\"From a low, ground-level position...\"` is perfect. The camera is indeed very close to the floor (**ground-level** height) and angled slightly upward at the subject (**low** angle).\n*   **Camera Movement:** `\"...trucks left while panning right...\"` is a precise and sophisticated observation. The camera physically moves sideways to the left (trucking) while simultaneously rotating right on its axis (panning) to counteract the movement and keep the subject centered. This is exactly what is happening in the video.\n*   **Steadiness:** `\"...slightly unsteady camera...\"` correctly identifies the subtle, natural shake, suggesting it's likely a handheld or gimbal shot rather than a perfectly smooth dolly on a track.\n*   **Framing and Subject:** `\"...keeping a silhouetted person sitting on a bench centered in the frame.\"` This accurately describes the subject, their visual appearance (silhouette), and the purpose of the camera's pan.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** `\"...deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping the entire dark room relatively sharp.\"` This is spot on. Both the subject in the midground and the architectural details in the background are in clear focus, which defines a large depth of field.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present:\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes camera height, angle, movement (translation, rotation, steadiness, purpose), and focus.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no significant distortion, so it is correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so there is no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there is no mention of rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions are described.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions perfectly:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a large amount of technical information into two clear, well-structured sentences without any wasted words.\n*   **Technical Terminology:** It uses the correct professional terms (`trucks`, `panning`, `deep focus`, `depth of field`) as requested.\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the combined `trucking left` and `panning right` movement is a hallmark of a high-quality analysis, as it explains *how* the camera achieves its smooth, subject-focused parallax effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is exemplary. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography and an ability to articulate complex camera configurations and movements with precision and brevity, fully satisfying all requirements of the prompt. It is difficult to improve upon.",
