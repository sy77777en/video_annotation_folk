    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the backward movement, upward tilt, and shallow depth of field, it contains a contradiction and misses several key details that would likely be present in such a cinematic shot. The description of \"tilting upward while maintaining a level-angle perspective\" is impossible; a tilt upward inherently changes the perspective to a low angle. A more accurate description would be: \"The camera starts at a level angle and tilts slightly upward, transitioning into a low angle that emphasizes the woman against the towering neon signs.\" The phrase \"leads a woman\" is also imprecise; \"tracking backward\" or \"dollying out\" are more standard terms. Furthermore, the caption omits the video's speed; a shot like this is often filmed in slow-motion to create a more dramatic or dreamlike effect, which would be a critical detail. There is also no mention of potential lens characteristics, such as the subtle barrel distortion common with wide-angle lenses used for tracking shots, or the specific framing of the subject (e.g., is she centered, or placed on a third?). Finally, the description of focus could be more specific by noting if it's achieved via \"autofocus tracking\" that keeps her face sharp as she moves, which would be a more technical and informative detail than simply stating she is \"in sharp focus.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The camera starts at a level angle and tilts slightly upward, transitioning into a low angle that emphasizes the woman against the towering neon signs. It tracks backward with a smooth dolly-out motion, maintaining a shallow depth of field that keeps her face in sharp focus through autofocus tracking, while the neon-lit background remains beautifully blurred. The shot is captured in slow-motion, adding a dramatic, dreamlike quality. The woman is framed slightly off-center, enhancing the dynamic composition, and the use of a wide-angle lens introduces subtle barrel distortion, enriching the cinematic effect.",
