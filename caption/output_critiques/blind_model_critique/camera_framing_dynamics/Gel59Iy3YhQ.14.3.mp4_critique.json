    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures a game scene from a high angle, gently moving left and right to evoke a peaceful atmosphere.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good and provides an accurate, high-level summary of the video. It correctly identifies the angle, height, and general movement. However, it is incomplete and fails to incorporate several key details and specific terminology required by the comprehensive instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **`high-angle, aerial shot`**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned high above the scene (aerial-level) and looking down at an angle (high angle).\n    *   **`of a video game`**: Correct. The visual style clearly indicates it's a computer-generated scene from a game.\n    *   **`keeps the entire play area sharp`**: This is an accurate description of the visual effect. Everything is in focus.\n    *   **`moves smoothly and gently from left to right`**: The camera's movement is indeed smooth, slow, and follows this direction.\n    *   **`peaceful, observational view`**: This is a good interpretation of the movement's purpose and the video's mood.\n\n*   **Slightly Inaccurate / Imprecise:**\n    *   **`deep focus`**: While technically everything is in focus, this term is more appropriate for a physical camera using a small aperture. The instructions provide a more precise way to describe this scenario: \"If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera).\" The sharpness here is artificial, a characteristic of a virtual camera rendering, not a choice of lens settings.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key pieces of information explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing `Video Speed`**: This is the most significant omission. The rapid movement of the cars and the shifting shadows of the day/night cycle clearly indicate the video is a **time-lapse**. The instructions state to specify this.\n*   **Missing Specific `Movement` Terminology**: The caption describes the movement as \"moves... from left to right.\" While correct, the instructions provide the specific term **trucking** for this type of sideways camera translation. Using the technical term would make the description more complete and professional.\n*   **Missing Nuance on `Focus`**: As mentioned under accuracy, the caption doesn't specify that the lack of depth of field is due to it being a virtual camera, a detail the instructions encourage you to include.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some instructions well but neglects others.\n\n*   **Strengths in Adherence:**\n    *   It correctly identifies **camera angle** and **camera height**.\n    *   It describes the **steadiness** (\"smoothly\") and **speed** (\"gently\") of the movement.\n    *   It is **concise**.\n    *   It correctly omits non-existent features like **lens distortion** and **Dutch angle**.\n\n*   **Weaknesses in Adherence:**\n    *   It fails to follow the primary instruction to identify altered **video speed** (the time-lapse).\n    *   It does not use the specific technical terms for camera movement (**trucking**) provided in the instructions.\n    *   It doesn't fully adhere to the instruction regarding focus in artificial environments, opting for a general term (`deep focus`) instead of describing the lack of realistic depth of field from a virtual camera.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption (Example of a Better Version)\n\nHere is a revised caption that more fully incorporates the instructions:\n\n**This is a high-angle, aerial-level time-lapse of a video game. The virtual camera, which renders the entire scene with perfect sharpness and no physical depth of field, trucks smoothly and slowly from left to right, offering a sweeping, observational view of the city.**",
