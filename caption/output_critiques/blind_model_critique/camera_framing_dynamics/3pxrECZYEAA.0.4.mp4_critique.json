    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera steadily zooms out, revealing an increasing number of atomic nuclei.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It is accurate in what it describes and follows the principle of conciseness, but it omits several key details required by the instructions, specifically regarding camera angle and focus.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n*   **\"steadily and smoothly zooms out\"**: This correctly identifies the camera's single, continuous movement, its steadiness, and its type (zoom out).\n*   **\"from a single atomic nucleus\"**: This accurately describes the starting point of the shot.\n*   **\"revealing a repeating pattern of many nuclei\"**: This correctly describes the visual result of the zoom-out.\n*   **\"against a black background\"**: This is an accurate description of the setting.\n\nThe caption perfectly captures the primary action and composition of the video.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **incomplete**. It successfully omits non-present elements like lens distortion and altered video speed, as instructed. However, it fails to include mandatory information that is clearly visible in the video.\n\n**What's Missing:**\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** The instruction requires specifying the camera angle (e.g., level angle, high angle). The video clearly uses a **level angle**, looking straight at the subject, but this is not mentioned.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is the most significant omission. The instructions ask for a detailed description of focus, depth of field, and the focus plane. The video has a very distinct **shallow depth of field**, where the central nucleus (and the column it belongs to) remains in sharp focus while the surrounding nuclei are blurred. This is a critical stylistic element of the shot that the caption completely ignores.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to some rules but fails on others.\n\n*   **Adheres:** It correctly follows the instruction to be concise and to omit descriptions of normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion.\n*   **Does Not Adhere:** It fails to provide a complete description of the **camera's configuration** because it omits the **camera angle** and **focus/depth of field**, both of which are explicitly required by the instructions. The goal is to be \"concise yet informative,\" and by omitting the focus, the caption loses a key piece of informative data.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more fully adheres to the instructions by including the missing information while remaining concise:\n\n**\"From a level angle, the camera steadily and smoothly zooms out from a single atomic nucleus to reveal a repeating grid of many nuclei. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the central column of nuclei in sharp focus while the surrounding ones remain blurred.\"**",
