    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good, concise summary of the video's general look and feel, but it is **not entirely accurate or complete** according to the specific technical requirements of the instructions. Its primary failure is misidentifying the camera movement, which is a critical element.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle...\"**: **Accurate.** The camera is positioned at a height consistent with a person holding it, and the horizon is kept parallel to the frame.\n*   **\"...maintaining deep focus and a large depth of field.\"**: **Accurate.** The people in the midground, the shop behind them, and even the buildings across the street in the background are all in reasonably sharp focus.\n*   **\"The camera smoothly pans from left to right...\"**: **Inaccurate.** This is the most significant error.\n    *   A **pan** is a rotational movement where the camera pivots horizontally on a fixed point (like turning your head).\n    *   In the video, the entire camera is moving laterally from left to right, parallel to the subject. This movement is called **trucking** (or a tracking shot). The changing perspective of the pillars and the storefront confirms the camera is translating through space, not just rotating.\n    *   The word \"smoothly\" is accurate, as the movement is very steady, suggesting the use of a stabilizer like a gimbal.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise, but it omits some details requested by the instructions.\n\n*   **What's Included:** Camera height, camera angle, focus/depth of field, and a (partially incorrect) description of movement.\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Movement Steadiness & Speed:** While \"smoothly\" implies steadiness, the instructions ask for this to be noted. The caption could also specify the movement is at a **slow, consistent speed**.\n    *   **Movement Type:** It fails to use the more precise and correct terminology (**trucking**) provided in the instructions.\n    *   **Omissions (Correctly Done):** The caption correctly follows the instruction to omit details about **video speed**, **lens distortion**, and **Dutch angle**, as none of these are present.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption successfully adheres to the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Use of Specific Terminology:** The caption fails to adhere to this key instruction. It uses the common but incorrect term \"pans\" instead of the more specific and accurate term **\"trucking,\"** which is explicitly listed as a type of movement to identify.\n*   **Informativeness:** The caption is informative on a basic level but lacks the technical precision required by the prompt, particularly regarding the camera's motion.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows your instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from a steady, eye-level perspective with a level angle, the camera trucks slowly and smoothly from left to right. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the people in the midground and the storefront in the background sharp throughout the movement.\"**",
