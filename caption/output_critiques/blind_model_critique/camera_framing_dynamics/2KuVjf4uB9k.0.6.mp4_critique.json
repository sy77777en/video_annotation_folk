    "pre_caption": "The video features an overhead-level camera at a high angle, looking down from above with a varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera, mounted on a drone, smoothly tracks a racing car from an aerial view, arcing from side to side with tilting and vertical movements to enhance excitement. The motion is quick and steady, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone flies overhead to track the racing car, continuously arcing from one side to the other, accompanied by tilting and up-and-down movements to enhance the excitement.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nYes, the caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and closely follows the detailed instructions provided. It successfully captures the key technical and stylistic elements of the video in a concise and informative manner.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\n\nThe caption correctly identifies and describes all the major visual components of the video.\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** `overhead-level camera at a high angle` is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned directly above and looking down on the action.\n*   **Dutch Angle & Rolling:** `varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling` is a precise and sophisticated observation. The camera clearly rolls on its axis as it follows the car, which is the cause of the dynamic tilt.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** `maintains deep focus with a large depth of field` is correct. The entire scene, from the car in the midground to the surrounding track and environment, is sharp and in focus.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is spot-on.\n    *   `smoothly tracks a racing car`: Correctly identifies the primary action (tracking) and its quality (smooth).\n    *   `arcing from side to side`: Accurately describes the circular path the camera takes around the car as it drifts.\n    *   `tilting and vertical movements`: Correctly notes the subtle changes in vertical angle and altitude.\n    *   `quick and steady, with no shaking`: Accurately captures the speed and stability of the drone footage.\n*   **Purpose:** `to enhance excitement` is a correct interpretation of the filmmaker's intent behind the dynamic camera work.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Excellent\n\nThe caption does a great job of including the required elements while correctly omitting those that are not present, as per the instructions.\n\n*   **Covered Elements:** Camera Angle, Height, Movements (tracking, arcing, tilting, steadiness, speed, purpose), Focus, and Dutch Angle are all included.\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so its omission is correct according to the rule: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed... there is no need to mention these.\"*\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no significant lens distortion, so its omission is also correct.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions & Conciseness: Very Good\n\nThe caption adheres well to the instructions, providing a concise yet informative description. However, there are minor opportunities to make it even more concise by removing slight redundancies.\n\n*   **Strengths:** It uses specific terminology from the instructions like `Dutch angle`, `camera rolling`, `deep focus`, `tracks`, and `arcing`.\n*   **Minor Redundancies for Improvement:**\n    *   `looking down from above` is redundant, as this is already implied by `overhead-level camera at a high angle`.\n    *   `from an aerial view` is redundant with `overhead-level camera`.\n    *   `with no shaking` is slightly redundant with `smoothly` and `steady`.\n\n### Suggested Refinement for Maximum Conciseness\n\nWhile the original caption is excellent, here is a slightly more streamlined version that eliminates the minor redundancies, making it even more potent:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"From a high, overhead angle, the camera smoothly tracks a racing car with a varying Dutch angle created by camera rolling. The shot maintains deep focus. The drone-mounted camera performs quick and steady arcing, tilting, and vertical movements to enhance the excitement of the action.\"\n\nThis revision combines a few ideas and removes repeated concepts, but the original caption is already of very high quality and fully meets the requirements of the prompt.",
