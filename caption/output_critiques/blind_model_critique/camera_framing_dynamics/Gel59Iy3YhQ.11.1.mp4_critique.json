    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks the avatar from a side view, trucking slightly to the right before smoothly transitioning to the left. As the avatar accelerates, the trucking matches its speed.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good for the video. While it is concise and partially accurate, it fails to meet several key requirements of the instructions, making it incomplete and insufficiently detailed.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its shortcomings:\n\n### 1. Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several mandatory descriptive elements required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption uses the general phrase \"side-view perspective,\" which is not specific enough. The instructions ask for precise terms like **level angle, low angle, eye-level, or hip-level**. The caption fails to describe either the angle or the height of the camera relative to the subject or the ground.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** There is no mention of the focus. The instructions explicitly require a description of the **depth of field** (e.g., deep, shallow), the **focus plane** (e.g., midground), and any **focus changes**. This is a major omission.\n*   **Movement Purpose:** While \"tracks the avatar\" implies a purpose, the instructions encourage stating it clearly. The movement serves to keep the avatar centered in the frame.\n\n### 2. Accuracy and Terminology\n\n*   **Vague Language:** The phrase \"transitioning to the left\" is imprecise. The correct term for a sideways camera movement is **trucking**. A more accurate description would be \"it trucks slightly to the right before trucking left.\"\n*   **Redundancy:** The final phrase \"as it moves\" is redundant, as the fact that the camera is \"matching the avatar's speed\" already implies the avatar is in motion.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to adhere to the core instruction of providing a \"concise yet **informative** description of the video’s and camera’s **configuration**.\" By omitting angle, height, and all focus details, it provides a very superficial account of the shot's technical and stylistic setup.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that correctly follows all the given instructions, assuming a typical side-scrolling game perspective:\n\n> \"From a **level angle** at the avatar's **eye-level**, the camera smoothly **tracks** the subject with a **deep depth of field**, keeping both the avatar and the background in sharp focus. The camera **trucks left**, matching the avatar's speed, after a brief initial adjustment where it **trucks slightly right** to maintain framing.\"\n\nThis revised caption is superior because it includes:\n*   **Camera Angle:** `level angle`\n*   **Camera Height:** `eye-level`\n*   **Focus:** `deep depth of field`, `keeping both the avatar and the background in sharp focus`\n*   **Movement:** Uses precise terms (`tracks`, `trucks left`, `trucks right`) and describes the purpose (`to maintain framing`).\n*   **Steadiness & Speed:** `smoothly`, `matching the avatar's speed`",
