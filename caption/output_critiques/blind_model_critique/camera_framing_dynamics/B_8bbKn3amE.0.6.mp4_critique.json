    "pre_caption": "From a smooth, aerial perspective, the camera tracks a climber on a mountain ridge with a counter-clockwise arc.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a high angle (looking down from above) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone arcs  counterclockwise to track the climber with some tilting down to focus on them and ends with a slight forward to approach them.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject from an aerial view while moving in an arc.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a high-quality, professional description that perfectly aligns with the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in its description of the video's technical and visual elements.\n\n*   **\"smooth, aerial perspective\"**: Correct. The shot is clearly from a drone (aerial) and is perfectly stabilized (smooth).\n*   **\"tracks a climber on a mountain ridge with a counter-clockwise arc\"**: Correct. The camera's primary movement is following the subject (tracking) while circling them from right to left (a counter-clockwise arc).\n*   **\"starts at a level angle and tilts down into a high-angle view\"**: Correct. The camera begins by looking straight at the climber on the ridge and gradually tilts downward as it moves, ending in a more pronounced high-angle shot.\n*   **\"rolling to create a dynamic Dutch angle\"**: Correct. The horizon is not level and its tilt changes throughout the shot, which is achieved by the camera rolling on its axis. \"Dynamic Dutch angle\" is the perfect term for this.\n*   **\"deep focus to keep the vast landscape sharp\"**: Correct. Both the climber (midground) and the distant mountains (background) are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"concludes with a slight forward movement toward the climber\"**: Correct. In the final moments, there is a subtle push-in (dolly forward) toward the subject.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly omitted as per the instructions.\n*   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable lens distortion, so this was also correctly omitted.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle**: Both are described accurately (\"aerial perspective,\" \"level angle,\" \"high-angle\").\n*   **Movements**: The caption masterfully combines multiple complex movements (tracking, arcing, tilting, rolling, and forward movement) into a clear and logical sequence. It also correctly identifies the smoothness of the shot.\n*   **Focus**: The deep focus is clearly noted.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\nThe caption follows the instructions precisely.\n\n*   **Conciseness**: It is concise yet packed with information. It avoids unnecessary words while providing a comprehensive technical summary.\n*   **Terminology**: It uses the correct and specific terminology requested (e.g., `aerial`, `tracks`, `arc`, `tilts down`, `rolling`, `Dutch angle`, `deep focus`).\n*   **Structure**: The description of movements and changes is presented in a logical, temporal order, making it easy to follow.\n*   **Omission of Negatives**: It correctly avoids mentioning that the video speed is normal or that there is no lens distortion, which is a key part of the conciseness instruction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a model caption. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of cinematography and a keen eye for detail. It perfectly balances the need for technical accuracy with clear, readable language, fulfilling every requirement of the detailed instructions.",
