    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward and moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and serves as a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy: Perfect**\n\n*   **\"aerial view with a high angle\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned high above the ground, consistent with an aerial or drone shot, and is angled downwards towards the landscape.\n*   **\"looking down on a coastal landscape with a lighthouse\"**: This correctly identifies the subject matter of the video.\n*   **\"deep focus, maintaining clarity across the scene\"**: This is accurate. The wide-angle lens and lighting conditions ensure that the entire scene, from the foreground cliffs to the background ocean and sky, remains sharp and in focus.\n*   **\"moves smoothly and slowly, both backward and upward\"**: This is a precise description of the camera's motion. The camera performs a slow, steady combined movement: it dollies backward (pulling away from the lighthouse) while simultaneously pedestaling or craning upward.\n*   **\"without any shaking\"**: The movement is indeed very stable, characteristic of a professional drone or a stabilized camera rig.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects of the camera's configuration as requested in the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height**: Correctly identified as \"aerial view\" and \"high angle.\"\n    *   **Focus**: Correctly described as \"deep focus.\"\n    *   **Movements**: The type (\"backward and upward\"), speed (\"slowly\"), and steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"without any shaking\") are all included. The purpose is also implied (\"providing a comprehensive view\").\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, adhering to the conciseness rule. There is no altered **video speed**, no noticeable **lens distortion**, and no **Dutch angle**, so these are rightly left out.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: The caption strikes the perfect balance. It avoids jargon where simple terms suffice (\"backward and upward\" is very clear) but includes technical terms like \"deep focus\" where they add value.\n*   **Covers Key Elements**: It systematically addresses the required points from the instructions (angle, height, movement, focus) without any fluff.\n*   **Describes Movement Properties**: It doesn't just state that the camera moves; it qualifies the movement with details on its direction, speed, and stability, exactly as instructed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is exceptionally well-written. It is a clear, accurate, and concise technical description that perfectly fulfills every requirement of the detailed instructions. No improvements are necessary.",
