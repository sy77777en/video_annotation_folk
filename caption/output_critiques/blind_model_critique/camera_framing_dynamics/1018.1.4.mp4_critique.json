    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a level camera angle. It begins with deep focus, capturing both men clearly.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video starts with deep focus, but as one of the two men walks toward the camera, it shifts to shallow focus, keeping him sharp in the foreground while the background and the midground become blurred.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is highly accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is 100% accurate.\n*   **\"shot at eye level with a level camera angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is not angled up or down and is positioned at a height that mimics a person's direct line of sight.\n*   **\"It begins with deep focus, capturing both men clearly\"**: This is correct. At the start of the video, both the man in the midground and the man working in the background are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"As one man walks toward the camera, the focus shifts to shallow, keeping him sharp in the foreground while blurring the background and midground\"**: This is a precise description of the action. The depth of field narrows as the subject approaches, a technique often called **focus tracking**, where the focus plane moves with the subject. The result is a shallow depth of field at the end.\n*   **\"The camera remains completely static throughout\"**: This is correct. There is no panning, tilting, dollying, or any other camera movement.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, covering all relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant ones.\n*   **Covered Aspects**: It successfully identifies and describes camera height, angle, focus (initial state, dynamic change, and final state), and movement (or lack thereof).\n*   **Omitted Aspects**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed**: It is at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot.\n\nThe description of the focus change is particularly well-done, explaining not just *that* it changed, but *how* and *why* (to follow the subject), and what the resulting effect was (blurred background).\n\n### Adherence to Instruction:\nThe caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n*   **Concise and Informative**: It packs all the necessary technical details into four clear, easy-to-read sentences without any fluff.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It uses correct terminology like \"eye level,\" \"level camera angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"shallow focus.\"\n*   **Logical Structure**: The description follows the temporal order of the video, starting with the initial setup and then describing the changes that occur.\n*   **Follows Negative Constraints**: It demonstrates a full understanding of the instructions by not mentioning the elements that were absent or at their default state (normal speed, no distortion, etc.).\n\nIn summary, this is a model caption that demonstrates a thorough understanding of both the video's technical properties and the specific requirements of the prompt.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is filmed at eye level with a level camera angle, starting with deep focus to clearly capture both men. As one man approaches the camera, the focus shifts to shallow, keeping him sharp in the foreground while blurring the background and midground.
