    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming out and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains significant errors in describing the camera movement and is incomplete in its description of the camera's position. While it correctly identifies the focus and unsteadiness, it misinterprets the primary cinematic techniques used, failing to adhere to the specific terminology requested in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"deep focus\"**: Correct. Both the man in the midground and the buildings in the background are kept in sharp focus throughout the shot.\n    *   **\"capturing a man in an orange jacket on a bridge\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the subject and setting.\n    *   **\"slightly unsteady with some shaking\"**: Correct. There is a noticeable handheld-style wobble throughout the camera movement.\n    *   **\"level camera angle\"**: Correct for the beginning of the shot.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"zooms out\"**: **This is the most significant error.** The camera is not zooming out (changing the lens's focal length). Instead, it is physically moving backward and upward. This is a **dolly out** and a **crane up**. The changing perspective between the man and the background buildings confirms physical movement, not an optical zoom.\n    *   **\"tilts up\"**: **This is also inaccurate.** A tilt is a rotational movement from a fixed point. The entire camera body is ascending. To keep the subject in the frame as the camera moves up and away, the lens is actually performing a slight **tilt down**. The primary movement is a **crane up**, not a tilt up.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is not sufficiently complete according to the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Height:** It fails to mention the initial **eye-level** height of the camera.\n*   **Missing - Angle Transition:** It correctly identifies the initial \"level camera angle\" but omits the crucial fact that the movement causes it to transition into a **high angle** shot, looking down on the subject.\n*   **Missing - Movement Terminology:** It fails to use the correct and more descriptive terms for the movement. The instructions specifically list \"craning\" and \"dollying,\" which are the precise movements occurring here. The caption oversimplifies and mislabels them.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows some instructions but fails on key points.\n\n*   **Followed:**\n    *   It is concise.\n    *   It correctly omits mentions of video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard.\n*   **Not Followed:**\n    *   It fails to provide an \"informative description of the... camera's configuration\" because it misidentifies the core movements.\n    *   It does not use the specific vocabulary for movements (**craning, dollying**) provided in the instructions, opting for the incorrect term \"zoom.\"\n    *   It does not fully describe the change in camera angle from start to finish.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**The video begins with a slightly unsteady, eye-level shot at a level angle, holding a man on a bridge in deep focus. The camera then slowly cranes up and dollies backward, transitioning into a high-angle view of the entire scene.**",
