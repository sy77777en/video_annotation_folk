    "pre_caption": "This ground-level, level-angle shot features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the Nike soccer ball and cleats in the foreground. The camera executes a smooth, clockwise arc around the ball while pulling back. The video employs a speed ramp effect: the motion begins slowly, accelerates rapidly, and then stops abruptly.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A speed ramp effect where playback speed shifts between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera arcs clockwise around the soccer ball, covering less than a quarter of a circle while moving backward. The movement starts slowly, suddenly speeds up, and then comes to a stop.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres to all the specified guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy: Perfect**\nThe caption flawlessly describes the visual events and technical specifications of the video.\n*   **Camera Position:** The description of a `ground-level, level-angle` shot is precise. The camera is very low to the ground and aimed straight ahead at the subject.\n*   **Focus:** The identification of a `shallow depth of field` with focus on the `foreground` (ball and cleats) is spot-on. The background is clearly and intentionally blurred.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of a `smooth, clockwise arc around the ball while pulling back` is highly accurate. It correctly identifies the rotational movement (`arc`), its direction (`clockwise`), its quality (`smooth`), and the simultaneous translational movement (`pulling back`).\n*   **Video Speed:** The term `speed ramp` is used correctly, and the explanation—\"the motion begins slowly, accelerates rapidly, and then stops abruptly\"—is a perfect, concise summary of what happens in the video.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting irrelevant details.\n*   **Included:** It covers camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and a detailed breakdown of camera movement and video speed alteration.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:** As per the instructions, it does not mention the absence of lens distortion, Dutch angles, or shot transitions, which keeps the description concise and focused on what is present.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\nThe caption follows the instructions to the letter.\n*   **Concise and Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical detail into two clear, easy-to-read sentences.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specified vocabulary accurately (e.g., `ground-level`, `level-angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `arc`, `speed ramp`).\n*   **Descriptive Detail:** It doesn't just name the effects; it describes them. For example, instead of just saying \"speed ramp,\" it explains *how* the speed changes, adding valuable context.\n*   **Logical Structure:** The caption is structured logically, starting with the static camera setup (position, focus) before moving on to the dynamic elements (movement, speed).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary model for the task. It demonstrates a complete understanding of both the video's content and the detailed requirements of the instructions. There are no improvements to suggest; it is an ideal response.",
