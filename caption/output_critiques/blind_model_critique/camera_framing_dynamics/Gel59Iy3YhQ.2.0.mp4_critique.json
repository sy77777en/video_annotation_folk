    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is a thorough evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** \"From a level angle, the camera smoothly tracks a figure in a boat from the side, moving rightward to follow its movement.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation:**\n\nThe caption is a good, accurate, and concise summary of the primary camera action. However, it is **incomplete** when measured against the specific requirements of the instructions.\n\n### **Detailed Feedback:**\n\n#### **Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** \"Level angle\" is a correct and precise description.\n*   **Movement Type & Purpose:** \"Tracks a figure... to follow its movement\" accurately describes both the type and purpose of the camera motion.\n*   **Movement Direction:** \"Moving rightward\" is a clear description of the camera's path.\n*   **Steadiness:** \"Smoothly\" correctly describes the quality of the movement.\n\n#### **Completeness: Needs Improvement**\n\nThe caption successfully identifies the angle and the basic movement, but it omits several key details explicitly requested in the instructions:\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Height:** The instruction asks for height (e.g., eye-level, water-level, hip-level). \"Level angle\" describes the camera's tilt, not its elevation relative to the ground or water. The camera could be on a dock (eye-level) or on another boat (water-level), which are two different configurations.\n*   **Missing - Movement Speed:** The caption notes the movement is \"smooth\" but doesn't specify its speed (e.g., slow, moderate, fast).\n*   **Missing - Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a significant omission. The instructions require a description of the depth of field (is the background blurry or sharp?), the focus plane (is the boat in the midground the only thing in focus?), and any focus changes.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions: Partial**\n\n*   **What it does well:** The caption is concise and correctly omits information about normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and lack of a Dutch angle, as instructed.\n*   **Where it falls short:** It fails to provide a complete description of the camera's configuration by leaving out the required details about height, speed, and focus.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is **good but not sufficient** for the given instructions. It provides an accurate but superficial description of the shot. To be fully compliant, it needs to incorporate the missing details about camera height, movement speed, and focus.\n\n### **Example of a More Complete Caption:**\n\nHere are two examples of how the caption could be improved to meet all the requirements, depending on the specific visual details of the video:\n\n*   **(If the background is blurry):** \"From an **eye-level**, level angle, the camera **slowly and smoothly** tracks right to follow a figure in a boat. The shot uses a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the boat in the **midground** in sharp focus while the background remains blurred.\"\n*   **(If the background is sharp):** \"From a **water-level**, level angle, the camera tracks right at a **moderate speed** to follow a figure in a boat. The shot maintains a **deep focus**, rendering both the boat in the midground and the distant shoreline in the background clearly.\"",
