    "pre_caption": "From a high, overhead perspective, the camera is tilted at a varying Dutch angle as it smoothly and rapidly flies in a complex pattern. It pans right to track a group of motorcyclists turning on a racetrack, maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone flies in a complex and dynamic pattern while swiftly panning right to track a group of oncoming motorcyclists turning on a race track. Its movement remains fast and energetic throughout.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption captures the general energy of the shot, it could be more precise and technically accurate. The term \"overhead perspective\" suggests a direct top-down, bird's-eye view, whereas the video likely features a more dynamic *high-angle* or *aerial-level* shot that changes altitude. The description of movement, \"pans right to track,\" is slightly contradictory; a camera flying through the air doesn't pan from a fixed point but rather *tracks* or *arcs*. A more accurate description would be that the camera *arcs clockwise while tracking* the motorcyclists. The phrase \"complex pattern\" is vague; it would be more descriptive to specify the nature of the flight, such as, \"the camera swoops down before leveling out.\" Furthermore, a shot like this, likely filmed with an FPV drone, would almost certainly exhibit some mild *barrel distortion* from its wide-angle lens, which is not mentioned. Finally, the caption omits the video speed; given the rapid movement, it's crucial to state whether this is *real-time playback* or if *fast-motion* has been applied to enhance the sense of speed.",
