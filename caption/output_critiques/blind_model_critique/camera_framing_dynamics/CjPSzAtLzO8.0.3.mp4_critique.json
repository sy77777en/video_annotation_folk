    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone flies in a complex and dynamic pattern while swiftly panning right to track a group of oncoming motorcyclists turning on a race track. Its movement remains fast and energetic throughout.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written and accurate caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its quality:\n\n### Accuracy:\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **Perspective:** \"From a high, overhead perspective\" correctly identifies both the **high angle** and the **overhead-level** height of the camera (likely a drone).\n*   **Dutch Angle:** \"tilted at a varying Dutch angle\" is a precise and sophisticated observation. The camera is indeed rolled, and the degree of tilt changes as it banks to follow the subjects, making \"varying\" the perfect descriptor.\n*   **Movement:** \"smoothly and rapidly flies in a complex pattern\" is an excellent summary. The movement is fluid (smooth), fast (rapid), and not a simple linear or arcing path (complex). The description \"pans right to track\" is also spot-on, correctly identifying that the camera rotates (pans) while simultaneously moving through space to follow (track) the motorcyclists.\n*   **Focus:** \"maintaining a deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp\" is perfectly accurate. The depth of field is large, and everything from the track to the background is in clear focus.\n\n### Completeness:\nThe caption is complete by including all the relevant information while correctly omitting what is not present, as per the instructions.\n*   **Included:** It covers camera angle, height, rotation (Dutch angle, panning), translation (tracking/flying), speed/steadiness of movement, and focus.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no significant lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Zooming:** The camera does not zoom, so this was correctly excluded.\n\n### Adherence to Instruction:\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a large amount of technical detail into two clear, readable sentences without any wasted words.\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology:** It effectively uses specific terms like \"Dutch angle,\" \"pans,\" \"track,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Describes Complexity:** It successfully describes the combination of movements (\"pans right to track\") and the overall path (\"complex pattern\") as instructed.\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** It demonstrates a clear understanding of the instruction to omit descriptions of standard features (like regular speed or no distortion) to maintain conciseness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis caption is a perfect example of how to apply the given instructions. It is accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and highly concise. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography terms and the ability to synthesize complex visual information into a clear, technical description. No improvements are needed.",
