    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, then transitions to hip level. It maintains a level angle throughout. The camera employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. The motion is a smooth drone shot, flying forward with a slight upward movement, capturing the graffiti-covered corridor.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a ground level and then moves to a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** A drone shot flies forward with a slight upward movement during the flight.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work. The provided caption is very good and effectively captures the key technical aspects of the video according to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy:\n*   **Camera Height:** The description of the camera starting low and transitioning higher is correct. However, the specific terms \"ground level\" and \"hip level\" are slightly inaccurate. The camera starts at a **low level** (perhaps knee-level) but not quite on the ground. It ends closer to **eye-level**. The description of the *change* in height is accurate, but the labels could be more precise.\n*   **Camera Angle:** \"Maintains a level angle throughout\" is perfectly accurate. The camera does not tilt up or down; it remains parallel to the ground plane.\n*   **Focus:** \"The camera employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field\" is entirely accurate. Both the foreground (nearby walls) and the background (the end of the corridor) are sharp and in focus.\n*   **Movement:** \"The motion is a smooth drone shot, flying forward with a slight upward movement\" is an excellent and accurate description.\n    *   **Smooth:** The movement is perfectly steady, suggesting a gimbal or drone.\n    *   **Drone shot:** This is a very plausible inference for how the shot was achieved.\n    *   **Flying forward:** Accurately describes the primary dolly/tracking motion.\n    *   **Slight upward movement:** Accurately describes the secondary pedestal/crane motion.\n    *   **Purpose:** \"capturing the graffiti-covered corridor\" correctly identifies the purpose of the shot.\n\n### Completeness:\n*   The caption successfully identifies and describes all the relevant and active features requested in the instructions: **camera height, camera angle, camera movement (type, steadiness, direction), and focus.**\n*   It correctly omits features that are not present or are standard, as per the instructions. For example:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is at a regular speed, so it was correctly not mentioned.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly not mentioned.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to describe rack focus or focus tracking.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon while still being informative. It combines multiple elements into a smooth, readable description.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct terminology from the instructions, such as \"level angle\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Structure:** It logically describes the camera's configuration and movement in a clear, easy-to-understand manner. Since there is only one continuous shot, there was no need to describe transitions.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate in all major aspects, complete in its coverage of the video's notable characteristics, and adheres perfectly to the spirit and letter of the instructions, especially regarding conciseness.\n\n**Minor Suggestion for Improvement:**\nTo be hyper-precise, you could adjust the height description slightly:\n\n*   **Slightly Improved Version:** \"The video begins with the camera at a **low level**, then smoothly **rises to eye-level**. It maintains a level angle throughout. The camera employs deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. The motion is a smooth drone shot, flying forward while simultaneously moving upward to capture the graffiti-covered corridor.\"",
