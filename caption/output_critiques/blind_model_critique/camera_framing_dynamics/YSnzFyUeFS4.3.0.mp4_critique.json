    "pre_caption": "This first-person perspective shot is filmed from eye level with a level angle, though a varying Dutch angle is present due to slight camera rolling. The video exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outwards. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire street scene sharp. The handheld movement simulates a person walking across the street, featuring smooth but slightly shaky panning and rolling motions.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera simulates the perspective of a person walking on the street, with smooth, slight rolling and panning motions to adjust the angle. The movement is somewhat shaky, adding to the realism.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the first-person perspective and eye-level framing, it oversimplifies the camera's movement and could be more specific about the focus. The description of \"panning to the left and forward motion\" as a combined action is misleading. In the video, the camera first pans left from the sidewalk to check for oncoming traffic, holds for a moment, and *then* begins its forward dolly motion across the street, with the pan correcting to a forward-facing view. The movement isn't just \"slightly shaky\"; it has a distinct, rhythmic bob and sway characteristic of a person walking at a brisk pace, which the caption fails to mention. Furthermore, while the focus is generally deep, calling it entirely sharp is inaccurate; the distant city lights and building signs in the background are noticeably soft and exhibit some bokeh, suggesting a shallower depth of field than implied, likely due to a wide aperture setting for the evening shot. The \"varying Dutch angle\" is a good observation, but it could be more descriptively linked to the natural side-to-side roll caused by the walker's gait. A more precise caption would sequence the movements (pan left, then dolly forward) and offer a more nuanced description of the focus and the specific character of the handheld motion.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a first-person perspective shot at eye level, featuring a dynamic sequence of camera movements. Initially, the camera pans left from the sidewalk to check for oncoming traffic, pausing momentarily before transitioning into a forward dolly motion across the street. As it moves forward, the pan adjusts to a forward-facing view. The handheld camera work simulates a brisk walking pace, characterized by a distinct, rhythmic bob and sway. The video exhibits a varying Dutch angle, linked to the natural side-to-side roll from the walker's gait. While the camera maintains a generally deep focus, the distant city lights and building signs in the background appear soft, with some bokeh, indicating a shallower depth of field due to a wide aperture setting for the evening shot.
