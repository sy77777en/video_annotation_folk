    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward and zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great test case. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nOverall, the caption is very good and largely successful in following the instructions. It is accurate, concise, and covers most of the key required elements. However, it could be improved by being more specific with technical terminology and by including the purpose of the distinct camera movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n\n*   **\"smooth camera movement at hip level\"**: Correct. The movement is steady, and the camera's height is positioned around the subject's hip/waist.\n*   **\"capturing a low-angle view\"**: Correct. The camera is angled upward at the woman.\n*   **\"The camera moves backward while simultaneously zooming in\"**: Perfectly accurate. This correctly identifies the two simultaneous actions that create the specific visual effect.\n*   **\"maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field, ensuring all elements remain sharp\"**: Correct. Both the foreground subject (the woman) and the background (the house) are in sharp focus throughout the shot.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete but misses a few key details that would make it more informative.\n\n*   **What it covers well:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"hip level\" - **Complete.**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"low-angle view\" - **Complete.**\n    *   **Movements (Type & Steadiness):** \"smooth,\" \"moves backward,\" \"zooming in\" - **Complete.**\n    *   **Focus (Depth & Changes):** \"maintaining deep focus with a large depth of field\" - **Complete.**\n\n*   **What could be added for better completeness:**\n    *   **Movement (Technical Term & Purpose):** The movement described (\"moves backward while simultaneously zooming in\") is a classic filmmaking technique known as a **dolly zoom** or **Vertigo effect**. While the description is accurate, using the technical term would be more concise and informative. Furthermore, the instruction asks for the **purpose** of the movement, which is highly relevant here. The purpose of a dolly zoom is to create a disorienting, unnatural perspective shift that can convey a character's psychological distress or a moment of revelation. The caption describes *what* the camera does but not *why* or what effect it creates.\n    *   **Movement (Speed):** The caption mentions the movement is \"smooth\" but doesn't specify its **speed**. A word like \"slow\" or \"deliberate\" would add more detail.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the instructions, especially regarding conciseness.\n\n*   **Positive Adherence:**\n    *   It correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or a **Dutch angle**, as none are present, following the instruction to \"not mention these\" if they are standard or absent.\n    *   It successfully combines multiple descriptors into a flowing sentence (e.g., \"smooth camera movement at hip level, capturing a low-angle view\").\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement in Adherence:**\n    *   The instruction asks for a description of \"movements (translation, rotation, zooming... complexity, and **purpose**).\" The caption fails to describe the **purpose** of the dolly zoom, which is a significant omission for this particular shot.\n    *   While not explicitly required, using the term \"dolly zoom\" would align better with the goal of being \"concise yet informative.\"\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that incorporates the feedback to be more complete and technically precise, while remaining concise:\n\n**\"The video features a smooth, slow dolly zoom at hip-level. This creates a disorienting effect as the camera dollies backward while zooming in on a woman, keeping her the same size in the frame as the background expands. The shot maintains a low angle and deep focus, ensuring both the subject and the house behind her remain sharp.\"**",
