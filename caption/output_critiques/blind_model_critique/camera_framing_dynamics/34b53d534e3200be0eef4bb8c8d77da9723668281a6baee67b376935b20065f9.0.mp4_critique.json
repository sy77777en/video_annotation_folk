    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, using a high angle to look down at a path covered in yellow leaves. It then smoothly tilts up and pans right, transitioning to a level angle. The focus is shallow, concentrating on the midground where a person is sitting against a hedge. The camera movement is very smooth, maintaining steadiness throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is tilting up and panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze a caption against a detailed set of instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of your caption's performance:\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and captures some key elements, but it has significant inaccuracies and omissions when measured against the specific instructions provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Feedback on the Caption**\n\n**Caption:** \"The video begins with the camera at hip level, using a high angle to look down at a path covered in yellow leaves. It then smoothly tilts up and pans right, transitioning to a level angle. The focus is shallow, concentrating on the midground where a person is sitting against a hedge. The camera movement is very smooth, maintaining steadiness throughout.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Accuracy: Where the Caption is Incorrect**\n\n*   **Starting Camera Height:** The caption states the camera begins at \"hip level.\" This is incorrect. The camera starts much lower, closer to **ground-level or knee-level**, looking down at the leaves. It *ends* near hip level, but it doesn't start there.\n*   **Focus Description:** This is the most significant inaccuracy. The caption claims the focus is on the midground throughout. In reality, the video **starts with the focus on the foreground** (the yellow leaves). As the camera moves, it performs a **rack focus**, shifting the plane of focus from the foreground leaves to the midground subject (the person). The caption completely misses this dynamic change, which is a key element of the shot.\n\n#### **2. Completeness: What the Caption Missed**\n\n*   **Camera Movement (Translation):** The caption correctly identifies the `tilt up` and `pan right`. However, it misses two other subtle but important movements:\n    *   **Pedestal Up:** The camera doesn't just tilt; it also moves vertically upwards. This is what changes the height from near-ground level to hip level.\n    *   **Dolly In:** The camera also moves slightly forward, closer to the subject.\n*   **Focus Change (Rack Focus):** As mentioned in the accuracy section, the instruction explicitly asks to describe focus changes like `rack focus`. The caption fails to identify or describe this crucial action. It only describes the final state of the focus, not the transition.\n*   **Focus Plane (Initial):** The caption omits that the initial focus plane is the **foreground**.\n\n#### **3. Adherence to Instructions: How Well it Followed the Rules**\n\n*   **What it did well:**\n    *   It correctly identified the starting `high angle` and the transition to a `level angle`.\n    *   It correctly described the `shallow` depth of field and the `steadiness` of the movement.\n    *   It correctly followed the conciseness rule by not mentioning normal video speed, lack of distortion, or lack of a Dutch angle.\n*   **Where it fell short:**\n    *   It failed to provide a complete and accurate description of the camera's movements, missing the `pedestal` and `dolly`.\n    *   It completely failed to follow the instruction to describe dynamic focus changes, missing the `rack focus`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it misrepresents the starting camera height and, more importantly, fails to describe the dynamic rack focus, which is a central and intentional cinematic technique used in the video. It provides an incomplete picture of the camera's movement and an inaccurate description of how focus is handled.\n\n---\n\n### **An Improved Caption Following the Instructions**\n\nHere is a caption that more accurately and completely follows the given instructions:\n\n\"The shot begins at a **low, near-ground level** with a **high angle**. The depth of field is **shallow**, with the **focus on the foreground leaves**. The camera then executes a smooth, complex movement, simultaneously **tilting up, panning right, pedestaling up, and dollying slightly forward**. During this movement, it performs a **rack focus** from the foreground to the midground. The shot concludes at **hip-level** with a **level angle**, holding focus on a person sitting against a hedge. The entire movement is slow and very steady.\"",
