    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing counterclockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The description of an \"aerial-level camera with a high angle\" is perfectly accurate. The shot is clearly taken from a significant height (likely a drone), looking down on the subject.\n*   **Focus:** The caption correctly identifies \"deep focus,\" as everything from the island in the midground to the distant horizon is sharp and clear.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the camera's movement as a \"smoothly arcs counterclockwise around the island\" is precise. The camera orbits the subject steadily, revealing different facets of the landscape.\n\n### Completeness\n*   The caption successfully covers all the key, observable elements requested in the instructions: camera height, angle, focus, and movement (including its type, steadiness, direction, and purpose).\n*   It correctly identifies the purpose of the movement as \"providing a comprehensive view of the terrain and surrounding water.\"\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption adheres to the instruction to be concise. It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all standard or absent in the video.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specific and appropriate terminology from the instructions, such as \"aerial-level,\" \"high angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"arcs counterclockwise.\"\n*   **Structure:** Since the video is a single, continuous shot, the caption describes it as such without needing to break it down into segments, which is the correct approach.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of what was requested. It is technically accurate, comprehensive in its description of the relevant features, and perfectly follows the formatting and conciseness guidelines.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a breathtaking aerial view of a coastal landscape from a high angle, likely using a drone. The scene is in sharp focus throughout, from the island in the midground to the distant horizon. The camera gracefully arcs counterclockwise around the island, offering a complete and steady view of the terrain and surrounding waters.",
