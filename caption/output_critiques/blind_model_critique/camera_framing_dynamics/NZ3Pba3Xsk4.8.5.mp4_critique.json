    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward, gradually panning right to adjust its orientation. Toward the end, it ceases panning and continues moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect execution of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n*   **\"eye-level, level-angle shot\"**: This is correct. The camera is held at a height and angle consistent with a person walking and looking forward.\n*   **\"deep focus that keeps the entire scene sharp\"**: This is also correct. The foreground path, the midground trees, and even the more distant parts of the forest are all in reasonably sharp focus. There is no shallow depth of field blurring the background.\n*   **\"moves forward with a slight shake\"**: This perfectly describes the camera's movement. It is a forward dolly motion, and the \"slight shake\" accurately captures the natural instability of being handheld or body-mounted during a walk, as opposed to a perfectly smooth gimbal or track shot.\n*   **\"gradually panning to the right to follow the path\"**: The camera does indeed pan right to keep the curving path centered in the frame. The word \"gradually\" correctly describes the slow, steady nature of the pan.\n*   **\"Towards the end, it stops panning and continues moving straight ahead\"**: This is an excellent observation. As the path straightens, the panning motion ceases, and the camera's movement becomes a pure forward dolly. Describing this change in movement shows a high level of attention to detail.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete by including all the *relevant* information requested in the instructions while correctly omitting the irrelevant parts.\n*   **Included**: It covers camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and a detailed description of the camera's complex movement (translation, rotation, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   **Correctly Omitted**:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes**: The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions needed to be described.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions flawlessly.\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical detail into two clear, easy-to-read sentences.\n*   **Describes Configuration**: It perfectly details the camera's configuration and dynamic changes throughout the shot.\n*   **Handles Movement Complexity**: It doesn't just say \"the camera moves.\" It breaks down the movement into its components (dolly forward, pan right), describes their qualities (slight shake, gradual), explains their temporal relationship (panning occurs in the first part, then stops), and even states the purpose (\"to follow the path\").\n*   **Follows Negative Constraints**: The caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions by *not* mentioning the standard, default, or absent features (normal speed, no distortion, etc.), which is key to achieving conciseness.\n\nIn summary, the caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the provided instructions. It is accurate, thorough in its relevant details, and perfectly concise by omitting unnecessary information.",
