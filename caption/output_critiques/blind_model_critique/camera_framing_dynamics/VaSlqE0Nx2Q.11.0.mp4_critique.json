    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your instructions, here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** This is a static, eye-level shot filmed from a level angle. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe provided caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to all the given instructions.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **\"static\"**: This is correct. The camera's position and framing are completely fixed throughout the video; there is no panning, tilting, zooming, or any other movement.\n*   **\"eye-level shot\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned at a height that aligns with the eye level of a person sitting at the desk, creating a natural and direct perspective.\n*   **\"level angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is not tilted up (low angle) or down (high angle). It looks straight ahead, parallel to the ground, which is evident from the straight horizontal lines of the desk and window sill.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping a large depth of field sharp\"**: This is perfectly accurate. All elements in the frame, from the laptop in the midground to the bookshelf and window in the background, are in sharp focus. The caption correctly identifies this as deep focus and explains what that means (large depth of field).\n\n**2. Completeness & Conciseness:**\n*   The caption successfully describes all the key, non-default characteristics of the shot as required by the instructions: movement (static), height (eye-level), angle (level), and focus (deep).\n*   It correctly follows the instruction for conciseness by omitting information about default settings. There is no need to mention:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is at a normal, real-time speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible barrel or fisheye distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is not tilted.\n*   By leaving these out, the caption remains focused and efficient.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   The caption perfectly fulfills the core request to provide a \"concise yet informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n*   It uses the precise terminology specified in the instructions (e.g., \"static,\" \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus\").\n*   The structure is clear and logical, presenting the information in an easy-to-understand manner.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is a precise and professional description of the shot's technical attributes.",
