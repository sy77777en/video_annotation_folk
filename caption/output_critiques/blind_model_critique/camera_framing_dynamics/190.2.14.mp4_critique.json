    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use “focus on the man in the foreground” rather than “focus on the foreground.” Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase “tracking the subject(s).” Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe caption is good and captures the main cinematic elements of the shot, but it contains one significant inaccuracy regarding camera height.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **Accurate:** The description of a **low angle**, **shallow depth of field**, focus on the **foreground subjects**, and the **smooth backward movement** are all perfectly accurate. The camera is indeed looking up at the subjects, the background is nicely blurred, and the camera leads the couple by moving backward.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the camera height as **\"eye level\" is incorrect.** The camera is positioned significantly lower than the subjects' eyes, closer to their waists or hips. This lower position is what creates the \"low angle\" shot mentioned in the caption. An eye-level shot would be positioned at the subjects' eye height, resulting in a level angle, not a low one.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   The caption is very complete according to the instructions. It successfully identifies and describes all the key configurations present in the video:\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** It addresses both, though height is inaccurate.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly identifies the shallow depth of field and the focus plane (foreground).\n    *   **Movement:** It accurately describes the type (backward), steadiness (smoothly), and purpose (leading the subjects).\n*   It correctly omits mentions of video speed, lens distortion, and Dutch angle, as none of these are present, adhering to the instruction to be concise.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions**\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the prompt's structure. It provides a concise, informative description covering the required elements. The only failure in adherence is the factual error in describing the camera height.\n\n### **Improved Caption Example**\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracy and uses slightly more precise terminology, fully aligning with the instructions:\n\n\"The video is captured from a **hip-level** height and a **low angle**, looking up at the subjects. It uses a **shallow depth of field**, keeping the man and woman in the foreground in sharp focus. The camera executes a **smooth reverse tracking shot**, moving backward to lead the subjects as they walk toward it.\"",
