    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It accurately describes the most obvious aspects of the shot (the angle and movement) in a concise way. However, it misses several key details required by the instructions, particularly concerning camera height and focus, which are significant stylistic elements of the video.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe information present in the caption is highly accurate:\n*   **\"From a level angle...\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned parallel to the ground, not pointing up or down.\n*   **\"...the camera smoothly tracks...\"**: Correct. The camera moves parallel to the subject's path, and the movement is perfectly steady and fluid.\n*   **\"...a small, silhouetted character from the side...\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the subject, its lighting, and its framing.\n*   **\"...moving rightward through the foggy, dark landscape.\"**: Correct. This describes the direction of movement and the environment.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThis is where the caption falls short. It omits several required elements that are clearly visible in the video:\n\n*   **Missing - Camera Height:** The camera is positioned very low, close to the character's height but not at ground level. The instruction asks for height (e.g., *eye-level, hip-level, low-level*). This should have been described as **low-level**.\n*   **Missing - Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a major omission. The video has a very distinct **shallow depth of field**. The character in the midground is in sharp focus, while the background is heavily blurred. This is a crucial part of the shot's aesthetic, as it isolates the character from the environment.\n*   **Missing - Focus Changes:** The camera maintains focus on the character as it moves across the frame. This is a form of **focus tracking**, which should have been mentioned. The focus plane is consistently on the **midground**.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is very concise, as requested.\n    *   **Correct Omissions:** It correctly avoids mentioning normal video speed, the absence of lens distortion, and the lack of a Dutch angle, which aligns with the instruction to only mention these if they are present or altered.\n    *   **Terminology:** It uses the correct term \"tracks\" to describe the camera movement.\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   It fails to provide a complete description of the \"camera's configuration,\" specifically omitting the required details about **height** and **focus**. The instructions explicitly ask for these elements to be covered.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the missing details while remaining concise, fully adhering to the instructions:\n\n**\"From a low, level angle, the camera smoothly tracks right, maintaining a shallow depth of field with focus locked on a small, silhouetted character in the midground as it moves through a foggy, dark landscape.\"**",
