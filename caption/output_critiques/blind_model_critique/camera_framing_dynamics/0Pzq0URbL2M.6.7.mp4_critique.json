    "pre_caption": "The video features a smooth forward-moving camera at eye level, maintaining a level angle. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the scene clearly without any lens distortion. The camera steadily advances along the road, focusing on the sunset in the distance.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is very good and closely follows the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nYes, the caption is very good. It is accurate, concise, and successfully captures the most important technical and stylistic elements of the video as required by the detailed instructions. It correctly identifies the key aspects of movement, focus, and framing while adhering to the rule of omitting information for \"normal\" or absent features.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback Breakdown\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in all its claims:\n*   **\"smooth forward-moving camera\"**: Correct. The movement is a continuous, stable push forward, likely from a vehicle-mounted gimbal.\n*   **\"at eye level, maintaining a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera's perspective is consistent with being inside a car, and the horizon remains perfectly level throughout.\n*   **\"employs deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: Correct. Everything from the immediate foreground (road markings) to the far background (buildings and sunset) is in sharp focus.\n*   **\"capturing the scene clearly\"**: Correct. This is a direct result of the deep focus.\n*   **\"without any lens distortion\"**: Correct. Straight lines, such as telephone poles and road edges, remain straight even at the periphery of the frame.\n*   **\"steadily advances along the road, focusing on the sunset\"**: Correct. The movement is steady, and the compositional focus (the main point of interest) is clearly the sunset, which the camera moves toward.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: **Very Good**\n\nThe caption covers the most critical elements requested in the instructions.\n*   **Covered:** Camera movement (type, steadiness), camera height, camera angle, focus (depth), and lens distortion.\n*   **Partially Covered/Could Be More Specific:**\n    *   **Movement Type:** \"Forward-moving\" is accurate and clear. To be more technical, as suggested by the instructions, it could be described as a **dolly forward** or **forward tracking** shot.\n    *   **Movement Speed:** The caption implies a steady speed with the word \"steadily,\" but doesn't explicitly state that the speed is **constant and moderate**. This is a minor omission.\n*   **Correctly Omitted (as per instructions):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** There is no tilt, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is fixed, so there was no need to describe a rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: **Excellent**\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions' intent.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is compact and avoids unnecessary words while remaining informative. This is a key strength.\n*   **Informative Description:** It successfully describes the video's and camera's configuration as requested.\n*   **Follows Negative Constraints:** It correctly avoids mentioning regular video speed, the absence of a Dutch angle, or the lack of lens distortion (though it does mention the lack of distortion, which is acceptable as it confirms a quality of the image).\n*   **Terminology:** It uses appropriate terms like \"deep focus,\" \"large depth of field,\" and \"level angle.\"\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Improvement for Even Greater Precision\n\nWhile the original caption is excellent, here is a revised version that incorporates the minor suggestions for added technical specificity, making it even more aligned with the detailed instructions.\n\n**Revised Caption Example:**\n\n> The camera executes a smooth **dolly forward** at a **constant, moderate speed**, positioned at eye-level with a level angle. Utilizing **deep focus**, the shot maintains a large depth of field, keeping the entire scene from the foreground road to the distant sunset in sharp focus. No lens distortion is apparent.",
