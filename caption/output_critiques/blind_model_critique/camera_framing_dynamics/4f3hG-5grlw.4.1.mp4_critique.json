    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shot as being generally eye-level and handheld, it lacks specificity and misses several key cinematic choices that define the scene's tone. For instance, the description of \"deep focus\" is slightly inaccurate; the video actually employs a moderately shallow depth of field where the focus plane is clearly on the two midground characters, leaving the foreground character slightly soft to direct the viewer's attention. The term \"relatively sharp\" could be improved by specifying this focus plane. Furthermore, the \"slow, unsteady movement\" is not random but highly motivated; the camera performs a very slow truck to the right while simultaneously panning slightly left, creating a subtle parallax effect that builds tension and keeps the three-character composition balanced. The movement isn't just \"unsteady\" but has a naturalistic \"breathing\" quality typical of a skilled operator. Finally, the caption misses a subtle but important vertical movement: the camera slowly pedestals down throughout the shot, transitioning from eye-level to a slightly lower angle, which subtly shifts the power dynamic in the conversation by making the seated characters appear more grounded and imposing as the scene progresses.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This scene features a moderately shallow depth of field, focusing on the two midground characters while the foreground character remains slightly soft, guiding the viewer's attention. The camera, operated with a skilled hand, performs a slow truck to the right while panning slightly left, creating a subtle parallax effect that builds tension and maintains a balanced composition. The movement has a naturalistic \"breathing\" quality, enhancing the scene's realism. Additionally, the camera slowly pedestals down from eye-level to a slightly lower angle, subtly shifting the power dynamic by making the seated characters appear more grounded and imposing as the conversation unfolds.",
