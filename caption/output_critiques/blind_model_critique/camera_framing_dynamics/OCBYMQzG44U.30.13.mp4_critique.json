    "pre_caption": "This eye-level, deep-focus shot exhibits mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward slightly. The camera executes a smooth, quick left pan and then moves forward at a regular speed toward the arched doorway.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans left quickly and then slightly moves forward at a regular speed toward the arched doorway.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the basic sequence of a pan followed by forward movement, it could be more precise and evocative. The term \"eye-level\" might be inaccurate; the shot appears to be from a lower, hip-level height, which serves to make the architecture feel more imposing. The description of \"deep-focus\" is likely incorrect, as a shot like this would typically use a shallower depth of field to guide the viewer's eye; for instance, the focus might shift from the bookshelves on the right to the stained-glass window during the pan, and then track with the distant arched doorway as the camera moves forward, blurring the passing side walls. The phrase \"moves forward\" is too generic; \"dollies forward\" is the correct technical term and better conveys the smooth, gliding quality of the motion. Additionally, the caption misses the opportunity to describe the subtle barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens that enhances the scale of the hall and the purpose of the movement, which is to build suspense and draw the viewer toward the mysterious doorway.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This hip-level shot, with a shallow depth of field, captures the grandeur of the architecture, making it feel more imposing. The camera executes a smooth, quick left pan, shifting focus from the bookshelves on the right to the stained-glass window, before dollying forward toward the distant arched doorway. The subtle barrel distortion from the wide-angle lens enhances the scale of the hall, with straight lines near the edges bowing outward slightly. This movement builds suspense, drawing the viewer toward the mysterious doorway while the side walls blur past.",
