    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to break down the detailed requirements of the instruction.\n\nHere is a detailed feedback on the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **partially accurate but largely incomplete and non-compliant** with the detailed instructions. While it correctly identifies that the camera is static, it fails to provide the required technical details about focus and other camera properties. Instead, it offers a subjective description of the video's content, which the instructions explicitly steer away from.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Accurate:** \"The video is static with no camera movement.\" This is correct. The camera does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom throughout the shot.\n*   **Inaccurate/Misleading:** \"The focus is on the yellow ink...\" This is a common mistake. The caption describes the *subject* of the video (what the audience should focus on) rather than the *technical camera focus* (depth of field, focus plane). The instruction requires a description of the optical properties of the lens and camera settings, not the narrative subject.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is highly incomplete. It omits several key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The caption does not mention that the shot is filmed from a **level angle** at roughly **eye-level** with the subject.\n*   **Focus (Technical Details):** This is the biggest omission. The caption fails to describe:\n    *   **Depth of Field:** The video clearly has a **shallow depth of field**.\n    *   **Focus Plane:** The focus is fixed on the **midground**, where the ink is initially dropped.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** It doesn't state that the focus is **fixed** and does not change (e.g., no rack focus).\n    *   **Effect of Focus:** It misses the opportunity to describe how the ink becomes blurry as it spreads away from the fixed focal plane, which is a key visual characteristic of the shot.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness vs. Information:** The caption is concise, but at the expense of being informative. The phrase \"static with no camera movement\" is slightly redundant; \"The shot is static\" is more concise and sufficient.\n*   **Scope of Description:** The instruction asks for a description of the **\"video’s and camera’s configuration.\"** The second half of the caption—\"creating a vivid and dynamic visual effect against a white background\"—is a subjective, artistic interpretation of the *content*. This is precisely the kind of description the technical instructions are designed to avoid.\n*   **Ignoring Negative Constraints:** The caption correctly omits mentions of video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard/absent, which follows the instruction's guidance to be concise.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"The shot is static, filmed from a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field with the focus plane fixed on the midground. As the yellow ink disperses from its entry point, the tendrils moving toward the foreground and background become progressively blurred.\"**\n\n### Why This Improved Caption is Better\n\n*   **Accurate & Technical:** It uses precise terminology like \"static,\" \"level angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"focus plane.\"\n*   **Complete:** It covers all the relevant, non-standard aspects of the shot: camera stillness, angle, and the specific details of the focus.\n*   **Adherent to Instructions:** It describes the *camera's configuration and its effect on the image* rather than offering a subjective opinion on the content. It remains concise while providing all necessary technical information.",
