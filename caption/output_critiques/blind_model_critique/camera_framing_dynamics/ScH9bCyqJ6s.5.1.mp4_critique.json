    "pre_caption": "This is a static, bird's-eye view shot of a person's hands holding a smartphone's circuit board. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the circuit board in the midground, specifically on the tip of a screwdriver pointing at one of the camera lenses.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a bird's-eye view angle (looking down directly at the ground).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** This is a static, bird's-eye view shot of a person's hands holding a smartphone's circuit board. The camera uses a shallow depth of field, with the focus set on the circuit board in the midground, specifically on the tip of a screwdriver pointing at one of the camera lenses.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown:\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   **Camera Movement:** The caption correctly identifies the shot as **\"static,\"** which is accurate as there is no panning, tilting, zooming, or any other movement.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The description **\"bird's-eye view\"** is precise. This angle looks directly down on the subject from above, which also implicitly covers the \"overhead-level\" height.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** The caption accurately notes the **\"shallow depth of field,\"** which is evident in the sharp focus on the circuit board and the soft blur of the hands and the surface below. It correctly identifies the **focus plane** as the \"midground\" (the circuit board) and is commendably specific by pinpointing the exact point of focus: **\"the tip of a screwdriver.\"**\n\n**2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\nThe caption masterfully follows the instructions, including what to describe and what to omit.\n\n*   **Included Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Movement:** Described as \"static.\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Described as \"bird's-eye view.\"\n    *   **Focus (Depth & Plane):** Described as \"shallow depth of field\" with focus on the \"midground.\"\n\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly, per the conciseness rule):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video plays at a regular speed, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is fixed, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n\n**3. Conciseness:**\nThe caption is a model of conciseness. It packs all the necessary technical information into two clear, well-structured sentences without any redundant words. Using \"bird's-eye view\" efficiently combines the concepts of angle and height.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption is a perfect example of how to apply the given instructions. It is technically accurate, covers all relevant aspects of the shot's configuration, and demonstrates an excellent understanding of the conciseness rule by omitting unnecessary information. No improvements are needed.",
