    "pre_caption": "The video features an eye-level camera capturing a low-angle shot, looking up at the subjects. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the old man in the midground. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, with some shaking, and it captures an over-the-shoulder shot, centering the old man.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera captures an unsteady over-the-shoulder shot, centering the old man in the middle ground.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key cinematic elements like the angle, depth of field, and general framing. However, it contains a significant contradiction regarding camera height and angle, and it lacks the specificity in describing camera movement that the instructions require.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption is correct in identifying a **low-angle shot**, a **shallow depth of field**, the focus on the **midground** subject (the old man), the **unsteady/shaking** movement, and the use of an **over-the-shoulder shot**.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:** The primary inaccuracy is the phrase \"**eye-level camera capturing a low-angle shot**.\" This is a contradiction.\n    *   An **eye-level camera** implies the camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, which typically results in a **level angle shot**.\n    *   A **low-angle shot** requires the camera to be positioned *below* the subject's eye level (e.g., at chest-level, hip-level, or even ground-level) and tilted upward.\n    *   In the video, the camera is clearly positioned at a **chest or hip-level height** to achieve the low angle.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it omits key details requested in the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Camera Height:** While it incorrectly states \"eye-level,\" it fails to provide the correct height, such as **chest-level** or **hip-level**.\n*   **Missing Specifics of Camera Movement:** The instruction asks for the *type* of movement (tracking, dollying, panning, etc.). The caption only describes the *quality* of the movement (\"slightly unsteady, with some shaking\"). It misses that the camera is performing a slow **tracking** motion to follow the man and a very subtle **dolly-in** (moving forward). Describing it as just \"movement\" is too generic.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to some instructions but fails on others.\n\n*   **Adhered:**\n    *   It correctly omits mentions of video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard/absent.\n    *   It correctly identifies the focus plane (midground) and depth of field (shallow).\n    *   It is reasonably concise.\n\n*   **Did Not Adhere:**\n    *   It failed to provide a concise yet *informative* description of the camera's configuration due to the height/angle contradiction.\n    *   It did not specify the *type* of camera movement (e.g., tracking, dollying) as explicitly requested.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**From a chest-level height, the camera captures a low-angle, over-the-shoulder shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the man in the midground in sharp focus. The handheld camera is slightly unsteady as it performs a slow tracking motion to keep the man centered, subtly dollying forward.**",
