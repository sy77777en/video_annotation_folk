    "pre_caption": "The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, causing straight lines to curve outward. The camera is at ground level with a level angle, using deep focus with a large depth of field. It captures an unsteady side-tracking shot, following a skateboarder moving left. The camera moves up and down as the skateboarder jumps mid-video and pans slightly left at the end as the skateboarder moves away, with noticeable shaking throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** An unsteady side-tracking shot follows a person skateboarding to the left. The camera moves up and down as the person jumps mid-video and pans slightly left at the end as the skateboarder moves away.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving leftward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a high-quality, accurate, and comprehensive description that adheres exceptionally well to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is excellent. It successfully synthesizes a large number of technical details into a concise and readable description. It correctly identifies all the key visual characteristics of the video and uses the precise terminology requested in the instructions.\n\n### Feedback on Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n*   **\"Noticeable fisheye distortion\"**: This is correct. The wide-angle lens causes significant curvature at the edges of the frame, particularly visible in the pavement lines and the horizon.\n*   **\"Camera is at ground level with a level angle\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera is extremely low, capturing the action from the perspective of the skateboard's wheels, and it is pointed straight ahead, parallel to the ground.\n*   **\"Deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: This is accurate. Both the skateboarder in the midground and the buildings in the background are kept in reasonably sharp focus, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **\"Unsteady side-tracking shot, following a skateboarder moving left\"**: This correctly identifies the primary camera movement (tracking), its direction (left), its purpose (following the subject), and its quality (unsteady).\n*   **\"The camera moves up and down as the skateboarder jumps\"**: This accurately captures the secondary vertical movement (a small pedestal up/down) that coincides with the skateboarder's trick.\n*   **\"Pans slightly left at the end\"**: This correctly notes the final rotational adjustment the camera makes to keep the subject in the frame as he moves further away.\n*   **\"Noticeable shaking throughout\"**: This is an accurate assessment of the camera's stability, which is clearly handheld and shaky.\n\n### Feedback on Completeness\nThe caption is complete according to the instructions' guidelines for inclusion and omission:\n*   **Included Elements**: It covers all the relevant, observable aspects: lens distortion, camera height, camera angle, focus/depth of field, and a detailed breakdown of camera movement (type, steadiness, direction, and temporal sequence).\n*   **Omitted Elements**: It correctly follows the instruction to omit details that are not present or are standard. It does not mention video speed (which is regular), Dutch angles (none are present), or shot transitions (it's a single shot). This demonstrates a good understanding of the conciseness requirement.\n\n### Feedback on Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the instructions precisely:\n*   **Conciseness**: It is concise yet informative, avoiding filler words and combining multiple observations into a single, flowing sentence.\n*   **Terminology**: It uses the specific vocabulary requested, such as \"fisheye distortion,\" \"ground level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\" \"tracking,\" and \"pans.\"\n*   **Movement Description**: It perfectly describes the complex camera movement by breaking it down into its constituent parts (tracking, vertical movement, panning) and describing them in temporal order (\"mid-video,\" \"at the end\"), just as the instructions require.\n*   **Clarity**: The description is easy to understand and allows a reader to form a clear mental image of the shot's technical execution without seeing the video.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is accurate, thorough, and well-written.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases distinct fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. Positioned at ground level with a level angle, the camera employs deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field. It captures an unsteady side-tracking shot, following a skateboarder moving left. As the skateboarder jumps mid-video, the camera moves up and down, and it pans slightly left at the end as the skateboarder moves away, with noticeable shaking throughout.",
