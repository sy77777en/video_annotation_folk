    "pre_caption": "This is an eye-level, slightly unsteady shot that moves backward to follow two men in clown masks as they run through a long hall. In the latter part of the clip, the camera also trucks slightly to the right. The video uses a shallow depth of field, but the rapid movement of both the camera and the subjects causes them to frequently shift in and out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video uses shallow focus, but the camera and subjects' movements cause subjects to alternate between being in and out of focus, making it hard to determine the depth of camera focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward, adding a slight truck to the right in the latter part of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good for this video. It is accurate, concise, and effectively follows the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is successful:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Movement:** The description of the camera \"mov[ing] backward to follow two men\" and later \"truck[ing] slightly to the right\" is a precise and accurate account of the camera's motion.\n*   **Steadiness:** Identifying the shot as \"slightly unsteady\" correctly captures the handheld or dynamic nature of the filming.\n*   **Focus:** The explanation that the \"shallow depth of field\" combined with \"rapid movement\" causes subjects to \"frequently shift in and out of focus\" is a nuanced and highly accurate observation. It correctly diagnoses not just the focus effect but also its cause.\n*   **Height:** \"Eye-level\" is an accurate description of the camera's vertical position relative to the subjects.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant details required by the instructions while omitting the unnecessary ones:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** It correctly identifies the \"eye-level\" height. While it doesn't explicitly state \"level angle,\" this is strongly implied by the height and lack of any mention of a high or low angle.\n*   **Camera Movement:** It covers the type (backward movement, trucking), purpose (to follow), and steadiness (slightly unsteady) of the camera's motion. It also correctly notes the temporal order of the movements (\"In the latter part...\").\n*   **Focus:** It describes both the depth of field (\"shallow\") and the dynamic changes in focus, fulfilling that part of the instruction perfectly.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is lean and informative. It avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"moves backward\" instead of \"dollies out\").\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, as none are present. This shows a clear understanding of the \"only mention if present\" rule.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and easy to understand, effectively communicating the technical aspects of the shot without being overly technical.\n\n### Minor Point for Improvement\n*   To be perfectly compliant with the instructions, which separate **camera angle** and **camera height**, the caption could explicitly add \"level-angle.\" For example: \"This is a **level-angle,** eye-level, slightly unsteady shot...\" However, this is a very minor point, and the current caption is excellent as is.",
