    "pre_caption": "This is an eye-level, slightly unsteady shot that moves backward to follow two men in clown masks as they run through a long hall. In the latter part of the clip, the camera also trucks slightly to the right. The video uses a shallow depth of field, but the rapid movement of both the camera and the subjects causes them to frequently shift in and out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video uses shallow focus, but the camera and subjects' movements cause subjects to alternate between being in and out of focus, making it hard to determine the depth of camera focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward, adding a slight truck to the right in the latter part of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately captures the core action, it could be enhanced with more technical precision and evocative detail to better reflect the likely visual experience. For instance, \"moves backward\" could be specified as a \"backward dolly\" or \"tracking shot.\" The \"slightly unsteady\" quality likely comes from being handheld, which would introduce not just shakiness but also minor, erratic tilts and rolls that add to the scene's chaotic energy; mentioning this would be more descriptive. Given the setting of a long hall and the need to capture fast action, the video was probably shot on a wide-angle lens, which would create noticeable \"barrel distortion,\" making the straight lines of the walls appear to curve outwards and exaggerating the speed of the chase. The description of the focus is good, but could be more specific by stating that the subjects move in and out of a shallow, relatively fixed \"focus plane\" due to the camera operator's struggle to maintain a constant distance while running backward. Finally, the purpose of the truck right could be clarified; for example, the camera might truck right to keep both clowns in the frame as they begin to separate or to anticipate their movement toward a doorway on the right, adding a narrative layer to the camera's movement.",
