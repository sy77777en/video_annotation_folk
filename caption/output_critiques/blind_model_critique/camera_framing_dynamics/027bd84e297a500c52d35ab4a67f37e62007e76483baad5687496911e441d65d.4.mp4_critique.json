    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a ultra shallow focus with the foreground in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great example to work with. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but incomplete**. It is accurate in what it states and follows the instruction for conciseness, but it omits a key piece of information required by the instructions: camera height.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate.\n*   **\"static camera\"**: Correct. The camera does not move, pan, tilt, or zoom throughout the video.\n*   **\"at a level angle\"**: Correct. The camera is not looking down (high angle) or up (low angle) at the subject; it is positioned straight-on.\n*   **\"focusing with ultra shallow depth\"**: Correct. The subject (the nesting doll) is in sharp focus, while the background is heavily blurred. \"Ultra shallow\" is an appropriate descriptor for the degree of blur.\n*   **\"on a Russian nesting doll in the foreground\"**: Correct. The doll is the primary subject and is positioned in the foreground.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete based on the detailed instructions.\n*   **Missing Information**: The instructions explicitly ask for **camera height** to be described (e.g., *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level*). The video is shot from a very low position, just slightly above the surface the doll is on. This \"low-level\" or \"low height\" is a key part of the shot's configuration and was omitted.\n*   **What it got right**: It correctly omits details that are not present, such as video speed alterations, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the stylistic instructions but fails on one content requirement.\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption is perfectly concise, avoiding unnecessary phrases.\n*   **Terminology**: It uses the correct technical terms as requested (\"static,\" \"level angle,\" \"ultra shallow depth\").\n*   **Content Requirement**: It fails to include all the required descriptive elements, specifically the **camera height**.\n\n---\n\n### How to Improve the Caption\n\nTo make the caption fully compliant with the instructions, you simply need to add the missing information about the camera's height.\n\n**Original Caption:**\n> The video features a static camera at a level angle, focusing with ultra shallow depth on a Russian nesting doll in the foreground.\n\n**Improved Caption:**\n> The video features a static camera positioned at a **low height** and level angle, focusing with ultra-shallow depth of field on a Russian nesting doll in the foreground.\n\nThis revised version is now both accurate and complete according to the provided instructions.",
