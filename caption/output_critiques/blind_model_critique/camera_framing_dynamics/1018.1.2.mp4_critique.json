    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is factually correct in every detail:\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is not looking up or down at the scene, and it is positioned at a height that mimics a person standing and observing.\n*   **\"capturing the scene with deep focus and a large depth of field\"**: This is a key observation and is perfectly described. Both the man in the foreground and the kitchen details in the background are sharp and in focus, which defines a large depth of field (deep focus).\n*   **\"It smoothly moves to the right\"**: The camera performs a clean, horizontal translation to the right. The term \"smoothly\" correctly describes the quality of the motion. In technical terms, this is a **trucking** or **dolly right** movement.\n*   **\"transitioning from a man... to a view of a kitchen area\"**: This accurately describes the content of the shot and the purpose of the camera movement, which is to reveal the environment.\n*   **\"The movement is steady and fluid, with no shaking\"**: This is correct. The shot is professionally executed, likely on a slider or gimbal, resulting in a perfectly stable movement.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what isn't present.\n*   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly omitted as per the instructions.\n*   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height**: Both \"level angle\" and \"eye level\" are correctly identified.\n*   **Movements**: The caption thoroughly describes the movement's direction (\"to the right\"), steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"steady and fluid\"), and purpose (revealing the kitchen). It correctly identifies it as a single, simple movement.\n*   **Focus**: The \"deep focus\" and \"large depth of field\" are explicitly and accurately mentioned. Since the focus is static, there was no need to describe focus changes, which the caption correctly avoids.\n*   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions needed to be described.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions exceptionally well.\n*   **Conciseness**: The description is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon while remaining informative. It combines multiple observations into clear, readable sentences.\n*   **Omission of Negatives**: It perfectly follows the rule \"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\" This demonstrates a clear understanding of the instructions.\n*   **Descriptive Language**: It uses effective descriptors like \"smoothly,\" \"steady,\" and \"fluid\" that paint a clear picture of the camera's behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It is precise, comprehensive without being verbose, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the technical and narrative aspects of the shot. There are no corrections or improvements needed.",
