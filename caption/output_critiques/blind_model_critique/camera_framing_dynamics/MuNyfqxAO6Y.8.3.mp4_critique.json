    "pre_caption": "This is a very smooth, low-angle, ground-level shot of a green car. The camera uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. There is a minor camera movement, trucking slightly to the right while panning left, which keeps the car stationary within the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving left to right and panning right to left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed breakdown of the caption's quality based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions, demonstrating a strong understanding of cinematographic terminology and applying it with accuracy and conciseness.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n\n*   **\"very smooth\"**: The camera movement is perfectly fluid, with no shaking or jitter. This suggests the use of a professional tool like a slider or a gimbal.\n*   **\"low-angle, ground-level\"**: The camera is positioned very close to the ground and is angled upward at the car, which correctly defines it as both a ground-level and low-angle shot. This perspective makes the car appear more dominant and powerful.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp\"**: This is a correct observation. Both the car in the midground and the building/trees in the background are in sharp focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n*   **\"trucking slightly to the right while panning left\"**: This is the most impressive and accurate part of the description. The caption correctly identifies the two simultaneous movements: the camera's physical translation to the right (trucking) and its rotational compensation to the left (panning) to keep the subject centered. This is a sophisticated observation.\n*   **\"which keeps the car stationary within the frame\"**: This accurately describes the *purpose* and result of the combined camera movements. The parallax effect is created while the subject remains the central point of focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is complete according to the instructions, including all necessary information while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes the key features of the shot: camera angle, height, movement (type, steadiness, direction, and purpose), and focus.\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so its omission is correct per the instructions.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so its omission is correct.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so there is no Dutch angle to mention.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there is no rack focus or focus tracking to describe.\n\nThe caption successfully provides a comprehensive configuration of the shot without adding unnecessary details.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres perfectly to all aspects of the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into just three clear sentences.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses precise terms like \"trucking,\" \"panning,\" \"low-angle,\" and \"deep focus\" correctly.\n*   **Descriptive Language:** It effectively communicates the visual experience (\"very smooth,\" \"keeping the entire scene sharp\").\n*   **Movement Description:** It follows the instructions for describing complex movement by breaking down the simultaneous actions (trucking and panning) and explaining their purpose.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary response to the prompt. It is technically accurate, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly concise. It demonstrates a superior ability to analyze a video shot and describe it using the precise language of cinematography as requested.",
