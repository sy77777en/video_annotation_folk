    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves up first, pauses briefly, and then slightly pans left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the instructions provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt at describing the scene but contains a major inaccuracy regarding the focus and omits a key camera movement. While it correctly identifies the point-of-view and some of the motion, it fails to provide a complete and fully accurate description as required by the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **\"From the point-of-view of the man on the stretcher...\"**: **Accurate.** This correctly establishes the subjective perspective of the shot.\n*   **\"...the unsteady camera...\"**: **Accurate.** The camera movement is clearly shaky and unstable, effectively simulating the experience of being moved on a stretcher.\n*   **\"...starts at hip level and moves up to eye level.\"**: **Partially Accurate but Imprecise.**\n    *   The starting height is lower than \"hip level\" relative to the standing paramedics; it's more of a **low-angle** or chest-level view from the stretcher.\n    *   The movement is more of a **tilt up** or **crane up** (as the headrest is likely adjusted) rather than a simple vertical \"move up.\"\n*   **\"After a brief pause, it pans slightly to the left.\"**: **Accurate.** This movement is clearly visible.\n*   **\"The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**: **Highly Inaccurate.** This is the most significant error. The video clearly uses a **shallow depth of field**. The paramedic in the foreground is in focus, but the background (the other paramedic, the ceiling, and the hallway) is noticeably blurred.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Missing Movement:** The caption completely omits the primary camera movement: the continuous **forward dolly** as the stretcher is pushed through the hallway. This is a crucial part of the action.\n*   **Missing Angle Description:** The caption implies a low angle by describing the height change, but it never explicitly states that the shot begins from a **low angle**, which is a key component of the initial framing.\n*   **Focus Details:** The description of focus is not only inaccurate but also incomplete. A correct description would mention the **shallow depth of field** and specify that the **focus plane is on the foreground/midground** (the main paramedic).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, which is good. It correctly omits mentions of normal video speed, lack of lens distortion, and lack of a Dutch angle, as instructed.\n*   **Informativeness:** Due to the inaccuracies and omissions, the caption is not as informative as it should be. It misleads the viewer about the visual style (focus) and fails to describe the full range of motion.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it contains a critical error about the depth of field and omits the primary forward motion of the camera. It fails to meet the instruction's requirement for an accurate and informative description of the camera's configuration.\n\nA better, more accurate caption would be:\n\n**\"From a point-of-view on a stretcher, the unsteady camera starts at a low angle and dollies forward. It then tilts up, raising the view to eye-level for the reclined person. After a pause, the camera pans slightly left. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the foreground paramedic in focus while the background remains blurred.\"**",
