    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great test of the captioning instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption.\n\nThe caption is a good start and correctly identifies several key aspects, but it contains a significant inaccuracy and could be more precise.\n\n**Feedback on the Caption:**\n\n\"The video is shot from an eye-level height with a high angle, looking down. It features a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady.\"\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **High Angle:** This is accurate. The camera is positioned above the keyboard and angled downwards.\n    *   **Shallow Depth of Field:** This is perfectly described. The keyboard is in focus while the background is significantly blurred.\n    *   **Fixed but Slightly Unsteady:** This is an excellent and concise description of the camera's state. It correctly identifies that there is no intentional movement (panning, tilting, etc.), but the slight wobble indicates it is not on a tripod and is likely handheld.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Focusing on the foreground:** This is the main error. In this shot, the keyboard and hands are the **midground**. The foreground is the empty space between the camera lens and the laptop, which is out of focus. The background is the area behind the laptop, which is also out of focus. The focus plane is firmly on the midground.\n    *   **Eye-level height:** This is debatable and imprecise. While it could be interpreted as the eye-level of a person sitting down and looking at their laptop, a more accurate term would be **overhead-level**, as the camera is positioned directly above the subject (the keyboard).\n\n### Completeness\n\n*   The caption is commendably concise, as requested. It correctly omits details that are not present, such as altered video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angles, which follows the instructions perfectly.\n*   It successfully covers the most prominent features: angle, depth of field, and camera stability.\n*   It could have been slightly more complete by explicitly stating the focus is *static* (not changing), but \"focusing on the foreground\" implies this, even though the plane is wrong.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the instruction for conciseness.\n*   It uses the specified terminology (high angle, shallow depth of field).\n*   It fails on one key instruction: to accurately describe the **focus plane**. It identifies the depth of field but misidentifies the plane of focus as \"foreground\" instead of \"midground.\"\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies while maintaining conciseness, fully adhering to the instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from an overhead, high angle, the video uses a shallow depth of field to keep the midground keyboard in focus. The static camera is slightly unsteady, indicating a handheld shot.\"**",
