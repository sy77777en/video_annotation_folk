    "pre_caption": "Starting at hip level and moving down to ground level, the camera maintains a level angle. The shot is very smooth, with the camera constantly moving forward and downward while panning right. It begins by tilting down to reveal the tank traps on the ground, then subtly shifts left to move alongside them. A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the tank traps in the midground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera constantly moves forward and downward while panning right, starting with a tilt down to reveal more installations on the ground, followed by a subtle leftward movement to avoid them.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Evaluation Summary:**\n\nThe caption is partially successful. It correctly identifies several key aspects like the camera height change, smoothness, and focus. However, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's angle and movement, which misrepresent how the shot was executed.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy**\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The description \"Starting at hip level and moving down to ground level\" is accurate.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"The shot is very smooth\" is correct; the movement is fluid, suggesting a gimbal or similar stabilizer.\n    *   **Movement (Partial):** The description of the camera \"constantly moving forward and downward while panning right\" and \"tilting down to reveal the tank traps\" is accurate. These are the core movements in the shot.\n    *   **Focus:** \"A shallow depth of field keeps the focus on the tank traps in the midground\" is a perfect description of the video's focus and depth.\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The statement that the camera \"maintains a level angle\" is **incorrect**. The shot begins with a **high angle** (looking down at the ground) and transitions to a **level angle** as the camera approaches ground level. It does not *maintain* a single angle.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The phrase \"then subtly shifts left to move alongside them\" is **highly inaccurate**. The camera is **continuously panning right** throughout the entire shot. There is no leftward movement (trucking left). The visual effect of moving \"alongside\" the tank traps is created by the combination of the forward dolly and the right pan, but the camera itself never shifts left. This is a critical error in describing the camera's motion.\n\n#### **Completeness**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most prominent features required by the instructions: camera height, movement (though partially inaccurate), steadiness, and focus.\n*   It correctly follows the instruction to be concise by omitting details about regular video speed, the absence of lens distortion, and the lack of a Dutch angle.\n*   While it describes the component movements, it fails to accurately synthesize them, leading to the incorrect \"shifts left\" conclusion. A more complete description would accurately describe the *combination* of movements (e.g., a descending, forward dolly with a continuous right pan).\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions**\n\n*   The caption attempts to follow all instructions by describing height, angle, movement, and focus.\n*   It uses appropriate terminology like \"panning,\" \"tilting,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n*   However, its failure to provide an accurate description of the angle and a key part of the movement means it does not fully meet the core requirement of providing an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Is the caption good?**\n\n**No, the caption is not good.** While it has some correct elements, the significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's angle and movement make it a poor and misleading description of the shot. A good caption must be, above all, accurate.\n\n### **Improved Caption Example:**\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately reflects the video according to the instructions:\n\n\"The shot begins with the camera at hip-level, using a high angle to tilt down towards concrete tank traps. It then executes a very smooth, complex movement, simultaneously moving forward and descending to ground-level while continuously panning right. By the end of the shot, the camera is at a level angle with the ground. A shallow depth of field maintains sharp focus on the tank traps in the midground, blurring the background.\"",
