    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera remains stationary relative to the train, positioned from the side with noticeable shaking, while the train appears to truck left throughout the shot.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The caption is very good and captures most of the key visual elements, but it contains one significant inaccuracy in its technical description of the movement.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance based on your instructions:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the man in the foreground using a shallow depth of field. The camera remains stationary relative to the train, positioned from the side with noticeable shaking, while the train appears to truck left throughout the shot.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"eye level with a level angle\" is perfectly correct. The camera is not looking up or down at the subject.\n    *   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"focusing on the man in the foreground using a shallow depth of field\" is spot-on. The man is sharp while the background is clearly blurred.\n    *   **Steadiness & Relative Position:** \"The camera remains stationary relative to the train... with noticeable shaking\" is an excellent and precise observation. The camera itself isn't panning or tilting, but it is vibrating along with the vehicle.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Movement:** The phrase \"...while the train appears to truck left throughout the shot\" is technically incorrect. **Trucking** is a movement where the *camera itself* moves horizontally. In this video, the camera is static within the train car. It is the entire vehicle (the frame of reference) that is moving through the world. The *effect* is that the background scrolls past, but this is not a \"trucking\" shot.\n\n---\n\n#### **Completeness: Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers the most important aspects required by the instructions:\n    *   Camera Height & Angle\n    *   Focus & Depth of Field\n    *   Camera Steadiness (shaking)\n    *   Relative Camera Movement (stationary within the train)\n*   It correctly identifies that there are no changes in video speed, no significant lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, and therefore omits them for conciseness as instructed.\n*   The only area where it is incomplete is in providing a *correct* description of the perceived motion. It attempts to describe it but uses the wrong terminology.\n\n---\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions: Very Good**\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the goal of being \"concise yet informative.\"\n*   It correctly uses terminology from the instructions like \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n*   The primary failure in adherence is the misuse of the term \"trucking,\" which is a specific movement defined in the instructions. The instruction asks for a description of camera movements, and since the camera isn't moving, describing the train's motion with a camera-specific term is a misapplication.\n\n### Conclusion and Suggested Improvement\n\nThe caption is strong in its description of the static camera properties but falters in its technical description of the motion. The distinction between the camera moving and the subject's environment moving is a key technical detail.\n\nA more accurate and technically sound caption would be:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"Positioned at an eye-level, level angle, the camera maintains a static frame on a man inside a train, using a shallow depth of field to keep him in focus. The shot has noticeable, high-frequency shaking, and the background scenery scrolls from right to left due to the train's forward motion.\"",
