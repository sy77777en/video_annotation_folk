    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is out of focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward quickly, then stays static with noticeable shaking.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written and effective caption that closely follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is good, based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\nYes, the caption is good. It is accurate, concise, and correctly applies the rules and terminology outlined in the instructions. It successfully captures the most important technical and stylistic elements of the video.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it mentions:\n*   **\"From a level angle...\"**: Correct. The camera is not tilted up or down; it points straight ahead.\n*   **\"...the camera moves forward quickly...\"**: Correct. The video begins with a rapid, blurry forward motion (a fast dolly-in).\n*   **\"...before becoming static...\"**: Correct. After the initial push, the camera's position does not change for the rest of the shot.\n*   **\"...with noticeable shaking.\"**: Correct. The camera is unstable and wobbles significantly, especially after it comes to a rest. \"Noticeable\" is an appropriate descriptor.\n*   **\"The shot is out of focus...\"**: Correct. No part of the image is in sharp focus.\n*   **\"...and uses a shallow depth of field.\"**: Correct. The nature of the blur, where the background is heavily indistinct from the midground, is characteristic of a shallow depth of field, even though a specific focus plane was missed entirely.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\nThe caption is nearly complete, covering all the most relevant aspects while correctly omitting unnecessary information.\n\n*   **What it includes:** Camera angle, movement (translation, speed, steadiness), and focus (state and depth). These are the most prominent features of the shot.\n*   **What it omits (and why it's correct):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** It's regular speed, so per the instructions, it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n*   **Minor Point for Improvement:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** The instructions ask for camera height (e.g., eye-level, ground-level). The camera appears to be at **table-level** or **low-level**. Adding this would make the caption even more complete. For example: *\"From a low, level angle...\"*\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates an excellent understanding of the instructions' nuances.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is very concise, packing a lot of information into two short sentences without any filler words.\n*   **Omitting Negatives:** It perfectly follows the rule: \"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\" This shows a high level of adherence.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specific terminology requested, such as \"level angle,\" \"static,\" \"shaking,\" \"out of focus,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description of the movement (\"moves forward... before becoming static\") is presented in the correct temporal order.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is a high-quality example of what the instructions requested. It is accurate, informative, and concise. The only potential improvement would be to add a descriptor for the camera's height to achieve perfect completeness according to the prompt.",
