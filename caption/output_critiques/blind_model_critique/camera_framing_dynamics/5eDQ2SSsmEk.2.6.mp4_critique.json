    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at hip level, focused on a man eating in a car. It uses a shallow depth of field, concentrating on the midground. Initially, the camera is at a level angle, looking straight ahead, then transitions to a low angle as it zooms out and tilts up. The movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is zooming out and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is a good attempt, but it has some key inaccuracies and omissions when measured against the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the feedback:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the subject, the shallow depth of field, the focus on the midground, the initial level angle, the transition to a low angle, the upward tilt, and the unsteady nature of the camera.\n*   **Inaccurate - Camera Height:** \"Hip level\" is incorrect. The camera is inside a car, positioned at roughly the chest level or dashboard level of a seated person. \"Chest-level\" or \"seated eye-level\" would be more accurate.\n*   **Inaccurate - Camera Movement:** The caption states the camera \"zooms out.\" This is technically incorrect. A **zoom** involves changing the lens's focal length. In the video, the camera is physically moving backward, away from the subject. This movement is called a **dolly out** or **dollying backward**. While the effect is similar to a zoom, the instructions specifically ask for the correct technical term.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n\n*   **Good Coverage:** The caption covers many of the required elements: height, focus, angle, movement types (tilt), and steadiness.\n*   **Minor Omission:** It correctly omits video speed and lens distortion as they are standard/absent, following the instructions.\n*   **Key Omission:** While it mentions tilting and an incorrect zoom, it fails to identify the primary backward movement as a **dolly**. The full, complex movement is a combination of a dolly and a tilt.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\n*   **Good:** The caption is concise and avoids mentioning elements that are not present (like lens distortion or altered video speed), as instructed.\n*   **Needs Improvement:** It fails to use the precise terminology for camera movement (dolly vs. zoom), which was a specific point in the instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good but not great. It captures the general feel of the shot but falters on technical precision, specifically regarding camera height and the distinction between dollying and zooming.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n\"From a chest-level height and a level angle, the camera captures a man eating in a car, using a shallow depth of field to keep the midground in focus. The camera then simultaneously dollies backward and tilts upward, transitioning to a low angle. The handheld movement is slightly unsteady throughout the shot.\"",
