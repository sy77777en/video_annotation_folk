    "pre_caption": "This smooth, eye-level shot, captured with a level angle, maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera leads the blue car from the front, moving backward throughout the shot. At the end, it trucks left and pans right as another car appears on the right.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera keeps moving backward throughout the shot, then trucks left and pans right at the end.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the shot as smooth and having a level angle, several key details seem inaccurate or incomplete based on the visual information. The camera height is described as eye-level, but it appears to be a more dynamic low-angle shot, positioned closer to the ground to make the car feel more powerful and dominant in the frame. The most significant discrepancy is the focus; the video clearly utilizes a shallow depth of field, causing the background scenery to be artistically blurred and isolating the sharp, in-focus blue car, rather than the \"deep focus\" the caption claims. The initial movement is a dolly out, tracking backward in sync with the car. The final movement is more than a simple truck and pan; it's a coordinated counter-clockwise arc that swings the camera from the front of the blue car to its side. This maneuver's purpose is to perfectly reframe the composition to include the second car as it pulls alongside, creating a dynamic two-shot. The caption's statement that the second car \"appears on the right\" is also ambiguous; it enters from the left side of the frame to position itself on the blue car's right. Finally, the caption omits the presence of slight barrel distortion, suggesting a wide-angle lens was used to exaggerate the speed and proximity to the subject.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This dynamic low-angle shot, captured close to the ground, enhances the blue car's powerful presence in the frame. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, artistically blurring the background while keeping the blue car sharply in focus. Initially, the camera performs a dolly out, tracking backward in sync with the car. The final movement is a coordinated counter-clockwise arc, swinging from the front to the side of the blue car, perfectly reframing the composition to include a second car as it enters from the left and positions itself on the blue car's right. The use of a wide-angle lens introduces slight barrel distortion, exaggerating the speed and proximity to the subject.",
