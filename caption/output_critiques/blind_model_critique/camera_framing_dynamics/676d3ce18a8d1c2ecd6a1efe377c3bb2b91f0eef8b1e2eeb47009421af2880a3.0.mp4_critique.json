    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** but not perfect. It is accurate, clear, and captures the main visual elements of the video. However, it could be improved by incorporating more of the specific technical terminology requested in the instructions to achieve greater precision and completeness.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n\n*   **\"aerial view with a high angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is clearly positioned high above the ground (aerial) and looking down (high angle).\n*   **\"looking down at a church and its surroundings\"**: This accurately describes the subject and composition.\n*   **\"maintains a deep focus, capturing all elements sharply\"**: This is correct. The trees in the foreground, the church in the midground, and the distant buildings in the background are all in sharp focus.\n*   **\"moves smoothly from left to right\"**: This accurately describes the direction and quality of the camera movement.\n*   **\"minimal shaking\"**: This is also accurate; the shot is very stable, likely due to a gimbal on a drone.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **mostly complete** but misses a key technical term.\n\n*   **What it covers well:** It successfully identifies the camera height/angle, focus, and the general nature of the movement (direction, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   **What's missing:** The instructions ask for specific movement types like *trucking*. The phrase \"moves from left to right\" is a descriptive equivalent, but the technical term for a camera moving sideways through space is **trucking**. This is the most significant omission.\n*   **What it correctly omits:** Following the instructions, the caption correctly avoids mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all standard/absent in the video. This shows good adherence to the conciseness rule.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to the spirit of the instructions but could follow the letter more closely.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and informative, as requested.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the correct term \"deep focus.\" However, it fails to use the specific term **trucking** for the camera movement, opting for a more general description. The instructions explicitly list \"trucking\" as a desired term.\n*   **Height and Angle:** It correctly identifies \"aerial view\" and \"high angle.\" Using the specific term **aerial-level** from the instructions would be a minor improvement.\n*   **Movement Description:** It successfully describes the movement's steadiness (\"smoothly,\" \"minimal shaking\") and direction (\"left to right\"), which aligns well with the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised caption that more fully incorporates the specific terminology from your instructions, making it more precise and complete:\n\n**\"This aerial-level, high-angle shot features the camera smoothly trucking from left to right to reveal a church and its surroundings. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Uses \"aerial-level\"**: A specific term from the instructions for camera height.\n*   **Uses \"trucking\"**: The correct technical term for the camera's sideways movement, as requested.\n*   **Combines Information**: It integrates the movement and its purpose concisely, maintaining a good flow.\n*   **Maintains Accuracy and Conciseness**: It includes all necessary information without adding unnecessary words.",
