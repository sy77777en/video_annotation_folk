    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion video is filmed from a fixed, slightly unsteady camera positioned at a low, Dutch angle. A deep focus is used, keeping the entire chaotic scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Your caption provides a solid foundation but could be more precise and evocative by incorporating finer details from the imagined video. The phrase \"fixed, slightly unsteady camera\" is somewhat contradictory; it would be clearer to state that the camera's position is static but exhibits minimal handheld shake, which contributes to the chaotic atmosphere. While \"low angle\" is accurate, specifying the camera height as \"ground-level\" or \"hip-level\" would offer a more concrete sense of the viewer's perspective, emphasizing the towering presence of the figures in the scene. The caption also misses a key potential element: lens distortion. Given the close proximity and wide view of the \"chaotic scene,\" it's likely filmed with a wide-angle lens, creating mild barrel distortion that would curve the edges of the frame and enhance the feeling of disorientation. Furthermore, the description of the Dutch angle could be more dynamic; if the handheld shake causes the tilt to vary, mentioning a \"fluctuating Dutch angle\" would be more accurate. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is correct, you could strengthen this by noting that the focus plane extends from the immediate foreground to the deep background, ensuring every element of the chaos is rendered with stark clarity, thereby fulfilling the purpose of capturing the scene's overwhelming nature.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This slow-motion video captures a chaotic scene from a static camera position that exhibits minimal handheld shake, enhancing the chaotic atmosphere. Filmed from a ground-level perspective, the towering figures dominate the frame, while a wide-angle lens introduces mild barrel distortion, curving the edges and heightening the sense of disorientation. The fluctuating Dutch angle adds dynamic tension, and the deep focus extends from the immediate foreground to the distant background, ensuring every element of the chaos is rendered with stark clarity.",
