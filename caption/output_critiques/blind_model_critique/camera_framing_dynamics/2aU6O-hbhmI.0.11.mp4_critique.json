    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone captures the city at dusk, moving forward while adding a 90-degree left pan to adjust its facing. It then continues moving forward in its new direction.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres closely to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** *The video features noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward. The camera is at an aerial level with a level angle, incorporating a varying Dutch angle due to rolling. It maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. The drone smoothly captures the city at dusk, initially moving forward while executing a 90-degree left pan to adjust its direction, then continues forward in the new direction.*\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n\n*   **Lens Distortion:** \"Noticeable fisheye distortion, curving straight lines outward\" is a perfect description. The curvature of the horizon and the bending of buildings at the edges are classic signs of this.\n*   **Camera Configuration:**\n    *   **Height & Angle:** \"Aerial level with a level angle\" is correct. The camera is high above the city, looking forward rather than steeply down (which would be a high angle or bird's-eye view).\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** \"Varying Dutch angle due to rolling\" is a precise and insightful observation. The camera does roll slightly as it moves, causing the horizon to tilt back and forth.\n*   **Focus:** \"Maintains deep focus with a large depth of field\" is accurate. Everything from the foreground buildings to the distant horizon is sharp and clear.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the movement is flawless. It correctly identifies the sequence:\n    1.  Initial forward movement.\n    2.  A smooth \"90-degree left pan.\"\n    3.  Continued forward movement in the new direction.\n    The use of \"smoothly\" correctly describes the steadiness of the drone's gimbal.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested by the instructions while correctly omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included:** It covers lens distortion, camera height, camera angle, Dutch angle, focus/depth of field, and a detailed breakdown of the camera's complex movement (steadiness, type, direction, and sequence).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so per the instructions, this was correctly left out.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static (deep focus), so there are no rack focuses or focus tracking to mention.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding and application of the specific terminology and structure outlined in the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise yet packed with all the necessary technical details. It avoids unnecessary words.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the precise terms from the instructions, such as \"fisheye distortion,\" \"aerial level,\" \"level angle,\" \"Dutch angle,\" \"rolling,\" \"deep focus,\" \"depth of field,\" and \"pan.\"\n*   **Movement Description:** The description of the movement follows the instructions perfectly by detailing the type, direction, steadiness, and temporal order of the actions.\n*   **Clarity:** The caption is easy to understand, breaking down complex camera work into a clear, logical sequence.\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Refinement\n\nWhile the caption is already excellent, one tiny refinement could make it even more technically aligned with the provided list of terms:\n\n*   The instruction lists \"dollying\" for forward/backward movement. The caption uses \"moving forward.\" While \"moving forward\" is perfectly clear, using \"dollying forward\" would be a slightly more technical application of the provided vocabulary.\n\n**Revised Movement Sentence (for stricter adherence):**\n\"The drone smoothly captures the city at dusk, initially **dollying forward** while executing a 90-degree left pan to adjust its direction, then continues **dollying forward** in the new direction.\"\n\nHowever, this is a very minor point. The original phrasing is completely understandable and not incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is **accurate**, **complete**, and **adheres strictly** to the required format and terminology. It successfully translates the visual information of the video into a precise and informative technical description.",
