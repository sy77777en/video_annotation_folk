    "pre_caption": "This video is captured from a helmet-mounted camera, providing a high-angle view that lead-tracks the wingsuit flyer. As the flyer launches from the cliff, the camera moves backward and then continues smoothly downward and backward to match their descent. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and uses a deep focus, keeping both the flyer in the foreground and the rocky cliff face below in sharp detail. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is locked onto the person's helmet as they jump down a cliff, following their movement.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, mounted on the wingsuit flyer's helmet, lead-tracks them, initially moving backward as they launch off the cliff. As they descend, it smoothly moves downward and backward, keeping pace with their flight.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the helmet-mounted camera, mild barrel distortion, and deep focus, it could be significantly more precise and comprehensive. The description of the camera movement as \"backward\" and \"downward\" is too simplistic; it should be described as *tracking* the subject from behind and below, combining a continuous *dolly out* and *pedestal down* relative to the subject's trajectory. The caption also omits the crucial fact that the camera maintains a fixed *upward tilt* to achieve the low-angle perspective. Furthermore, it fails to specify the video speed, which is a critical detail for a high-action sequence; for instance, it could be real-time footage to convey the raw velocity, or it might incorporate a *slow-motion* segment as the flyer launches from the cliff for dramatic emphasis. The description of the flyer in the \"foreground\" is likely inaccurate; given the framing, the flyer would occupy the *midground*, with the rocky cliff face in the background and the foreground being empty air. Finally, the phrase \"creating the impression of\" is interpretive and should be replaced with a more direct description of the camera's configuration, such as stating the shot is captured from an *aerial-level* that is constantly decreasing in altitude.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video, captured from a helmet-mounted camera, offers a dynamic high-angle view that precisely tracks the wingsuit flyer. As the flyer launches from the cliff, the camera executes a continuous dolly out and pedestal down, tracking the subject from behind and below while maintaining a fixed upward tilt for a low-angle perspective. The footage exhibits mild barrel distortion and employs deep focus, keeping the flyer in the midground and the rocky cliff face in the background in sharp detail. The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking, and the video speed is real-time, capturing the raw velocity of the descent. The shot is captured from an aerial level that is constantly decreasing in altitude, enhancing the sense of motion and immersion.",
