    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is good. It is accurate, concise, and effectively follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes the key visual and technical elements of the video:\n*   **\"slow, smooth\"**: The camera's movement is indeed slow and very steady, likely achieved with a gimbal or stabilizer.\n*   **\"eye-level shot from a level angle\"**: The camera is positioned at the subject's head height and is not tilted up or down, making both descriptions correct.\n*   **\"moves forward slightly\"**: The camera is clearly moving forward, following the subject. \"Slightly\" correctly conveys the slow, deliberate pace of the movement.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: The background is visibly out of focus while the subject is sharp, which is the definition of a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"keeping the faceless figure in the foreground in sharp focus\"**: This correctly identifies the subject, its position in the frame, and the focus plane.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully covers the most critical aspects requested in the instructions without being overly verbose:\n*   **Camera Height and Angle**: Both \"eye-level\" and \"level angle\" are included.\n*   **Camera Movement**: The movement is described by its direction (\"forward\"), speed (\"slow\"), and steadiness (\"smooth\").\n*   **Focus**: It clearly states the depth of field (\"shallow\") and the focus plane (\"foreground\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions:\n*   **Conciseness**: It avoids mentioning elements that are not present, such as lens distortion, Dutch angles, or complex shot transitions, just as the instructions advise.\n*   **Clarity**: The description is easy to understand for both a technical and non-technical audience.\n*   **Informativeness**: Despite its brevity, it provides a comprehensive overview of the shot's configuration.\n\n### Minor Suggestions for Improvement\nWhile the caption is excellent, it could be made even more precise by incorporating more technical terms from the instructions:\n*   The movement \"moves forward\" could be specified as a **\"slow dolly forward\"** or **\"tracking shot.\"**\n*   The video appears to be in slight **slow-motion**, which could be mentioned at the beginning for added clarity (e.g., \"This slow-motion, eye-level shot...\").\n*   The phrase \"keeping the... figure... in sharp focus\" implies **focus tracking**, which could be stated explicitly.\n\nHowever, these are minor refinements. As written, the caption is a very good and effective description that fulfills all the core requirements of the prompt.",
