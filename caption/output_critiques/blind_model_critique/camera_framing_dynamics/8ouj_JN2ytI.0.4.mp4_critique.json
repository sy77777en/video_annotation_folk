    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Caption:** This eye-level, level-angle shot uses a shallow depth of field to keep the line of football players in the foreground in sharp focus, blurring the crowd behind them. The camera moves smoothly and slowly to the right, tracking along the line of players.\n\n---\n\n### Feedback:\n\nThe caption is **excellent** and serves as a perfect example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres to all specified rules.\n\n**1. Accuracy:**\n*   The caption accurately identifies all the key technical and visual aspects:\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** Correctly identifies the shot as `eye-level` and `level-angle`.\n    *   **Focus:** Precisely describes the `shallow depth of field`, correctly identifying the `foreground` (players) as the plane of focus and the background (crowd) as blurred.\n    *   **Movement:** Accurately describes the camera movement as smooth, slow, moving to the right, and `tracking` the subject.\n\n**2. Completeness:**\n*   The caption is comprehensive, covering all the relevant points required by the instructions for this specific video.\n    *   **Configuration:** It covers height, angle, focus, and movement.\n    *   **Movement Details:** It specifies the movement's steadiness (`smoothly`), speed (`slowly`), direction (`to the right`), and purpose (`tracking along the line of players`).\n    *   **Focus Details:** It specifies the depth (`shallow`) and the focus plane (`foreground`).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and effective. It avoids unnecessary words while providing all the critical information.\n*   **Omission of Defaults:** It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as per the instruction to only mention these if they are present or altered. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the rules.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and descriptive, making it easy for a reader to visualize the shot without ambiguity. It successfully combines technical terms (`shallow depth of field`, `tracking`) with simple descriptions (`moves... to the right`) for maximum clarity.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis caption is a model response. It perfectly balances being informative and concise, accurately captures all the necessary details, and strictly follows every rule outlined in the instructions. No improvements are needed.",
