    "pre_caption": "The video is shot at eye level with a low angle, looking up at the man in the midground. The camera is fixed with a slight unsteadiness and maintains a shallow depth of field, focusing on the man. The camera is also at a fixed Dutch angle throughout the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies several key technical aspects of the shot, such as the angle, depth of field, and Dutch angle. However, it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding camera height and uses a term for camera movement (\"fixed\") that is contradictory.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies the **low angle**, the **shallow depth of field** with focus on the man in the **midground**, and the presence of a **fixed Dutch angle**. These are all prominent features of the video.\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the camera height as **\"eye level\"** is incorrect. To achieve a low angle shot looking up at a standing subject, the camera must be positioned significantly lower than the subject's eye level. In this video, the camera appears to be at **hip-level or chest-level**. Stating it's at \"eye level\" directly contradicts the \"low angle\" description.\n*   **Imprecise:** The phrase **\"fixed with a slight unsteadiness\"** is contradictory. A \"fixed\" camera is stationary, typically on a tripod, and would not be unsteady. The movement seen in the video is characteristic of a **handheld** shot where the operator is trying to remain still. A more accurate description would be \"The handheld camera is mostly static but has slight, natural unsteadiness.\"\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **Very Good:** The caption is commendably complete according to the instructions. It covers all the relevant, non-standard attributes of the shot:\n    *   **Camera Angle:** Covered (low angle).\n    *   **Camera Height:** Covered (though inaccurately).\n    *   **Movement/Steadiness:** Covered (fixed with unsteadiness).\n    *   **Focus/Depth:** Covered (shallow depth of field, focus on man).\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** Covered.\n*   It correctly omits details that are standard, such as **regular video speed** and the **absence of lens distortion**, which adheres perfectly to the instruction to be concise and not mention normal attributes.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Good Adherence:** The caption follows most of the instructions well.\n    *   It is **concise**.\n    *   It uses specific terminology like \"low angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" and \"Dutch angle.\"\n    *   It correctly identifies the focus plane (\"midground\").\n    *   It correctly omits unnecessary information (video speed, lens distortion).\n*   **Area for Improvement:** The primary failure in adherence is the lack of precision in the chosen terms (\"eye level,\" \"fixed\"), which leads to the inaccuracies mentioned above. The instructions emphasize providing an \"informative description,\" and these inaccuracies detract from that goal.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies while adhering strictly to all instructions:\n\n**Shot from a low, hip-level angle, the handheld camera is mostly static but exhibits slight unsteadiness. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, keeping the man in the midground in focus, and features a consistent Dutch angle throughout.**",
