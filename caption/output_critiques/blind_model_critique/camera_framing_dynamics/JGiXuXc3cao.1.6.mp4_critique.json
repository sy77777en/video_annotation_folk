    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera continuously zooms out throughout the video, rolling clockwise from a Dutch angle to a level angle.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, concise, and effectively uses the specified terminology to describe the most prominent camera actions in the video. It successfully balances being informative with being brief.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**.\n\n*   **\"smoothly zooms out\"**: This is correct. The camera's field of view widens steadily and without any jitter, revealing more of the subject and his environment.\n*   **\"from an animated illustration of Robert Ballard\"**: This correctly identifies the subject and the medium (animation).\n*   **\"it also rolls clockwise\"**: This is a precise description of the rotational movement. The camera starts tilted to the left (a counter-clockwise tilt) and rotates clockwise to straighten out.\n*   **\"correcting from an initial Dutch angle to a level horizon\"**: This is an excellent and accurate description of both the starting state (Dutch angle) and the purpose/end state of the roll movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very good but could be slightly more complete by adding a few minor details. It correctly omits information as per the instructions (e.g., regular video speed, no lens distortion).\n\n**What it covers well:**\n*   **Movements:** It perfectly captures the two simultaneous movements (zoom and roll) and their purpose.\n*   **Steadiness:** The word \"smoothly\" effectively describes the steadiness.\n*   **Dutch Angle:** It correctly identifies and explains the Dutch angle.\n\n**What could be added for greater completeness:**\n*   **Camera Angle:** The caption correctly identifies the *Dutch angle* (roll axis), but it omits the primary vertical angle. The shot is filmed from a **low angle**, looking up at the character, which adds to his heroic or authoritative presence.\n*   **Focus/Depth of Field:** The video is a 2D animation and therefore has no realistic depth of field. All elements are in sharp focus. The instructions mention describing this if it appears artificial. A brief mention of \"flat focus\" or \"no realistic depth of field\" would make the description more exhaustive.\n*   **Camera Height:** While difficult to define precisely in an animation, it could be described relative to the subject (e.g., \"chest-level\"). However, omitting this for conciseness is a reasonable choice.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres to the instructions **exceptionally well**.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of accurate information into a single, easy-to-read sentence.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specified terms \"zooms out,\" \"rolls clockwise,\" and \"Dutch angle\" perfectly.\n*   **Omission of Redundant Info:** It correctly follows the rule to not mention regular video speed, the absence of lens distortion, or the absence of a Dutch angle (by instead describing its presence and correction).\n*   **Describes Movement Purpose:** It clearly states the purpose of the roll is to \"correct\" the initial tilt, which is a high-level detail the instructions encourage.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nTo make the caption perfect according to the instructions, you could integrate the missing \"low angle\" detail. Here are two slightly revised options:\n\n**Option 1 (Slightly more detailed):**\n> From a low angle, the camera smoothly zooms out from an animated illustration of Robert Ballard. As it zooms, it also rolls clockwise, correcting from an initial Dutch angle to a level horizon in this shot with a flat focus.\n\n**Option 2 (Maintaining maximum conciseness):**\n> From a low, Dutch angle, the camera smoothly zooms out and rolls clockwise to a level horizon, revealing an animated illustration of Robert Ballard.\n\nThis second option is particularly strong as it integrates the \"low angle\" and \"Dutch angle\" descriptions very efficiently at the beginning of the sentence.",
