    "pre_caption": "This underwater, high-angle shot tracks a sea turtle from the side, moving from left to right. As the turtle swims, the camera also moves forward and pans slightly left to keep it in frame. The camera movement is slightly unsteady, and a deep focus keeps both the turtle and the surrounding coral reef sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera side-tracks the sea turtle from left to right. As the turtle swims, it also moves forward while slightly panning left to maintain focus.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is moving rightward to track the subject from the side.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for the video. It is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption accurately describes a plausible and common type of underwater wildlife shot.\n*   **\"underwater, high-angle shot\"**: Correctly identifies both the environment (height) and the camera's perspective relative to the subject.\n*   **\"tracks a sea turtle from the side, moving from left to right\"**: Accurately describes the primary camera movement (tracking) and its direction.\n*   **\"camera also moves forward and pans slightly left to keep it in frame\"**: This shows a sophisticated understanding of camera work. A simple track might lose the subject. The combination of moving forward (dollying) and panning demonstrates a dynamic adjustment to maintain framing, which is very realistic.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady\"**: This is a precise and common characteristic of handheld or non-gyrostabilized underwater filming.\n*   **\"deep focus\"**: Correctly identifies that both the subject (turtle) and the background (coral reef) are in focus, which is typical for this type of shot where the environment is as important as the subject.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary elements mandated by the instructions for a single, continuous shot.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle**: Covered with \"underwater, high-angle.\"\n*   **Movements**: It details multiple simultaneous movements: **tracking** (following the subject), **trucking** (\"moving from left to right\"), **dollying** (\"moves forward\"), and **panning**. It also describes the **steadiness** (\"slightly unsteady\") and the **purpose** (\"to keep it in frame\").\n*   **Focus**: It clearly defines the depth of field (\"deep focus\") and what is in the focus plane (\"both the turtle and the surrounding coral reef sharp\").\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption demonstrates a perfect understanding of the instructions' nuances.\n*   **Conciseness**: It is concise and avoids jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"moving from left to right\" instead of \"trucking right,\" which is perfectly acceptable). It packs a lot of information into two clear sentences.\n*   **Omission of Negatives**: As instructed, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, implying they are all standard/absent. This is a key part of creating a concise description.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It uses the correct technical terms (**high-angle, tracks, pans, deep focus**) exactly as the instructions intended.\n*   **Descriptive Detail**: It goes beyond a simple description by explaining the *relationship* between movements (panning *to keep the subject in frame*), which adds significant value and demonstrates a high level of observational skill.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This underwater, high-angle shot follows a sea turtle from the side as it swims left to right. The camera moves forward and pans slightly left to maintain the turtle in frame, with a slight unsteadiness typical of underwater filming. A deep focus ensures both the turtle and the surrounding coral reef remain sharp.",
