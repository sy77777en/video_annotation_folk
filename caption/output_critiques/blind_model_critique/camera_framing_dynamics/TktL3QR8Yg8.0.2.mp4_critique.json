    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is arcing clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is very good and adheres well to the instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"This is a ground-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field focused on the person's hands in the midground. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around the person as they draw on the floor.\"\n\n---\n\n### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it mentions:\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** \"Ground-level, level-angle\" is a perfect description. The camera is positioned very low to the floor and is aimed parallel to it.\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** \"Shallow depth of field focused on the person's hands in the midground\" is precise. The background is visibly blurred, the primary point of focus is clearly the hands and the charcoal, and this action is happening in the middle ground of the frame.\n*   **Camera Movement:** \"The camera smoothly arcs clockwise\" is an excellent and concise description of the movement. The camera is not just panning or trucking but moving in a circular path (\"arcing\") around the subject. The movement is fluid (\"smoothly\") and in a clockwise direction.\n\n### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete but has one minor area for improvement based on the detailed instructions.\n\n**What it does well:**\n*   It correctly identifies and describes all the most prominent and non-standard features of the shot: the low height/angle, the shallow DoF, and the complex arcing movement.\n*   It correctly omits details that are standard or absent, as per the instructions. There is no need to mention:\n    *   **Video Speed:** It is at a regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level.\n\n**Minor Omission:**\n*   **Focus Changes:** The instructions ask to note if there is *focus tracking*. As the camera arcs around the subject, the distance between the lens and the hands changes. To keep the hands perfectly in focus, the camera operator must be performing **focus tracking**. While the current description is not wrong, adding this detail would make it even more complete and technically precise.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness:** It is concise and packs a lot of information into two clear sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology correctly (e.g., \"ground-level,\" \"level-angle,\" \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground\").\n*   **Structure:** It logically groups the camera's static configuration (height, angle, focus) first, followed by its movement, which is easy to follow.\n*   **Omitting Defaults:** It successfully follows the rule of not mentioning standard attributes, which is key to creating an efficient and informative description.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, concise, and follows the instructions almost perfectly. It successfully captures the essential cinematic qualities of the shot. The only potential improvement would be to explicitly mention the focus tracking that accompanies the camera's arc.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Version for Perfection\n\nTo make the caption 100% compliant with the most detailed aspects of the instructions, you could revise it slightly:\n\n**\"This is a ground-level, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly arcs clockwise around a person drawing on the floor, with the focus tracking to keep their hands sharp in the midground.\"**\n\nThis version explicitly adds the \"focus tracking\" detail, making it a more technically complete description of the camera's operation during the movement. However, the original caption is already of very high quality.",
