    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a fixed dutch angle during the video.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is very good and accurately captures the key visual characteristics of the video according to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Caption:** \"The video is shot at eye level with a level angle and a fixed Dutch angle. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves forward, slightly unsteady with some shaking, focusing on the people walking down the stairs.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is highly accurate in its descriptions.\n*   **\"shot at eye level with a level angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is held at a height and angle consistent with a person's natural point of view while walking down stairs.\n*   **\"a fixed Dutch angle\"**: **Correct.** This is a key feature of the shot. The frame is noticeably tilted to the right throughout the entire video, and the tilt does not change.\n*   **\"deep focus with a large depth of field\"**: **Correct.** The people in the midground and the landing at the bottom of the stairs (background) are both reasonably sharp, indicating a large depth of field rather than a shallow one.\n*   **\"camera moves forward\"**: **Correct.** The primary movement is a forward dolly down the staircase.\n*   **\"slightly unsteady with some shaking\"**: **Correct.** The movement is not stabilized; it has the natural, minor shaking and bobbing of a handheld camera operated by someone who is walking.\n*   **\"focusing on the people walking down the stairs\"**: **Correct.** This accurately identifies the main subject and the purpose of the camera's attention.\n\n#### 2. Completeness: Very Good\nThe caption successfully includes the most important elements required by the instructions while correctly omitting unnecessary information.\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes camera height, angle, Dutch angle, focus/depth of field, and the primary camera movement and its quality (steadiness).\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at a regular speed, so omitting this detail follows the instruction for conciseness.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no significant lens distortion, so it was correct to not mention it.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\nThe only minor area for improvement would be to use more specific terminology for the movement, as suggested in the instructions. For example, \"moves forward\" could be specified as \"dollying forward,\" and the \"unsteadiness\" could be attributed to the natural pedestal (up-down) and truck (side-to-side) motions of walking. However, the current description is perfectly clear and effective.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption adheres remarkably well to the detailed instructions.\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a lot of accurate information into two clear sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Covers Key Configurations:** It addresses all the relevant aspects of the shot (angle, height, movement, focus, etc.).\n*   **Follows Omission Rules:** It correctly leaves out details for normal-speed playback and the absence of distortion, demonstrating a good understanding of the conciseness rule.\n*   **Describes Movement and Purpose:** It clearly states the direction of movement, its unsteady nature, and its purpose (focusing on the people).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is accurate, concise, and follows the provided instructions almost perfectly. It successfully identifies and communicates the most salient technical and stylistic features of the video.\n\nTo make it \"perfect\" based on the most granular details of the instructions, you could slightly revise it like this:\n\n**Slightly More Technical Version (for comparison):**\n\"Shot from an **eye-level** perspective with a **fixed Dutch angle**, the camera **dollies forward** down a staircase. The movement has a natural, **unsteady** quality from being handheld while walking. The shot maintains a **deep focus**, keeping the people in the midground and the background sharp.\"",
