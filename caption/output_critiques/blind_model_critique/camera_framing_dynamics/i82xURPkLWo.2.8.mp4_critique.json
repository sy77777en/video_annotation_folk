    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This feedback is based on the video I have just watched.\n\nThe caption contains a significant contradiction by describing the shot as both \"overhead\" and from a \"level angle.\" The video clearly shows a **high-angle shot**, as the camera is positioned significantly above the bridge and angled downwards, not parallel to the ground. While the description of the height is helpful, calling it a high-angle shot would be more accurate and less confusing. Furthermore, labeling the shot as purely \"static\" is an oversimplification. Over the course of the video, there is a very slow, subtle **dolly-in** movement toward the person on the bridge, a deliberate choice that gradually tightens the frame and draws the viewer's focus to the human element within the vast landscape. The caption also omits that the wide-angle lens used creates a noticeable **barrel distortion**, causing the straight railings of the bridge to appear slightly curved near the edges of the frame. Finally, a crucial element is missed: the clouds are moving unnaturally fast, and the water below the bridge has a smooth, ethereal quality, indicating the video is a **time-lapse**, not a real-time recording. While the deep focus is correctly identified, the caption would be far more accurate if it corrected the camera angle, acknowledged the subtle dolly movement, and mentioned both the lens distortion and the time-lapse effect.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This is a high-angle shot taken from a height approximately at the level of a second floor, with the camera angled downward. The video features a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape and the person on the bridge sharp and clear. There is a subtle dolly-in movement toward the person on the bridge, gradually tightening the frame and drawing attention to the human element. The wide-angle lens used creates a noticeable barrel distortion, causing the straight railings of the bridge to appear slightly curved near the edges.
