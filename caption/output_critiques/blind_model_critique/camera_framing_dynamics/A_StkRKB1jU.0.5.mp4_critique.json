    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, level angle inside a moving vehicle, the camera is fixed to the side of the car, smoothly tracking to the right. The shot utilizes a shallow depth of field, focusing on the upper body of the person in the front passenger seat, while the driver and the background remain out of focus.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, fixed to the side of the car, follows its movement to the right while focusing on the upper body of the person sitting in the front row.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nOverall, the caption is good but contains one significant inaccuracy regarding the camera's movement. It successfully captures several key aspects of the shot but misinterprets the primary motion.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Accuracy**\n\n*   **Mostly Accurate:** The description of the camera's position, angle, and focus is highly accurate.\n    *   `From an eye-level, level angle inside a moving vehicle...`: **Correct.** The camera is positioned at roughly the head height of the passengers and is not tilted up, down, or sideways.\n    *   `...the camera is fixed to the side of the car...`: **Correct.** The movement is perfectly smooth and stable, indicating a fixed mount rather than being handheld.\n    *   `The shot utilizes a shallow depth of field...`: **Correct.** This is a key feature of the video.\n    *   `...focusing on the upper body of the person in the front passenger seat, while the driver and the background remain out of focus.`: **Correct.** This perfectly describes the focus plane and what is blurred.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:** The description of the camera movement is incorrect.\n    *   `...smoothly tracking to the right.`: **Incorrect.** \"Tracking\" (or trucking/dollying sideways) means the camera itself is moving horizontally to the right. In this video, the camera is fixed inside the car and is moving **forward** along with the vehicle. The *visual effect* is that the background scenery appears to slide from left to right across the frame, but this is a result of forward motion, not lateral camera movement. A more accurate description would be that the camera is **moving forward with the vehicle**.\n\n### **2. Completeness**\n\n*   The caption is quite complete, covering the most important visual elements as required by the instructions.\n*   It correctly identifies and describes **camera height, angle, steadiness (\"smoothly\"), and focus/depth of field**.\n*   Following the instructions, it correctly omits details about **video speed** and **lens distortion** because they are standard/not present.\n*   The primary gap in completeness is the lack of an accurate description of the camera's **primary movement (forward motion)**.\n\n### **3. Adherence to Instructions**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and well-written.\n*   **Terminology:** It correctly uses terms like \"eye-level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"shallow depth of field.\" However, it misuses the term \"tracking,\" which is a key technical term defined in the instructions. The instruction defines tracking as \"following a subject,\" which is not what is happening here; the camera is fixed relative to its immediate subjects (the passengers).\n*   **Structure:** The caption is well-structured, first establishing the camera's setup and then describing the focus.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Revised Caption**\n\nThe caption is strong in its description of the shot's composition and focus but fails on the critical point of camera movement. The term \"tracking to the right\" describes a visual artifact of the background, not the actual motion of the camera, which is a crucial distinction according to the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately reflects the video based on your instructions:\n\n**Revised Caption:**\n\"From an eye-level, level angle, a camera fixed inside a moving vehicle moves forward smoothly. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, with the focus held on the passenger in the foreground, while the driver and the passing background scenery remain out of focus.\"",
