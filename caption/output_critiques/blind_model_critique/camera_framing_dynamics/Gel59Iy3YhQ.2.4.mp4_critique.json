    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts up and pans left at first. After a slight forward movement, it pans right and tilts down, ending with another slight forward movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is good but has one significant flaw regarding its description of the camera's perspective.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **Accurate:**\n    *   **\"Slightly unsteady\"**: Correct. The shot is handheld and has a natural, minor wobble.\n    *   **\"high-angle shot\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned high up on a balcony, looking down at the ground and surrounding area.\n    *   **\"deep focus\"**: Correct. The foreground (balcony railing), midground (trees), and background (distant buildings) are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **Movement Description**: The sequence of movements—\"tilts up and pans left,\" \"moves slightly forward,\" \"pans right and tilts down to follow the wooden balcony,\" and the final \"slight forward movement\"—is described perfectly and in the correct order.\n\n*   **Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"...captured from an eye-level perspective\"**: This is contradictory and confusing. A shot cannot simultaneously be \"high-angle\" and \"eye-level\" in relation to the main scene. The instruction asks for height relative to the ground (e.g., ground-level, eye-level, overhead). While the camera is likely held at the operator's eye level, its position on a high balcony makes the overall shot high-angle and its height \"elevated\" or \"high-level,\" not \"eye-level\" with the ground below.\n\n**Completeness: Excellent**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects present in the video as required by the instructions:\n    *   **Steadiness**: \"slightly unsteady\"\n    *   **Camera Angle**: \"high-angle\"\n    *   **Camera Height**: Attempted with \"eye-level,\" though inaccurately.\n    *   **Movements**: A detailed and chronologically correct description of pans, tilts, and forward movements is provided.\n    *   **Focus**: \"deep focus\"\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, adhering to the instruction for conciseness. There is no mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or a **Dutch angle** because the video is at normal speed, has no discernible distortion, and the horizon is level.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Good**\n\n*   **Conciseness**: The caption is concise while remaining informative, as requested.\n*   **Descriptive Language**: It uses clear and appropriate terms like \"tilts,\" \"pans,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Structure**: It correctly describes the camera's static properties first (steadiness, angle, focus) and then details the movements in temporal order.\n*   **Main Failure**: The primary failure in adherence is the inaccurate and contradictory description of the camera's height/perspective (\"high-angle\" vs. \"eye-level\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good at describing the camera's movement and focus. Its main weakness is the confusing and contradictory description of the camera's height and angle. By stating the shot is both \"high-angle\" and \"eye-level,\" it creates a logical inconsistency.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised version that corrects the error while maintaining the strengths of the original:\n\n**\"This slightly unsteady, high-angle shot is captured from an elevated position with deep focus. The camera first tilts up and pans left, followed by a slight dolly forward. It then pans right and tilts down to trace the line of the wooden balcony, concluding with another subtle forward movement.\"**\n\nThis version resolves the contradiction by using \"elevated position\" instead of \"eye-level perspective,\" which accurately reflects the camera's height relative to the scene. It also uses the more technical term \"dolly forward\" for \"moves forward,\" though both are acceptable.",
