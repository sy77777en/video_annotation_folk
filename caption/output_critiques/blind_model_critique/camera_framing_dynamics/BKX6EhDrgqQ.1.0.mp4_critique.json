    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera starts at a high angle and smoothly moves forward and down to approach a person looking at a large screen, with an almost negligible pan to the left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** \"This high-angle, eye-level shot uses a shallow depth of field to focus on the person in the foreground. The camera moves smoothly forward and down, approaching the person as they stand in front of a large screen.\"\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe caption is partially accurate but contains a significant error that makes it confusing and technically incorrect.\n\n#### **Accuracy: Partially Accurate**\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"high-angle\"**: Correct. The camera starts positioned above the subject, looking down.\n    *   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The background is clearly blurred, isolating the person who is in focus.\n    *   **\"focus on the person in the foreground\"**: Correct. The person is the sharp focal point.\n    *   **\"camera moves smoothly forward and down\"**: Correct. This accurately describes the camera's motion (a combination of dollying in and craning/pedestaling down).\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"eye-level shot\"**: This is incorrect and contradicts the term \"high-angle.\" An **eye-level shot** is filmed from the subject's eye height with a level angle. A **high-angle shot** is filmed from above the subject. A shot cannot be both simultaneously. While the camera moves *towards* the subject's eye level, it doesn't start there, and labeling the entire shot as \"eye-level\" is misleading.\n\n#### **Completeness: Mostly Complete**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers several key aspects required by the instructions:\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"high-angle\"\n    *   **Focus/Depth of Field:** \"shallow depth of field,\" \"focus on the person\"\n    *   **Movement:** \"moves smoothly forward and down\"\n*   It correctly omits details for standard configurations (regular video speed, no lens distortion), which adheres to the conciseness instruction.\n*   **Minor Omission:** It could have been slightly more detailed by noting that the focus is maintained on the person as the camera moves closer (a form of focus tracking), but its absence doesn't detract significantly from the overall description.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions: Good, but Flawed**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon.\n*   **Informativeness:** The caption aims to be informative but fails on a key point. The contradictory description of the camera's position (\"high-angle, eye-level\") undermines its reliability and clarity. The instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative description,\" and providing misinformation is a critical failure.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because of the major inaccuracy in describing the camera's position. The contradictory phrase \"high-angle, eye-level shot\" makes the description confusing and demonstrates a misunderstanding of fundamental cinematography terms.\n\nA better caption would be:\n\n**\"This high-angle shot begins with a shallow depth of field focused on the person in the foreground. The camera cranes smoothly down and forward, moving from a high position toward the subject's eye level.\"**",
