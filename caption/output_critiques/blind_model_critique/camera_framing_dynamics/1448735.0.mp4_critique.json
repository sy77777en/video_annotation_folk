    "pre_caption": "The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain, where the ground is higher on the right side of the frame and lower on the left. Relative to the lower ground on the left, the camera is at eye level, while relative to the higher ground on the right, it is at ground level. The camera angle is level, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the forest in detail. The camera moves forward smoothly, maintaining steadiness without any shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain, where the ground is higher on the right side of the frame and lower on the left. Relative to the lower ground on the left, the camera is at eye level, while relative to the higher ground on the right, it is at ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great request for detailed analysis. Here is a thorough breakdown of the provided caption.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **not good**. While it correctly identifies some aspects of the video (deep focus, smooth forward movement), it fails significantly in adhering to the core instructions. It is inaccurate in its description of camera height, includes irrelevant information about the landscape, and misses the instruction's emphasis on conciseness and technical precision.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Partially Accurate:** The caption correctly identifies that the camera has a **deep focus/large depth of field** and that it **moves forward smoothly** without shaking. It also correctly states the **camera angle is level**.\n*   **Inaccurate/Misleading:** The description of the camera height is the biggest flaw.\n    *   `\"Relative to the lower ground on the left, the camera is at eye level, while relative to the higher ground on the right, it is at ground level.\"`\n    *   This is a confusing and incorrect way to describe camera height. Camera height is measured from the camera's position relative to a consistent plane, not by comparing it to every undulation in the terrain. The camera maintains a consistent **eye-level** height throughout the shot. Describing it as \"ground level\" on one side implies the camera is moving vertically, which it is not. This description of the terrain itself is also irrelevant to the camera's configuration.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is incomplete because it misses several key descriptive points requested by the instructions, while adding unnecessary ones.\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Movement Terminology:** It says the camera \"moves forward\" but fails to use the more precise technical term **dolly**.\n    *   **Movement Speed:** It mentions the movement is \"smooth\" but doesn't describe its **speed** (e.g., \"moderate and consistent speed\").\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement, which in this case is to create an immersive, first-person perspective of moving through the forest. This is omitted.\n\n*   **What's Unnecessarily Included:**\n    *   `\"The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain, where the ground is higher on the right side of the frame and lower on the left.\"`\n    *   This is a description of the **setting**, not the **camera's configuration**. The instructions specifically ask for a description of the camera's setup and movement.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption fails to follow several core principles of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The instruction states, \"Provide a concise yet informative description.\" The caption is not concise. It uses 32 words to give a confusing and irrelevant description of the terrain and camera height, when a simple phrase like \"The camera is at eye-level\" would have been accurate and sufficient.\n*   **Focus on Configuration:** The caption deviates from describing the **camera's configuration** and instead describes the **geography of the scene**.\n*   **Omission of Standard Features:** The caption correctly adheres to the rule of not mentioning regular video speed or the absence of lens distortion. This is the one area where it follows the instructions well.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that accurately follows all the given instructions:\n\n**\"Filmed from a steady, eye-level camera at a level angle, the shot dollies forward at a moderate and consistent speed to immerse the viewer in the environment. A deep focus keeps the entire forest scene, from the foreground to the background, sharply detailed.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Accurate & Concise:** It correctly identifies the height as **eye-level** and the angle as **level** in a single, efficient phrase.\n*   **Technically Precise:** It uses the correct term **\"dollies forward\"** and describes the **speed** (\"moderate and consistent\").\n*   **Follows Instructions:** It includes the **purpose** of the movement (\"to immerse the viewer\").\n*   **Relevant:** It focuses exclusively on the camera's configuration and its resulting visual effect (deep focus), without adding irrelevant details about the landscape.",
