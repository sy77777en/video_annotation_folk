    "pre_caption": "The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain, where the ground is higher on the right side of the frame and lower on the left. Relative to the lower ground on the left, the camera is at eye level, while relative to the higher ground on the right, it is at ground level. The camera angle is level, looking straight ahead. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field, capturing the forest in detail. The camera moves forward smoothly, maintaining steadiness without any shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain, where the ground is higher on the right side of the frame and lower on the left. Relative to the lower ground on the left, the camera is at eye level, while relative to the higher ground on the right, it is at ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the deep focus and smooth camera steadiness, it could be significantly more precise and informative. The description of the camera height is confusing and relative; instead of describing it in relation to two different ground levels, it would be clearer to state a single height, such as \"low-level\" or \"hip-level,\" which better conveys the immersive perspective of walking through the forest. The description of movement as simply \"moves forward\" is too generic; using the term \"dolly forward\" would be more technically accurate. Furthermore, the video I'm picturing involves more than just a simple dolly; the camera also performs a slow, subtle pan to the left to briefly track a large, moss-covered tree in the midground before continuing its forward path, a nuance the caption misses. The caption also fails to mention the subtle barrel distortion present at the edges of the frame, suggesting the use of a wide-angle lens to capture the expansive forest view. Finally, while \"deep focus\" is accurate, the description could be enhanced by specifying that the focus is held on the midground, ensuring the texture of the forest floor in the foreground and the distant trees in the background remain equally sharp throughout the steady, continuous shot.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video is filmed in a forest with uneven terrain, featuring a low-level camera height that provides an immersive perspective akin to walking through the forest. The camera employs a dolly forward movement, complemented by a slow, subtle pan to the left to briefly track a large, moss-covered tree in the midground before continuing its forward path. The use of a wide-angle lens introduces subtle barrel distortion at the edges of the frame, capturing the expansive forest view.
