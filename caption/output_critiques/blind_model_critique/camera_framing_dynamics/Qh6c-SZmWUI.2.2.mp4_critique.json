    "pre_caption": "The video begins inside a building at eye level, with the camera at a level angle. As the drone camera moves backward and exits, it transitions to an aerial level, revealing a large building on a mountain near the ocean. The camera maintains deep focus with a large depth of field. During the smooth backward flight, it gently rolls clockwise, creating a dynamic effect with a varying Dutch angle. The movement is very smooth, with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The video begins with a shot from inside a building at eye level. As the camera moves backward and exits the building, it transitions to an extreme wide shot, with the camera height shifting to aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone camera flies smoothly backward, revealing a large building perched on a mountain near the ocean. During the flight, it gently rolls clockwise, creating a visually dynamic and engaging effect.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on the caption. It is highly accurate and follows the instructions well. Here is a detailed breakdown of its strengths and one minor area for improvement.\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Starting Point:** \"inside a building at eye level, with the camera at a level angle\" is a perfect description of the initial shot.\n*   **Movement & Reveal:** \"moves backward and exits,\" \"transitions to an aerial level,\" and \"revealing a large building on a mountain near the ocean\" are all factually correct.\n*   **Focus:** \"maintains deep focus with a large depth of field\" is spot-on. Every element from the foreground architecture to the distant ocean is sharp.\n*   **Rotation & Effect:** \"gently rolls clockwise, creating a dynamic effect with a varying Dutch angle\" is a precise and sophisticated observation. This is the most complex movement in the shot, and you identified it perfectly.\n*   **Steadiness:** \"The movement is very smooth, with no shaking\" is accurate. The shot is clearly stabilized, likely by a drone with a gimbal.\n\n**Completeness: Very Good**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers most of the required elements: camera height, angle, movement (translation and rotation), steadiness, and focus.\n*   The one missing detail is a component of the translational movement. As the camera moves backward (dollies out), it also moves **upward** (pedestals or cranes up). This vertical ascent is what allows it to transition from \"eye level\" to \"aerial level.\" Mentioning this would make the description of the movement more complete.\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon while still being informative.\n*   **Selectivity:** You correctly omitted details about video speed (which is normal) and lens distortion (which is absent), as instructed.\n*   **Terminology:** You used correct terminology like \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"aerial level,\" \"deep focus,\" \"rolls clockwise,\" and \"Dutch angle.\"\n*   **Structure:** The description follows the temporal order of events in the video, which is logical and easy to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is very good and almost perfect. Its only minor shortcoming is not explicitly stating the upward vertical movement that accompanies the backward dolly.\n\n### Revised Caption for Improvement\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the missing detail for a more complete description:\n\n**\"The video begins inside a building at eye level with a level angle. The drone camera then simultaneously dollies backward and pedestals upward, transitioning to an aerial level that reveals a large building on a mountain by the ocean. Throughout this very smooth movement, the camera also performs a gentle clockwise roll, creating a varying Dutch angle. The shot maintains deep focus with a large depth of field.\"**",
