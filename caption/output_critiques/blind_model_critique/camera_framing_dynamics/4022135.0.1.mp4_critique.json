    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera intermittently pans right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and the detailed instructions, the provided caption is **not good**. It contains a significant factual error and omits a critical piece of information required by the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its failings and successes:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Poor**\n\n*   **Incorrect:** The caption states the camera is at a **\"level angle.\"** This is factually wrong. The camera is positioned high up in the stadium, looking down on the field and the crowd, which is a **high angle**.\n*   **Correct:** The description of the focus as **\"deep focus, keeping the entire football stadium sharp\"** is accurate. All elements from the near stands to the far side of the field are in focus.\n*   **Correct:** The description of the camera movement as a **\"smooth, intermittent pan to the right\"** is accurate. The camera rotates horizontally, pauses, and then continues, which is well-described as \"intermittent.\"\n\n**2. Completeness: Poor**\n\n*   **Major Omission:** The caption completely fails to mention that the video is a **time-lapse**. The rapidly moving clouds are the most obvious indicator of altered video speed. The instructions explicitly state, \"If video speed is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse*.\" This is the most significant omission.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The caption does not describe the **camera height** (e.g., \"high up in the stands\" or \"overhead-level\"), which is another specific requirement of the instructions.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Poor**\n\n*   The caption **fails** to follow the instruction to report altered **video speed**.\n*   The caption **fails** to correctly identify the **camera angle** as instructed.\n*   The caption **fails** to include the **camera height** as instructed.\n*   The caption **succeeds** in describing the camera movement and focus as instructed.\n*   The caption **succeeds** in being concise and correctly omitting details about lens distortion or Dutch angles, which are not present.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe caption is fundamentally flawed because it misidentifies the camera angle and, more importantly, misses the time-lapse effect, which is a primary characteristic of the video and a key requirement of the prompt.\n\n### Example of a Good Caption\n\nHere is a caption that accurately follows all the given instructions:\n\n\"This **time-lapse** video, shot from a **high angle** high up in the stands, maintains a **deep focus**, keeping the entire stadium sharp. The camera performs a slow and smooth **intermittent pan to the right**, gradually revealing more of the crowded stands and the field.\"",
