    "pre_caption": "This video is filmed with a noticeable fisheye distortion from a camera that starts at hip level and moves to ground level. The camera smoothly pans to the left, tracking a skateboarder, and tilts slightly upward as they jump and downward as they land. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features noticable fisheye distortion causing straight lines to curve outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees) and then moves to a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans to the left, smoothly following the skateboarder, tilting slightly upward as they jump and downward as they land.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while panning and tilting.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the fisheye distortion and the general camera path, it oversimplifies the techniques used and misses key cinematic elements. The description of \"deep focus\" is likely inaccurate; in a dynamic, close-up action shot like this, it's more probable that the camera uses a shallow depth of field to isolate the skateboarder, keeping them tack-sharp while the background and perhaps the immediate foreground pavement are softly blurred. The term \"pans to the left\" is also misleading. To follow the skateboarder smoothly, the camera isn't just rotating from a fixed point but is actively *trucking* left, moving parallel to the subject, likely with a gimbal to ensure a steady, floating quality. The caption also omits the crucial detail that the video likely employs *speed ramping*; the footage probably transitions into slow-motion as the skateboarder launches into the air to emphasize the trick's execution and then returns to normal speed upon landing. Finally, it fails to specify the camera angle, which, by starting at hip-level and moving lower, is a distinct *low angle* shot, used purposefully to make the skateboarder and their jump appear more dramatic and impressive.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This video features a dynamic skateboarding scene captured with noticeable fisheye distortion. The camera starts at hip level and moves to ground level, employing a low-angle shot to enhance the drama of the skateboarder's jump. It smoothly trucks left, moving parallel to the skateboarder with the aid of a gimbal for a steady, floating effect. The camera tilts slightly upward as the skateboarder jumps and downward as they land. A shallow depth of field is used to keep the skateboarder tack-sharp while softly blurring the background and foreground. The video likely incorporates speed ramping, transitioning into slow-motion during the jump to highlight the trick's execution before returning to normal speed upon landing.",
