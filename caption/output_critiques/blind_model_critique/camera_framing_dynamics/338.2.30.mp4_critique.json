    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the foreground with a shallow depth of field. The camera smoothly pans left at a quick speed, maintaining focus on the person in the foreground.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, such as the camera height, angle, and depth of field. However, it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the type of camera movement and could be more precise with its terminology according to the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"camera at eye level with a level angle\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned at roughly the subject's shoulder/chest height and the horizon is level.\n    *   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: This is correct. The subject is in focus while the background is significantly blurred.\n    *   **\"smoothly\"**: The camera movement is very steady and smooth, likely achieved with a gimbal or dolly.\n    *   **\"maintaining focus on the person\"**: This is accurate. The focus remains locked on the subject as they move.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **\"pans left\"**: This is the main inaccuracy. A **pan** is a rotational movement where the camera pivots horizontally on a fixed axis. In the video, the entire camera rig moves laterally from right to left, parallel to the subject. This movement is called a **truck** or **tracking shot**.\n    *   **\"focusing on the foreground\"**: This is a minor imprecision. The subject is more accurately in the **midground**. The foreground would be the space between the camera and the subject, which is also out of focus.\n    *   **\"quick speed\"**: This is subjective, but \"moderate\" might be a more precise description of the speed. It's not slow, but it's not exceptionally fast either.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but misses a few key descriptive terms mentioned in the instructions that would make it more complete and professional.\n\n*   **Missing Movement Purpose:** The instruction asks for the purpose of the movement. The camera is **tracking** the subject. While implied, stating it explicitly would improve the description.\n*   **Missing Focus Terminology:** The instruction mentions **\"focus tracking\"**. The caption describes the action (\"maintaining focus on the person\") but doesn't use the specific technical term, which would make it more informative.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the spirit of the instructions by being concise and describing the requested elements. However, it fails to use the specific, more accurate terminology for camera movement and focus that the instructions provide (e.g., `tracking`, `trucking`, `focus tracking`). It correctly omits details like video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard and not noteworthy, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\n**\"From an eye-level, level angle, the camera smoothly trucks left at a moderate speed, tracking a person. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field, using focus tracking to keep the subject in the midground sharp against a blurred background.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Accurate Movement:** Uses the correct term **\"trucks left\"** instead of \"pans left.\"\n*   **Specifies Purpose:** Explicitly states that the camera is **\"tracking a person.\"**\n*   **Precise Focus Plane:** Correctly identifies the subject as being in the **\"midground.\"**\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology:** Incorporates the term **\"focus tracking\"** as suggested by the instructions.\n*   **Comprehensive:** It covers all the key visual information (height, angle, movement, speed, purpose, focus, and depth) concisely and accurately.",
