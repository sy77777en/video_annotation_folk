    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans right and tilts up to follow the bird walking on mud, with occasional pauses.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning rightward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions provided, here is an evaluation of the caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **good** and effectively captures the main technical aspects of the video. It is concise, accurate in what it describes, and easy to understand. However, it could be slightly more complete to perfectly align with all the specific requirements of the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### Accuracy:\n*   **High-Angle View:** Correct. The caption accurately identifies the camera's position relative to the subject.\n*   **Deep Focus:** Correct. It correctly notes that elements in both the foreground and background are likely in focus.\n*   **Camera Movement (Pan right, Tilt up):** Correct. The description of the camera's rotation is specific and accurate.\n*   **Movement Purpose (follow the bird):** Correct. This accurately describes the motivation behind the camera's movement, which is a form of tracking.\n*   **Steadiness (slightly unsteady, some shaking):** Correct. This provides a good qualitative description of the camera's stability, suggesting a handheld shot.\n\n#### Completeness:\n*   **What's Missing:** The primary element missing from the caption is the **Camera Height**. The instructions specifically ask for height relative to the ground (e.g., *eye-level, hip-level, overhead*). While \"high-angle\" describes the angle of view, it doesn't specify the camera's altitude. For example, a person standing and filming their feet would be an *eye-level* shot at a *high angle*. A drone shot would be an *aerial-level* shot at a *high angle*. This detail is absent.\n*   **Minor Omission:** The instructions list \"tracking\" as a specific type of movement. While \"follow the bird\" is perfectly clear and functionally the same, using the term \"tracks\" would be slightly more aligned with the provided technical vocabulary.\n\n#### Adherence to Instructions:\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise and omits unnecessary information (e.g., it correctly doesn't mention video speed or lens distortion, implying they are normal).\n    *   **Clarity:** It clearly describes the angle, focus, movement, and steadiness in a single, coherent description.\n    *   **Movement Description:** It correctly identifies the type, direction, and quality of the movement as requested.\n\n*   **Area for Improvement:**\n    *   The caption does not fully adhere to the instruction to describe **camera height**. This is the most significant deviation from the provided guidelines.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good because it is accurate and concise. It fails to be \"excellent\" only because it omits the specific detail of camera height, which was explicitly requested in the instructions.\n\n**Revised Caption for Excellence:**\n\nTo make the caption fully compliant and even more precise, it could be revised as follows:\n\n> **\"From an eye-level, high-angle perspective with deep focus, the camera tracks a bird walking on mud. The movement consists of a slightly unsteady pan to the right and tilt up, with occasional pauses.\"**\n\nThis revised version:\n1.  Adds the missing **camera height** (\"eye-level\").\n2.  Uses the more technical term **\"tracks\"** instead of \"follow.\"\n3.  Remains concise and informative.",
