    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\nThe provided caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The caption is 100% accurate in its description of the video.\n    *   **\"Fixed, slightly unsteady shot\"**: This is a precise description. The camera's position does not change (fixed), but there is a minor, natural handheld shake (slightly unsteady).\n    *   **\"Eye-level, level angle\"**: This correctly identifies the camera's height and angle. The perspective is from the photographer's point of view, looking straight ahead.\n    *   **\"Deep focus\"**: This is the correct term. Both the foreground (the hands and camera) and the background (the distant posts) are in sharp focus. The descriptive clause that follows (\"keeping the entire scene... sharp and clear\") reinforces this point accurately.\n\n*   **Completeness & Conciseness:** The caption masterfully balances being informative with being concise, as instructed.\n    *   It correctly covers all the notable aspects of the shot: camera movement/steadiness, height, angle, and focus.\n    *   It correctly omits any mention of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, or a **Dutch angle**, because the video is at regular speed, has no discernible distortion, and the horizon is level. This demonstrates a perfect understanding of the instruction to \"not mention\" default or absent features.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows all instructions precisely.\n    *   It provides a concise yet informative description of the camera's configuration.\n    *   It correctly identifies the camera's steadiness, height, angle, and focus characteristics using appropriate terminology.\n    *   It successfully applies the rule of omission for non-notable features, resulting in a clean and efficient description.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption is a perfect example of what was requested. It is a high-quality, professional description that is both technically accurate and easy to understand. No improvements are needed.",
