    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the foreground, and later becomes focused on the midground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is highly effective and adheres very well to the instructions. It is accurate, concise, and uses the correct technical terminology to describe the shot's key attributes.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is excellent. It successfully distills the most important visual and technical information into a clear and concise description, demonstrating a strong understanding of cinematography and the provided instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n**1. Accuracy:** The caption is almost entirely accurate.\n\n*   **`eye-level tracking shot`**: Correct. The camera is positioned at a height that mimics a person's viewpoint and moves forward to follow the subject. While \"dolly forward\" is a more precise term for moving the entire camera setup forward, \"tracking shot\" is commonly used to mean following a subject, so it is acceptable and well-understood here.\n*   **`follows a woman... from behind`**: Correct. This accurately describes the subject and the camera's relationship to her.\n*   **`causing her to become larger in the frame`**: Correct. This is a sharp observation. The camera is moving slightly faster than the woman, which makes her gradually fill more of the frame.\n*   **`slightly unsteady`**: Correct. The camera has a subtle, natural wobble characteristic of a handheld or shoulder-mounted shot.\n*   **`shallow depth of field`**: Correct. The background is significantly out of focus, isolating the subject.\n*   **`begins with the focus on the woman in the foreground`**: Correct. The initial focus plane is on the woman.\n*   **`executing a rack focus to a man in the midground`**: Correct. The focus visibly shifts from the foreground subject (the woman) to the midground subject (the man).\n\n**2. Completeness:** The caption is very complete, capturing all the essential elements without being verbose.\n\n*   **Camera Height & Angle:** It correctly identifies the `eye-level` height. It implicitly describes a `level angle` by not mentioning any high, low, or Dutch angles.\n*   **Movement:** It covers the type (`tracking`), steadiness (`slightly unsteady`), and purpose (`follows a woman`).\n*   **Focus:** It expertly describes the depth of field (`shallow`), the initial focus plane (`foreground`), and the dynamic focus change (`rack focus` to the `midground`).\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions perfectly.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** It is a model of conciseness. It packs a significant amount of technical detail into just two sentences.\n*   **Omission of Redundant Information:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is regular), **lens distortion** (which is absent), and **Dutch angle** (which is absent). This shows a careful reading of the rules.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specified terminology precisely and appropriately (e.g., `eye-level`, `tracking shot`, `shallow depth of field`, `rack focus`, `foreground`, `midground`).\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Perfection\n\nWhile the caption is excellent, one could argue for a single, very minor refinement for absolute technical precision:\n\n*   Replace \"tracking shot\" with \"dolly shot\" or \"dolly-in.\" A **tracking shot** technically refers to moving parallel to the subject (e.g., alongside a running person), while a **dolly shot** refers to moving toward or away from the subject. However, this is a fine point of pedantry, and \"tracking\" is widely accepted in this context.\n\n**Revised Caption for Technical Perfection (Optional):**\n\"This is an eye-level **dolly shot** that follows a woman with blonde hair from behind as she walks forward, causing her to become larger in the frame. The slightly unsteady camera uses a shallow depth of field, beginning with the focus on the woman in the foreground before executing a rack focus to a man in the midground.\"\n\nEven without this change, the original caption is a superb example of how to apply the given instructions.",
