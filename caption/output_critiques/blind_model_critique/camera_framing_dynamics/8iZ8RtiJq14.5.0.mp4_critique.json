    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **\"From an eye-level, level angle...\"**: This is correct. The camera is held at a height and angle consistent with a person standing and looking straight ahead.\n*   **\"...the slightly unsteady camera...\"**: This accurately captures the natural, subtle shake of a handheld camera, distinguishing it from a perfectly stable dolly or gimbal shot.\n*   **\"...moves slowly forward...\"**: This correctly identifies the primary camera movement (a dolly-in or forward walk) and its speed.\n*   **\"...toward the silver, faceless figure.\"**: This specifies the direction and purpose of the movement, which is to approach the mannequin.\n*   **\"The shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire store scene sharp.\"**: This is a precise description of the focus. Both the foreground (shelves) and the background (the figure and the back of the store) are clear and in focus.\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon. It successfully omits details for default settings as instructed (e.g., it doesn't mention the regular video speed or the absence of lens distortion/Dutch angle).\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It covers all the relevant aspects requested:\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** Correctly identified as \"eye-level, level angle.\"\n    *   **Movement:** The type (\"moves... forward\"), speed (\"slowly\"), and steadiness (\"slightly unsteady\") are all included.\n    *   **Focus:** The depth of field (\"deep focus\") is clearly stated and explained.\n*   **Clarity:** The description is easy to understand and paints a clear picture of the shot's technical and visual characteristics. It effectively combines multiple descriptors into a fluid, readable sentence.",
