    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on a very narrow plane. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and zooming out.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and successfully identifies the most complex and defining characteristic of the shot—the dolly zoom—while adhering closely to the provided instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail it presents:\n\n*   **\"slightly unsteady, eye-level shot with a level angle\"**: This is a perfect description. The camera has a subtle, natural handheld shake. It is positioned at the approximate eye level of a standing person and is not tilted up, down, or sideways.\n*   **\"extremely shallow depth of field, keeping the person in the foreground in sharp focus\"**: This is also spot-on. The background is heavily blurred, indicating a very wide aperture or a long focal length, creating an \"extremely shallow\" depth of field. The focus is correctly identified as being locked on the foreground subject.\n*   **\"The camera moves forward while simultaneously zooming out\"**: This is the most crucial and most accurate observation. This technique is known as a **dolly zoom** or \"Vertigo effect.\" The camera physically moves forward (dollies in) while the lens zooms out. This creates the distinct visual effect where the foreground subject remains roughly the same size in the frame, while the background appears to expand and rush toward the viewer. The caption correctly identifies both components of this complex movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete, covering all the *relevant* aspects of the shot as required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Included Elements**: It correctly covers steadiness, camera height, camera angle, depth of field, focus plane, and the complex camera movement (translation and zooming).\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly)**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of:\n    *   **Video Speed**: The video is at regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable fisheye or barrel distortion.\n    *   **Dutch Angle**: The horizon is level.\n    *   **Shot Transitions**: The video is a single, continuous shot.\n*   **Minor Omissions**: The camera performs a very subtle **pan to the right** to keep the subject centered as she moves slightly. However, the instructions state, *\"If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change.\"* The dolly zoom is the primary, intentional movement, while the pan is a minor, corrective one. Omitting it in favor of conciseness is a perfectly valid and even preferable choice.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the provided instructions exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical information into three clear, easy-to-read sentences without any fluff.\n*   **Describes Configuration**: It effectively describes the video's and camera's configuration by covering the key points listed in the instructions.\n*   **Identifies Complex Movement**: It excels at describing the camera's movements, correctly identifying the simultaneous dolly and zoom. It uses clear, accessible language (\"moves forward\") which is a valid way to describe a dolly, as suggested by the instructions themselves: *\"dollying (moving forward/backward)\"*.\n*   **Describes Focus**: The description of the depth of field and focus plane is precise and uses appropriate terminology (\"extremely shallow depth of field,\" \"foreground in sharp focus\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically accurate, prioritizes the most important visual information, and remains concise. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography by correctly identifying the sophisticated dolly zoom technique. No improvements are necessary.",
