    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the street view with deep focus and a large depth of field. It moves forward, slightly unsteady with some shaking, and midway, it pans right to adjust its orientation while continuing forward, revealing more of the street scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward to capture the street view. Midway, it pans right to adjust its orientation while continuing moving forward to reveal more of the scene.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is very good and accurately describes the video according to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Height and Angle:** The caption correctly identifies the camera as being at **eye level** with a **level angle**, which matches the perspective of someone walking down the street.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** It accurately states the video has **deep focus** and a **large depth of field**, as nearly everything from the foreground to the background is sharp and clear.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement is precise. The camera does **move forward** with a **slight unsteadiness** typical of handheld or body-mounted footage. It also correctly identifies the **pan right** that occurs midway through the shot while the forward motion continues.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The caption correctly infers the purpose of the pan is to \"adjust its orientation... revealing more of the street scene.\"\n\n### Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Covers Key Elements:** The caption successfully covers all the relevant configurations present in the video: camera height, angle, focus/depth of field, and movement (including type, steadiness, and temporal order).\n*   **Conciseness:** It adheres to the instruction to be concise by correctly omitting any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all standard or absent in the video.\n*   **Movement Terminology:** It uses the correct technical term \"pans right\" and clearly describes the sequence of movements (\"moves forward... and midway, it pans right... while continuing forward\").\n\n### Minor Suggestion for Improvement\nWhile \"moves forward\" is perfectly clear and accurate, using the more technical term **\"dollies forward\"** would align even more closely with the specific terminology provided in the instructions (\"dollying (moving forward/backward)\").\n\n**Revised Caption for Perfection:**\n\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, capturing the street view with deep focus and a large depth of field. It **dollies forward**, slightly unsteady with some shaking, and midway, it pans right to adjust its orientation while continuing its forward movement, revealing more of the street scene.\"\n\nEven without this minor change, the original caption is excellent and effectively fulfills all the requirements of the prompt.",
