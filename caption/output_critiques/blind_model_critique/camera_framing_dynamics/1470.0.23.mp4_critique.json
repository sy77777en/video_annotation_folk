    "pre_caption": "The video features a high-angle shot at eye level, focusing on a woman's head amidst scattered toys on the floor. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, concentrating on the midground where the woman's head is located. There is a smooth zoom-in movement, enhancing the focus on the subject without any shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is zooming in.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a decent attempt but contains significant inaccuracies regarding camera height and movement. While it correctly identifies some aspects like the angle and depth of field, it fails on key technical distinctions that are central to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:**\n    *   **`high-angle shot`**: Correct. The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down.\n    *   **`focusing on a woman's head amidst scattered toys`**: Correct. This accurately describes the scene's content.\n    *   **`shallow depth of field, concentrating on the midground`**: Correct. The focus is clearly on the woman (midground), while the toys further away in the background are out of focus.\n    *   **`smooth... without any shaking`**: Correct. The camera movement is very steady.\n\n*   **What it gets wrong:**\n    *   **`at eye level`**: **Incorrect and contradictory.** A \"high-angle shot\" cannot simultaneously be at \"eye level\" (unless the subject is in a pit). Eye-level refers to the camera being at the height of a subject's eyes, creating a level perspective. Here, the camera is a few feet off the ground, but it is distinctly *above* the subject, which is what makes it a high-angle shot.\n    *   **`zoom-in movement`**: **Incorrect.** This is the most critical error. The camera is not zooming; it is **dollying in**.\n        *   A **zoom** changes the lens's focal length, which magnifies the subject but flattens the perspective. The relationship between foreground and background objects would feel compressed.\n        *   A **dolly** physically moves the entire camera forward through space. You can see the perspective and parallax shift naturally as the camera moves past the toys, which confirms it is a dolly, not a zoom.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but misses a few key details required by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Movement Complexity:** The caption identifies a single movement (\"zoom-in\"). It misses that the camera is also performing a very subtle **pan to the right** as it dollies in to keep the woman's head perfectly framed.\n*   **Focus Changes:** While it correctly identifies the shallow depth of field, it doesn't mention that the focus is **maintained or tracked** on the subject throughout the dolly movement, as per the instruction to describe dynamic focus changes like \"focus tracking.\"\n*   **Camera Height:** The description \"at eye level\" is inaccurate. A more precise description would be `low-level` or `a few feet above the ground`.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption successfully adheres to the instruction to be concise.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses some correct terms (`high-angle`, `shallow depth of field`, `midground`) but fails critically by using `zoom-in` instead of `dolly-in`. The instructions place a high value on correctly identifying specific movement types.\n*   **Omissions:** It correctly omits details like `regular video speed` and `no lens distortion`, which follows the instruction to only mention these if they are present or altered.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: Is the caption good?\n\n**No, the caption is not good.** While it has some correct elements, the inaccurate description of the camera's height and, most importantly, the fundamental misidentification of a **dolly** as a **zoom** make it fail to meet the core requirements of the instructions. The instructions demand a precise and technically accurate description of the camera's configuration and movement, and this caption falls short on those key points.\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n\"This is a high-angle shot from a few feet above the ground. The camera performs a slow, steady **dolly-in** toward the woman's head, combined with a slight **pan right** to keep her centered in the frame. The shot uses a **shallow depth of field**, maintaining sharp focus on the woman in the midground while the background remains blurred.\"",
