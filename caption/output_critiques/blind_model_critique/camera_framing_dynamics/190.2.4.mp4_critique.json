    "pre_caption": "The video features a camera at eye level with a level angle. It employs a shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground. The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a perfect fit for the video.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n*   **Accuracy: Excellent**\n    *   **Camera Height and Angle:** The caption states the camera is at **\"eye level with a level angle,\"** which is accurate. The camera is positioned straight-on with the flower, not looking down from a high angle or up from a low angle.\n    *   **Focus:** The description of a **\"shallow depth of field, focusing on the foreground\"** is spot-on. The white flower in the foreground is in sharp focus, while the green foliage in the background is completely blurred, isolating the subject perfectly.\n    *   **Movement and Steadiness:** The phrase **\"fixed but slightly unsteady, with no intentional movement\"** is a brilliant and nuanced description. The camera's framing does not change (it is fixed), but there is a subtle, high-frequency jitter characteristic of a handheld shot, which is perfectly captured by \"slightly unsteady.\"\n\n*   **Completeness: Excellent**\n    *   The caption successfully identifies and describes all the relevant camera and video configurations present in the shot: height, angle, focus, and movement/steadiness.\n    *   It correctly identifies that there are no other significant attributes to mention for this specific video.\n\n*   **Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and effective. As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of the video's normal playback speed, the lack of lens distortion, and the absence of a Dutch angle, which makes the description clean and to the point.\n    *   **Specificity:** It provides the specific details requested, such as the type of depth of field, the focus plane (foreground), and a precise description of the camera's stability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is an exemplary response to the instructions. It is accurate, concise, and provides a complete technical description of the shot's visual characteristics without any unnecessary information. No improvements are needed.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a scene with the camera positioned at eye level and a level angle. It uses a shallow depth of field to focus sharply on the foreground, highlighting a white flower while the background remains blurred. The camera remains fixed but exhibits a slight, unintentional jitter typical of a handheld shot, with no deliberate movement.",
