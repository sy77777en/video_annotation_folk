    "pre_caption": "The camera is quite unsteady, with motion that lacks a clear pattern.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is quite unsteady, but its motion lacks a clear pattern.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an excellent exercise. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the instructions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it is extremely incomplete and fails to adhere to the detailed instructions provided. While it is concise and partially accurate, it omits nearly all of the specific technical details required by the prompt, resulting in a description that is vague and uninformative.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What it gets right:** The statement \"The camera is quite unsteady\" is accurate. The video is characterized by significant shaking and wobbling, consistent with being handheld by someone who is walking.\n*   **What it gets wrong/is misleading:** The phrase \"with motion that lacks a clear pattern\" is misleading. While the *shakiness* is erratic, the **primary motion** has a very clear pattern and purpose: the camera is consistently moving forward along a path. The caption completely ignores this fundamental forward dolly/tracking movement and focuses only on the chaotic nature of the shake, misrepresenting the overall action.\n\n#### 2. Completeness (and Adherence to Instructions)\n\nThe caption fails to address the vast majority of the required descriptive points.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** Not mentioned. (This is acceptable, as the video is at regular speed).\n*   **Lens Distortion:** **Missed.** There is slight barrel distortion visible, causing the trees at the edges of the frame to curve slightly outwards.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** **Missed.** The camera is at **chest-level** and maintains a mostly **level angle**, pointing forward. It occasionally tilts down slightly.\n*   **Movements:** **Critically Incomplete.**\n    *   **Primary Movement:** It completely omits the main movement, which is a **dolly forward** or **tracking forward** at a walking pace.\n    *   **Steadiness:** It correctly identifies the shot as \"unsteady\" but fails to describe the nature of the unsteadiness (e.g., high-frequency **shake**, **wobble**, and **roll**).\n    *   **Secondary Movements:** It misses the small, erratic **pans** and **tilts** that simulate a person's natural head movements.\n    *   **Purpose:** It fails to mention the purpose of the movement, which is to create a realistic **first-person point-of-view (POV)** of someone walking.\n*   **Focus:** **Missed.** The video has a **shallow depth of field**, where the midground (the path a few feet ahead) is in focus, while the immediate foreground and the distant background are soft. The focus appears to be fixed on the midground.\n\n### Why the Caption Fails\n\nThe instruction asks for a \"concise yet informative description\" covering a specific list of technical attributes. The provided caption prioritizes conciseness to the point of being uninformative. It reads like a casual observation rather than a technical analysis. It ignores the core requirements of describing the camera's configuration, primary movement, height, angle, and focus.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption (Following the Instructions)\n\nHere is an example of a caption that correctly follows the instructions for this video:\n\n\"This chest-level, first-person POV shot dollies forward at a walking pace. The movement is extremely unsteady, with constant, high-frequency shaking, wobbling, and rolling. The camera makes small, erratic pans and tilts, simulating a person looking around. The shot has a shallow depth of field with the focus fixed on the midground, and slight barrel distortion is visible.\"",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This chest-level, first-person POV shot moves forward at a walking pace, characterized by significant unsteadiness with high-frequency shaking, wobbling, and rolling. The camera occasionally makes small, erratic pans and tilts, mimicking natural head movements. The video features a shallow depth of field, with the midground in focus, while slight barrel distortion causes the edges of the frame to curve outward.",
