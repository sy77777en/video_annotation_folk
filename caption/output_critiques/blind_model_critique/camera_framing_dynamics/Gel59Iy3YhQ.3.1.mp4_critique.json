    "pre_caption": "This fast-motion, eye-level shot moves smoothly forward through an office hallway, intermittently trucking slightly left and right. The camera maintains a level angle and a deep focus, keeping the entire scene in sharp detail.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A fast-motion video with forward playback speed slightly faster than real-time (1x–3x).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward with slight, intermittent trucking that alternates between right and left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery technical term used in the caption correctly describes the video's visual properties:\n*   **\"Fast-motion\"**: The video is clearly sped up, which is accurately identified.\n*   **\"Eye-level shot\"**: The camera's height is consistent with the perspective of a person walking, making \"eye-level\" the correct description.\n*   **\"Moves smoothly forward\"**: The primary camera movement is a forward dolly, and it is executed very smoothly, without any noticeable shaking or wobbling.\n*   **\"Intermittently trucking slightly left and right\"**: This accurately captures the subtle, natural side-to-side sway that occurs as the camera moves forward, correctly using the term \"trucking\" for lateral movement.\n*   **\"Level angle\"**: The camera maintains a straight, level view of the hallway without tilting up, down, or sideways.\n*   **\"Deep focus\"**: The entire scene, from the immediate foreground to the distant end of the hallway, remains in sharp focus, which is the definition of deep focus.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting what isn't present:\n*   **Included**: It covers the altered video speed, camera height, primary and secondary movements, movement quality (smoothness), camera angle, and focus depth.\n*   **Omitted**: As per the instructions, it correctly leaves out mentions of lens distortion and Dutch angles, as neither is present in the video. It also doesn't mention focus changes or shot transitions because the video is a single, continuous shot with a fixed focus.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the prompt's guidelines precisely:\n*   **Concise and Informative**: It packs a significant amount of technical detail into two clear and easy-to-read sentences.\n*   **Correct Terminology**: It uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions (e.g., \"fast-motion,\" \"trucking,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus\") correctly.\n*   **Logical Structure**: The description flows logically, starting with the overall shot type (fast-motion, eye-level) and then detailing the movement and focus characteristics.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to apply the given instructions. It is technically precise, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and efficiently written.",
