    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera steadily moves upward and backward while rolling counter clockwise to reveal more of the intersection.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, concise, and adheres perfectly to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Perspective:** The description \"high, aerial perspective\" is accurate. The camera is positioned far above the ground (aerial) and at a high angle looking down. \"Bird's-eye view\" would also be a correct term for the angle.\n*   **Focus:** The caption correctly identifies the \"deep focus,\" as everything from the vehicles in the foreground to the buildings in the background is sharp and clear.\n*   **Movement:** The description of the camera movement is precise. It correctly identifies three simultaneous actions:\n    1.  **Upward:** The camera gains altitude.\n    2.  **Backward:** The camera moves away from the intersection (a dolly out).\n    3.  **Rolling counter-clockwise:** The camera rotates around its lens axis, causing the frame to turn.\n*   **Steadiness:** The movement is correctly described as \"steady,\" indicating a smooth, controlled motion, likely from a drone or a digital effect.\n*   **Purpose:** The caption accurately states the purpose of the movement: \"revealing a wider view of the intersection and the convoy of trucks.\"\n\n### Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise while packing in all the critical information. It correctly omits details that are not present, such as lens distortion, altered video speed, or focus changes, as per the instructions.\n*   **Configuration Details:** It successfully covers all the relevant aspects requested:\n    *   **Camera Angle & Height:** \"high, aerial perspective\"\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus\"\n    *   **Movements:** \"steadily moves upward and backward while simultaneously rolling counter-clockwise\"\n*   **Clarity:** The description of the complex, multi-axis movement is clear and easy to understand. It avoids overly technical jargon while remaining precise.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the provided instructions. It analyzes the shot's technical aspects correctly and synthesizes them into a clear, informative, and concise description.",
