    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans left smoothly, revealing the scene.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a very well-written and accurate caption that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n\n*   **Camera Position:** The description of \"eye level\" and \"level angle\" is perfectly accurate. The camera is not positioned unusually high or low, and the horizon is straight and centered.\n*   **Focus:** The caption correctly identifies \"deep focus and a large depth of field.\" All elements, from the foreground grass to the distant clouds and hills, are sharp and in focus.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The movement is precisely a \"smooth pan left.\"\n*   **Steadiness:** The description \"very steady, with no shaking\" is accurate. The movement is fluid, suggesting the use of a tripod or gimbal.\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe caption is both concise and comprehensive, successfully including all relevant information while omitting unnecessary details, just as the instructions advise.\n\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes the key, non-default characteristics of the shot: camera height, angle, focus, and movement (type, direction, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so इसका उल्लेख नहीं किया गया, following the instruction.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so इसका उल्लेख नहीं किया गया.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so इसका उल्लेख नहीं किया गया.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** There is only one continuous shot, so transitions are not mentioned.\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The caption brilliantly incorporates the purpose of the movement by stating it is \"revealing a wide, open landscape,\" which adds valuable context and demonstrates a high-level understanding of the instructions.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instruction: Excellent**\n\nThe caption follows the instructions<seg_52>यता से.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs all the necessary technical details into two clear, readable sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Focus on Configuration:** The description is centered on the *how* (camera configuration and movement) rather than just the *what* (the content of the scene), which is the primary goal of the instructions.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses the correct terminology पुलिस द्वारा दिए गए निर्देशों के अनुसार, जैसे \"pan,\" \"deep focus,\" \"depth of field,\" \"eye level,\" and \"level angle.\"\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate in its technical assessment, complete in its coverage of relevant details, and perfectly concise. There are no corrections or improvements needed.",
