    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning left.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is panning leftward to track the subject.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The provided caption is a perfect example of how to follow the instructions. It is accurate, complete, and adheres to all the specified guidelines.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The caption is excellent. It is a model response that is both technically accurate and perfectly aligned with the instructions, especially regarding conciseness and the inclusion of relevant details.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Accuracy:\nThe description is 100% accurate.\n*   **Camera Angle and Height:** The shot is indeed from a **level angle** (parallel to the ground) and at **eye-level** (the height of a standing observer).\n*   **Camera Movement:** The camera performs a **smooth pan to the left**. The purpose of this movement is correctly identified as **tracking** the subject (the person on the horse).\n*   **Focus:** The video exhibits a **deep focus**, where the subject, the foreground (dirt), and the background (trees and fence) are all sharp and in focus. The caption correctly identifies this and explains it clearly (\"keeping the entire scene sharp\").\n\n#### 2. Completeness:\nThe caption is perfectly complete, including all necessary information while correctly omitting what is not present.\n*   **Included:** It correctly identifies and describes the key active elements: camera angle, height, movement (pan, tracking, smoothness), and focus (deep).\n*   **Omitted (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly omitted as per the instruction: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed... there is no need to mention these.\"*\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no visible distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so this was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Complex Movements:** The shot is a simple pan. The caption avoids mentioning other movements like tilting, zooming, or craning, because they do not occur.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or focus tracking.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions:\nThe caption masterfully follows every rule provided in the instructions.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is concise and efficient. It combines the camera's position (`level, eye-level perspective`) and movement (`smoothly pans left to track`) into a single, flowing sentence.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the precise terminology requested, such as `pan`, `track`, and `deep focus`.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and easy to understand for anyone, even if they are not a cinematography expert, thanks to the explanatory phrase \"keeping the entire scene sharp.\"\n*   **Structure:** The caption is well-structured, first establishing the camera's static properties (angle, height) before describing its dynamic properties (movement, focus).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is an exemplary response. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the video's technical aspects and a perfect application of the detailed instructions. It is accurate in its analysis, complete in its coverage of relevant features, and concise in its delivery. No improvements are needed.",
