    "pre_caption": "This is a very smooth, aerial drone shot with a deep focus, keeping the entire town sharp. The camera begins at a high angle, looking down on the rooftops, and maintains a varying Dutch angle as it rolls. It performs a complex motion, first moving forward over the buildings, then arcing clockwise to reveal a church on a hill, and finally moving forward again. As it moves, the camera angle transitions to a more level perspective.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion. The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone performs complex motions to showcase the town, moving forward, arcing clockwise, and finishing with another forward movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate, very detailed, and closely follows the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe caption is **excellent**. It successfully captures the key technical and aesthetic aspects of the video, using precise terminology as requested in the instructions. It is both concise and deeply informative.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n#### Accuracy:\nThe caption is almost perfectly accurate.\n\n*   **\"very smooth, aerial drone shot\"**: **Correct.** The movement is fluid and stabilized, characteristic of a high-quality drone with a gimbal. The perspective is clearly aerial.\n*   **\"deep focus, keeping the entire town sharp\"**: **Correct.** Everything from the foreground rooftops to the distant church and hills is in sharp focus.\n*   **\"begins at a high angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is initially looking down significantly.\n*   **\"maintains a varying Dutch angle as it rolls\"**: This is the only point with a minor ambiguity, though it's largely correct. The camera *starts* with a Dutch angle and then *rolls* to correct it, eventually leveling the horizon. Phrasing it as \"maintains a varying Dutch angle\" is slightly confusing. A more precise description would be: \"It begins with a Dutch angle that is gradually corrected as the camera rolls to level the horizon.\" However, the core elements (Dutch angle, rolling) are correctly identified.\n*   **\"complex motion, first moving forward... then arcing clockwise to reveal a church... and finally moving forward again\"**: **Perfectly accurate.** This correctly breaks down the complex camera path into its sequential components and identifies the purpose of the arc (\"to reveal a church\").\n*   **\"camera angle transitions to a more level perspective\"**: **Correct.** As the camera moves, it tilts up, reducing the severity of the high angle and making the shot feel more direct and level with the horizon by the end.\n\n#### Completeness:\nThe caption is exceptionally complete, adhering to the rule of omitting unnecessary information.\n\n*   **Video Speed**: The video is at a regular speed. The caption correctly omits this information as per the instruction: \"if the video is at regular playback speed... there is no need to mention these.\"\n*   **Lens Distortion**: There is no noticeable lens distortion. The caption correctly omits this.\n*   **Camera Height & Angle**: Both are described well (\"aerial,\" \"high angle,\" \"transitions to a more level perspective\").\n*   **Movements**: The description of movement is comprehensive, covering steadiness (`smooth`), type (`forward`, `arcing`), direction (`clockwise`), complexity (`complex`), and purpose (`to reveal`).\n*   **Focus**: The `deep focus` is correctly identified. Since there are no focus changes, no further information was needed.\n\n#### Adherence to Instruction:\nThe caption demonstrates a masterful adherence to the detailed instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It packs a large amount of technical detail into just a few sentences without feeling bloated.\n*   **Specific Terminology**: It correctly uses specific terms like `deep focus`, `aerial`, `high angle`, `Dutch angle`, `rolls`, and `arcing clockwise`.\n*   **Movement Description**: It follows the instructions perfectly by describing the complex movement in a clear, temporal order (\"first... then... finally\").\n*   **Omission of Normals**: It correctly leaves out details about normal video speed and the lack of lens distortion, showing a good understanding of the conciseness rule.\n*   **Purpose of Movement**: It includes the purpose of the arc, which adds valuable context.\n\n### Final Verdict:\n\nThis is a high-quality, professional-level caption that meets and exceeds the requirements of the instructions. The only minor point for improvement is the phrasing around the Dutch angle, but this is a very subtle nuance. Overall, it's an exemplary execution of the task.",
