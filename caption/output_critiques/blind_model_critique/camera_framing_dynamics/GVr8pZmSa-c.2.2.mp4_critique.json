    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at hip level. Initially, it's at a high angle, then transitions to a low angle due to camera motion. The video employs a shallow depth of field, starting with the focus on the midground and then shifting to the man in the foreground via a rack focus. The camera pans to the right and tilts up at the beginning to focus on the man in black, while slowly moving backward throughout the entire video. The camera movement is very smooth.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera starts focused on the midground, and later becomes focused on the foreground. The focus plane changes through a rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera pans to the right and tilts up at the beginning to focus on the man in black while slowly moving backward throughout the entire video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent request. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good** and captures the main actions in the video. It correctly identifies the camera height, the general change in angle, the shallow depth of field, the rack focus, and the primary camera movements. However, it can be improved in terms of **accuracy, precision of terminology, and structure** to better align with the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"The camera is positioned at hip level.\"**\n    *   **Accurate.** This is a correct and reasonable estimation of the camera's height.\n\n*   **\"Initially, it's at a high angle, then transitions to a low angle due to camera motion.\"**\n    *   **Partially Accurate.** The terminology could be more precise. The camera starts at a **slightly high angle** (looking down at the floor and the subject's lower body) and then **tilts up** to a **level or slightly low angle** relative to the subject's face. Calling the final position a \"low angle\" is acceptable since the camera is below the subject's eye line, but the transition is more of a tilt from high-to-level/low rather than a full high-to-low transition.\n\n*   **\"The video employs a shallow depth of field, starting with the focus on the midground and then shifting to the man in the foreground via a rack focus.\"**\n    *   **Highly Accurate.** This is an excellent and precise description of the focus and depth of field. It correctly identifies all key elements: shallow DoF, the initial focus plane (midground), and the use of a rack focus.\n\n*   **\"The camera pans to the right and tilts up at the beginning...\"**\n    *   **Slightly Inaccurate Phrasing.** The pan and tilt are not just \"at the beginning\"; they are **continuous movements** that happen throughout the shot to keep the subject framed. The phrasing suggests the movements happen and then stop, which is not the case.\n\n*   **\"...while slowly moving backward throughout the entire video.\"**\n    *   **Accurate.** The camera does move backward slowly and continuously. The correct technical term for this is **dollying backward** or **dollying out**.\n\n*   **\"The camera movement is very smooth.\"**\n    *   **Accurate.** The movement is exceptionally steady, likely achieved with a gimbal or Steadicam.\n\n#### 2. Completeness & Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption successfully follows the instruction to be concise and omits unnecessary information (normal video speed, no lens distortion). However, it misses a few key points and could use more of the specified terminology.\n\n*   **Missing Terminology:**\n    *   **Movement Type:** While \"moving backward\" is correct, the instruction lists **\"dollying\"** as the specific term.\n    *   **Movement Purpose:** The combination of dollying, panning, and tilting is done to follow the subject. The instruction lists **\"tracking\"** for this purpose, which is a key descriptor of the shot's intent.\n\n*   **Incomplete Description of Movement:**\n    *   The caption separates the pan/tilt from the backward movement. In reality, these are three simultaneous movements (dolly, pan, tilt) working together in a single, complex motion to track the subject. Describing them as a unified action would be more complete.\n\n#### 3. Structural Improvements\n\nThe caption's structure is a bit jumbled, mixing camera position, angle, focus, and movement. A more logical flow would be to describe the static properties first (height, DoF) and then the dynamic ones (movement, focus changes).\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to the instructions, using more precise terminology and a clearer structure.\n\n**\"Shot from hip-level with a shallow depth of field, the camera begins at a slightly high angle. It performs a slow, smooth, and complex movement by simultaneously dollying backward, panning right, and tilting up to track a man as he walks toward the camera. During the movement, a rack focus shifts the focus plane from the midground to the man in the foreground, keeping him sharp as he approaches.\"**\n\n### Why the Improved Caption is Better:\n\n*   **Precision:** Uses more specific terms like **\"dollying backward,\" \"tracking,\"** and clarifies the angle as **\"slightly high.\"**\n*   **Completeness:** Explicitly states the purpose of the movement (**\"to track a man\"**) and describes the pan, tilt, and dolly as a single, **simultaneous** action.\n*   **Structure:** It logically presents the initial setup (height, DoF, starting angle) before describing the continuous camera and focus movements.\n*   **Conciseness:** It remains concise while packing in more accurate, technical information as requested by the instructions.",
