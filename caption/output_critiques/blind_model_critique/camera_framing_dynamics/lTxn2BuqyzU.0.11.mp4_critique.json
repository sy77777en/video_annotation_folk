    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** \"The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, focusing on the child in the midground using a shallow depth of field. It moves slowly and smoothly upward, maintaining focus on the child without any shaking.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of the Caption**\n\nThe caption is **good but not entirely accurate or complete.** It correctly identifies several key visual elements but contains a significant error regarding the camera angle and could be more precise in its terminology.\n\n#### **Accuracy: What the Caption Gets Right**\n\n*   **Focus & Depth of Field:** It correctly identifies the **shallow depth of field** (blurry background) and that the focus is on the **child in the midground**.\n*   **Movement & Steadiness:** It accurately describes the camera movement as **slow, smooth, and upward**. It also correctly notes the shot is steady by stating it's \"without any shaking.\"\n\n#### **Accuracy: What the Caption Gets Wrong**\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** This is the most significant error. The caption states it's a \"level angle,\" but the camera is clearly positioned low and tilted slightly up towards the child. This is a **low angle**, not a level one.\n*   **Camera Height:** Describing the height as \"eye level\" is ambiguous. While it is near the *subject's* eye level, a more precise description relative to the room would be **low-level** or **ground-level**, especially at the start of the shot.\n\n#### **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions**\n\nThe caption follows the instruction for conciseness by correctly omitting mentions of normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion. However, it could be more complete and precise by incorporating more specific terminology from the instructions.\n\n*   **Movement Type:** \"Moves... upward\" is a good general description, but a more technical and informative term would be **\"pedestals up\"** or **\"cranes up\"** to describe the vertical camera movement.\n*   **Focus Change:** \"Maintaining focus\" is correct, but the more specific term for a camera keeping a subject in focus as it or the camera moves is **\"focus tracking.\"**\n\n### **Revised, More Accurate Caption**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that is more accurate and complete according to your instructions:\n\n\"Shot from a **low angle** and **low-level**, the camera uses a **shallow depth of field** to focus on a child in the midground. The camera **pedestals up** slowly and smoothly, using **focus tracking** to keep the child's face sharp throughout the movement.\"",
