    "pre_caption": "From an above-water perspective, the camera starts at a low angle looking up at the basilica.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a low angle (looking up from below) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tilts down and slightly rolls clockwise to level its angle while trucking left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is a highly accurate, complete, and concise description that masterfully adheres to the provided instructions. It correctly identifies complex, simultaneous camera movements and other key technical aspects of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is exceptionally accurate in every detail:\n\n*   **\"From an above-water perspective...\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned above the water of the fountain in the foreground.\n*   **\"...the camera starts at a low angle looking up at the basilica.\"**: Correct. The initial framing emphasizes the height and grandeur of the dome from a lower viewpoint.\n*   **\"...smoothly trucks to the left...\"**: Correct. The camera translates horizontally from right to left in a very stable, fluid motion. This is the definition of a truck left.\n*   **\"...while tilting down...\"**: Correct. Simultaneously with the truck, the camera's vertical axis of rotation shifts downward, moving from the dome to the main structure and colonnades.\n*   **\"...and rolling slightly clockwise...\"**: Correct. This is a subtle but crucial observation. As the camera moves, the horizon tilts slightly, with the right side rising and the left side falling, which constitutes a clockwise roll.\n*   **\"...transitioning to a more level angle.\"**: Correct. By the end of the shot, the camera is no longer looking up as dramatically; its angle is more parallel to the ground, creating a level angle relative to the base of the basilica.\n*   **\"The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\"**: Correct. Both the foreground fountain spray and the background basilica are in sharp focus throughout the video, which is characteristic of a deep depth of field.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is perfectly complete according to the instructions, including all relevant information while omitting what is not present.\n\n*   **Included Elements:** It successfully covers camera height, starting and ending camera angles, multiple simultaneous movements (translation, rotation), steadiness (\"smoothly\"), and focus (deep focus).\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so this was correctly omitted as per the instructions.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so it was correctly omitted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to describe a rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions are mentioned.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the instructions with precision and skill.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of technical information into two clear sentences without being verbose.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It uses the specified technical terms accurately (trucks, tilting, rolling, low angle, level angle, deep focus).\n*   **Compound Movement:** It excels at describing the complex, simultaneous camera movements in a logical sequence (\"trucks... while tilting... and rolling\").\n*   **Handling Nuance:** The identification of a \"slight\" clockwise roll demonstrates a high level of observational detail and adherence to the instruction about describing Dutch angles or rolling.\n*   **Rule of Omission:** It perfectly follows the rule to not mention standard features like regular speed or the absence of distortion, which contributes to its conciseness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and written with clarity and conciseness. There are no corrections or improvements to be made.",
