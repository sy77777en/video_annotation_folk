    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera focus is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera steadily cranes upward, progressively unveiling more of the digital navigation interface.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Caption:** The very smooth camera steadily cranes upward, progressively unveiling more of the digital navigation interface.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is a decent but flawed attempt. It correctly identifies the smoothness of the motion and its general purpose. However, it is inaccurate in its description of the primary camera movement and incomplete because it omits several key details required by the instructions, such as camera angle and focus.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Feedback:**\n\n#### **1. Accuracy:**\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **\"very smooth\" and \"steadily\":** This is correct. The camera movement is perfectly fluid and maintains a constant speed, which is typical for a digital animation.\n    *   **\"progressively unveiling more of the digital navigation interface\":** This accurately describes the *result* and *purpose* of the camera movement.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **\"cranes upward\":** This is the main inaccuracy. A **crane** is a physical camera movement where the camera itself moves vertically up or down, often in an arc. This video is a digital animation or screen recording. The effect of revealing more of the map is achieved by **zooming out**, which changes the focal length of the virtual camera. While the visual effect is similar to gaining altitude, the technical term is incorrect.\n    *   The caption also misses the simultaneous **forward tracking** movement along the blue navigation path.\n\n#### **2. Completeness:**\n\nThe caption is incomplete and fails to address several key aspects mandated by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** It omits the **bird's-eye view** (or overhead angle), which is a defining characteristic of the shot.\n*   **Camera Movement:** It fails to mention the full complexity of the movement. The camera is not just \"craning\" (zooming), it is also **tracking forward** along the route.\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** This is a significant omission. The instructions specifically ask to describe the focus. This video has an **infinitely deep focus** where every element on the screen is perfectly sharp. There is no realistic depth of field, which is a crucial detail indicating that this is a digital render and not footage from a physical camera.\n\n#### **3. Adherence to Instructions:**\n\nThe caption only partially adheres to the instructions.\n\n*   It attempts to describe camera movement and its quality (steadiness, speed).\n*   However, it fails to provide a \"concise yet **informative**\" description by omitting critical information about the camera's configuration (angle, focus) and using an incorrect term for the primary movement. The instructions explicitly ask for details on angle and focus, which are completely missing.\n\n---\n\n### **Revised and Improved Caption:**\n\nHere is an example of a caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"From a bird's-eye view, the camera smoothly and simultaneously zooms out while tracking forward along the digital navigation path. The shot is a digital animation with an infinitely deep focus, keeping the entire interface perfectly sharp as more of the map is revealed.\"**",
