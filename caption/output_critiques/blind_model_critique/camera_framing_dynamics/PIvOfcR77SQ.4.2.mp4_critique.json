    "pre_caption": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle, looking straight ahead. It employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. The camera smoothly pans right, capturing the snowy landscape and buildings with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **mostly good but contains a significant factual error.** It successfully identifies and describes the camera's height, angle, focus, and movement using the correct terminology. However, its primary claim about lens distortion is inaccurate.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Correct:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The description of the camera being at `eye level` with a `level angle` is accurate. The perspective is that of a person standing and looking straight ahead.\n    *   **Focus:** The statement that the video `employs deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp` is correct. Both the foreground snow and the background buildings are in focus.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The description of a `smoothly pans right` movement with `minimal shaking` is perfectly accurate. The camera rotates horizontally to the right in a controlled manner.\n\n*   **Incorrect:**\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** The claim that \"The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward\" is **incorrect**. Upon close inspection, the vertical lines of the lampposts and the edges of the buildings appear straight, even at the far edges of the frame. There is no discernible barrel distortion.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   The caption is very complete according to the instructions. It addresses all the relevant, observable aspects of the shot:\n    *   It correctly attempts to address **lens distortion** (even if the conclusion is wrong).\n    *   It correctly identifies **camera height, angle, focus, and movement**.\n    *   It correctly omits details that are not present, such as altered **video speed**, **Dutch angles**, or **focus changes**, which aligns with the instruction to be concise and not mention absent features.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption adheres well to the structural and terminological requirements of the instructions.\n    *   It uses the specified vocabulary, such as `eye level`, `level angle`, `deep focus`, `pans right`, and `minimal shaking`.\n    *   It provides a concise yet informative description, as requested.\n    *   The one failure in adherence is providing inaccurate information. While it followed the instruction to *look for* lens distortion, it incorrectly identified it as being present.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is good in its structure, terminology, and description of most camera parameters. However, the factual error regarding barrel distortion makes it flawed. A good caption must be, above all, accurate.\n\n### Suggested Revision\n\nHere is a corrected version of the caption that is fully accurate and adheres to all instructions:\n\n**\"The camera is positioned at eye level and maintains a level angle. It employs deep focus, keeping all elements of the snowy scene sharp. The camera smoothly pans right with minimal shaking to capture the landscape and buildings.\"**",
