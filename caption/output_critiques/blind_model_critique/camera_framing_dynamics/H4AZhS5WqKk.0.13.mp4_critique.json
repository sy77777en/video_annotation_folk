    "pre_caption": "This is a level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the character in the foreground, Tom, in sharp focus. The camera is mostly static, exhibiting only very minor, smooth movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera shows no clear or intentional movement.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is highly accurate, mostly complete, and adheres well to the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Accuracy: Excellent\nThe caption is extremely accurate in its description of the video's technical aspects.\n*   **\"level-angle shot\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned at the subject's eye level, looking straight at him, not from above or below.\n*   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: Correct. The subject, Tom, is in sharp focus, while the background is heavily blurred and indistinct, indicating a wide aperture was used.\n*   **\"keeps the character in the foreground, Tom, in sharp focus\"**: Correct. The focus plane is fixed on the character in the foreground and does not change.\n*   **\"The camera is mostly static, exhibiting only very minor, smooth movement\"**: This is a very precise and accurate observation. While the camera could be described as \"static,\" there is a subtle, almost imperceptible drift or sway, which this description perfectly captures. It correctly identifies the movement as minor and smooth, not shaky or erratic.\n\n### Completeness: Very Good\nThe caption successfully covers the most prominent features of the shot as required by the instructions. It correctly omits details that are not present, following the rule of conciseness.\n\n*   **What it covers well:** Camera angle, focus/depth of field, and camera movement.\n*   **What it correctly omits:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no discernible distortion, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The frame is level, so no mention is needed.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** It is a single, continuous shot.\n*   **Minor area for improvement:** The instructions list **camera height** (e.g., *eye-level*) as a separate category from **camera angle** (e.g., *level angle*). While \"level-angle\" strongly implies \"eye-level\" in this context, explicitly stating it would make the description even more complete according to the detailed list in the instructions.\n\n### Adherence to Instructions: Excellent\nThe caption follows the provided guidelines exceptionally well.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of accurate technical information into two clear sentences without any fluff.\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology:** It employs the specific terms requested, such as \"level-angle\" and \"shallow depth of field.\"\n*   **Follows Omission Rule:** It correctly avoids mentioning standard video speed, the absence of distortion, or the lack of a Dutch angle, which is a key part of the instruction to \"make the description as concise as possible.\"\n*   **Describes Movement Nuance:** It accurately describes the near-static nature of the camera with the nuance of \"very minor, smooth movement,\" which is more descriptive than simply stating \"static.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It is a model example of how to apply the given instructions: it is accurate, concise, and uses the correct technical language. The only potential addition for absolute completeness would be to specify the \"eye-level\" height, but its absence does not detract from the caption's overall high quality.\n\n**Slightly Revised Version for 100% Completeness:**\n\n\"This is an **eye-level**, level-angle shot with a shallow depth of field that keeps the character in the foreground, Tom, in sharp focus. The camera is almost completely static, exhibiting only very minor, smooth movement.\"",
