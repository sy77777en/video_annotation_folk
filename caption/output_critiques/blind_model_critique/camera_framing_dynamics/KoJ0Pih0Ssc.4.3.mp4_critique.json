    "pre_caption": "This is a smooth, forward-moving shot that begins at ground level with a high angle, looking down at spiked grids. The focus is initially shallow, highlighting the grids in the midground. After three seconds, the camera starts to pan left and tilt upward, raising its height to hip level and shifting to a low angle that looks up at a signal fence. As it tilts, the focus transitions to deep, bringing the entire scene into sharp view.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at a ground level and then moves to a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera initially uses a shallow focus, highlighting the middle ground with grids and spikes. As the camera tilts away, the depth of field expands, transitioning to a deep focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves forward throughout the video. After the first 3 seconds, it starts panning to the left and tilting up to move upward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a good attempt and correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, such as the general movement, changing angles, and initial focus. However, it contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the focus change and lacks the precision in terminology that the instructions call for.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Smoothness & Movement:** The description of a \"smooth, forward-moving shot\" that \"pan[s] left and tilt[s] upward\" is accurate.\n    *   **Height & Angle:** The initial \"ground level\" height, the transition to \"hip level,\" and the shift from a \"high angle\" to a \"low angle\" are all correctly observed.\n    *   **Initial Focus:** The description of the initial focus as \"shallow, highlighting the grids in the midground\" is perfectly accurate.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **The \"Deep Focus\" Claim:** This is the main inaccuracy. The caption states the focus \"transitions to deep, bringing the entire scene into sharp view.\" This is false.\n        *   **Actual Event:** The camera performs a **rack focus** (or focus pull). It shifts the plane of sharp focus from the midground (the spiked grids) to the background (the signal fence).\n        *   **Why it's not \"Deep Focus\":** In the final framing, the foreground (the grids, now at the bottom of the frame) is clearly out of focus. Deep focus requires that elements in the foreground, midground, and background are all simultaneously in sharp focus. The shot maintains a relatively shallow depth of field throughout; it just changes *what* is in focus.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is concise but misses some key descriptive terms required by the instructions.\n\n*   **Missing Movement Terminology:** The instruction asks for specific movement types like `dollying`, `trucking`, and `pedestaling`.\n    *   The \"forward-moving\" motion is more precisely described as a **dolly forward**.\n    *   The camera doesn't just raise its height; it moves vertically up. This is a **pedestal up** movement. The caption omits this specific term.\n*   **Missing Focus Terminology:** The instruction explicitly mentions `rack focus`. The caption describes a focus transition but fails to use this precise and correct term, instead mislabeling it as a transition \"to deep.\"\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption adheres well to the instruction to be concise. It correctly avoids mentioning absent features like video speed changes or lens distortion.\n*   **Terminology:** It uses some correct terms (`ground level`, `high/low angle`, `pan`, `tilt`, `shallow focus`). However, its failure to use more precise terms like `dolly`, `pedestal`, and `rack focus`—all of which are suggested in the instructions—and its incorrect use of `deep focus` show a partial adherence.\n*   **Structure:** The temporal description (\"After three seconds...\") is good and follows the instruction to describe complex movements in order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is **not good** because its central claim about the focus change is factually incorrect and misleads the viewer about the final state of the scene. While it successfully captures the general gist of the camera's path, it lacks the technical precision and completeness mandated by the detailed instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate, complete, and closely follows the instructions:\n\n**This is a single, continuous shot from a camera at ground level with a slight high angle. The video begins with a shallow depth of field, with the focus on the spiked grids in the midground. The camera then smoothly dollies forward and pedestals upward while simultaneously panning left and tilting up. This complex movement transitions the camera to a hip-level, low-angle view of a signal fence. During the tilt, a rack focus shifts the focus plane from the grids to the signal fence in the background.**",
