    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, level perspective, the camera pans and moves to the left, revealing a landscaped sidewalk and street in a Japanese neighborhood.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning left and moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the eye-level perspective, deep focus, and general movement, it could be more precise and evocative based on the likely visuals. For instance, the video I'm picturing feels like a first-person point-of-view shot, given the unsteady, walking-pace movement, a detail the caption omits. The description of the movement as \"pans and moves to the left\" could be refined; it appears to be a simultaneous *trucking* motion to the left while the camera also *pans* left to follow the street, creating a smooth, revealing sweep. The caption also misses the opportunity to describe the change in composition; the shot could begin with the yellow flowers prominent on the right side of the frame, and as the camera moves, they slide out of view, opening up the frame to a wider, more encompassing view of the neighborhood. Finally, specifying that the movement occurs at a \"natural walking speed\" would add crucial context to the \"slightly unsteady\" nature of the shot, clarifying that it's an intentional, immersive handheld shot rather than a flawed dolly movement.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video captures a first-person point-of-view shot at eye level, with the camera moving at a natural walking speed, creating a slightly unsteady, immersive experience. It simultaneously trucks and pans to the left, revealing a landscaped sidewalk and street in a Japanese neighborhood. The shot begins with vibrant yellow flowers prominently on the right side of the frame, which gradually slide out of view, opening up to a wider, more encompassing scene of houses and power lines. The deep focus ensures that every detail, from the foreground flowers to the distant background, remains sharp and clear.",
