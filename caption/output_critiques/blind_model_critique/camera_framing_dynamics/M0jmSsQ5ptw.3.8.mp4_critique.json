    "pre_caption": "This smooth, hip-level shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire outdoor scene sharp. The camera moves slightly forward before subtly panning left at the end of the video.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly moves forward and subtly pans left at the end of the video.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the detailed instructions, here is an evaluation of the provided caption for the video:\n\nThe caption is **good but could be improved** for greater accuracy and completeness. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot but mischaracterizes the primary camera movement and omits one required detail.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption:\n\n**Caption:** \"This smooth, hip-level shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire outdoor scene sharp. The camera moves slightly forward before subtly panning left at the end of the video.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **Accuracy: Mostly Accurate**\n\n*   **What it gets right:**\n    *   **\"smooth\"**: The camera movement is indeed very steady and smooth, likely achieved with a stabilizer.\n    *   **\"hip-level shot\"**: This is an accurate description of the camera's height.\n    *   **\"deep focus\"**: The caption correctly notes that the depth of field is deep, as both the foreground leaves and the background trees are in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"subtly panning left at the end\"**: This accurately describes the small rotational movement at the conclusion of the shot.\n\n*   **What could be more accurate:**\n    *   **\"moves slightly forward\"**: This is an understatement and misrepresents the primary motion. The camera's main action is a **continuous dolly forward** throughout the entire duration of the video, not just a slight movement.\n    *   **\"before subtly panning\"**: The word \"before\" implies the forward motion stops and is then followed by a pan. In the video, the pan occurs *during* the final moments of the continuous forward dolly.\n\n---\n\n#### **Completeness: Incomplete**\n\n*   The caption successfully covers **camera height**, **steadiness**, **focus**, and the **pan** movement.\n*   It correctly omits details about video speed and lens distortion, as they are standard/absent, adhering to the conciseness instruction.\n*   However, it is missing one required element:\n    *   **Camera Angle**: The caption fails to mention that the shot is filmed from a **level angle** (i.e., the camera is parallel to the ground).\n\n---\n\n#### **Adherence to Instructions: Good**\n\n*   The caption is concise and informative, as requested.\n*   It correctly describes multiple specified attributes (height, focus, movement).\n*   It follows the rule of not mentioning standard features like normal video speed.\n\n### Suggested Improvement\n\nHere is a revised caption that is more accurate and complete according to the instructions:\n\n**\"This smooth, hip-level shot is filmed at a level angle with a deep focus. The camera steadily dollies forward along the path, concluding with a subtle pan to the left.\"**\n\nThis revised version is better because it:\n1.  Adds the missing **\"level angle.\"**\n2.  More accurately describes the primary movement as a **\"steady dolly forward.\"**\n3.  Uses **\"concluding with\"** to better reflect the timing of the pan relative to the dolly.",
