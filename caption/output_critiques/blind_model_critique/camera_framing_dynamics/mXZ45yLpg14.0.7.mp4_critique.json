    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at a worm's-eye view, looking directly up at the trees. It then smoothly rolls counter-clockwise and gradually tilts down while panning right, transitioning to a level angle as it focuses on a person in a protective suit. The camera maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field throughout. Once the view is horizontal, the camera subtly moves backward, all with very smooth motion and no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a worm's-eye view angle (looking directly up) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera slightly rolls counter-clockwise, then gradually tilts down while panning right. Once the view returns to horizontal, it subtly moves backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent work on this caption. It is highly accurate and descriptive, capturing the complex camera movement with great precision.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance against the instructions:\n\n### Evaluation of the Caption\n\n**Accuracy: Excellent**\n*   **Starting Position:** \"worm's-eye view, looking directly up at the trees\" is perfectly accurate.\n*   **Complex Movement:** The description of the simultaneous \"rolls counter-clockwise,\" \"tilts down,\" and \"panning right\" is spot-on. This is a complex, compound movement, and the caption identifies all three axes of rotation correctly and in the right order of description.\n*   **Ending Position:** \"transitioning to a level angle as it focuses on a person in a protective suit\" is also correct.\n*   **Focus:** \"deep focus with a large depth of field throughout\" is an accurate assessment. The foreground leaves, the midground subject, and the background trees are all relatively sharp.\n*   **Final Movement & Steadiness:** \"subtly moves backward, all with very smooth motion and no shaking\" is entirely correct. The movement is subtle, backward, and exceptionally steady.\n\n**Completeness: Very Good**\nThe caption successfully covers most of the required elements:\n*   **Camera Angle:** Correctly identifies the transition from a worm's-eye to a level angle.\n*   **Movements:** Details the rotation (roll, tilt, pan) and translation (moves backward) with excellent clarity regarding speed, steadiness, and complexity.\n*   **Focus:** Accurately describes the depth of field.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor omissions based on the detailed instructions:\n*   **Camera Height:** The instruction asks to specify height (e.g., ground-level, eye-level). The caption describes the *angle* but not the corresponding *height*, which starts at **ground-level** and transitions to roughly **eye-level**.\n*   **Technical Terminology:** While \"moves backward\" is perfectly understandable and accurate, the instructions encourage the use of more technical terms like **\"dollying backward\"** or **\"dollying out.\"**\n\n**Adherence to Instructions: Excellent**\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise while remaining highly informative.\n*   **Omission of Unnecessary Details:** It correctly avoids mentioning video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as none of these are present in a notable way, adhering perfectly to the rule: \"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"\n*   **Chronological Order:** The description of movement follows the temporal sequence of the video, as requested.\n\n### Final Verdict\n\nThe caption is excellent and almost perfect. It demonstrates a strong understanding of camera mechanics and accurately translates the visual information into a clear, technical description. The only room for improvement is in adding the \"camera height\" and using the more specific term \"dolly\" to be 100% compliant with the detailed instructions.\n\n### Improved Version for Comparison\n\nHere is a revised version that incorporates the minor suggestions for full completeness:\n\n\"Starting at a **ground-level**, worm's-eye view of the trees, the camera smoothly rolls counter-clockwise while tilting down and panning right. This complex movement transitions the shot to a **level angle at roughly eye-level**, focusing on a person in a protective suit. The camera then subtly **dollies backward**. The entire shot is extremely steady and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field.\"",
