    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses an extremely shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, concise, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nEvery statement in the caption correctly describes a key visual element of the video:\n*   **\"low camera angle\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned below the keyboard, looking up, which defines a low angle.\n*   **\"varying Dutch angle due to camera rolling\"**: Perfectly accurate. The horizon (the line of the keyboard) is tilted, and this tilt changes throughout the shot, which is caused by the camera rolling on its axis.\n*   **\"extremely shallow depth of field, focusing on the midground\"**: Correct. The background (monitor) and immediate foreground are heavily blurred, while only the keys in the midground are in sharp focus.\n*   **\"camera moves smoothly forward and upward\"**: Correct. The camera performs a combination of a dolly-in (moving forward) and a pedestal-up (moving vertically).\n*   **\"maintaining minimal shaking\"**: Correct. The movement is very steady and controlled.\n\n### 2. Completeness (Adherence to Instructions)\nThe caption successfully includes all the necessary information while omitting what is not required:\n*   **Covers Key Configurations**: It correctly identifies and describes the angle, movement, steadiness, focus, and depth of field.\n*   **Identifies Non-Default Features**: It correctly points out the Dutch angle, the specific type of movement, and the shallow depth of field.\n*   **Obeys Conciseness Rule**: As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is normal), **lens distortion** (which is absent), and **shot transitions** (as there is only one shot). This makes the description efficient and focused.\n\n### 3. Clarity and Conciseness\nThe caption uses clear, descriptive language that is easy to understand. It avoids overly technical jargon where simpler terms suffice (e.g., \"moves forward and upward\" instead of \"dollies in and pedestals up\"), yet it uses precise terms where necessary (\"varying Dutch angle,\" \"extremely shallow depth of field\"). It condenses a comprehensive analysis into a single, effective sentence.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is precise, thorough in its coverage of relevant details, and commendably concise.",
