    "pre_caption": "This video, shot with a very smooth drone camera, exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera begins at an aerial level and has a varying Dutch angle as it rolls. It uses a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp.\n\nThe camera tracks a boat moving forward on a wide river. Starting from behind and above, the camera flies forward and descends while arcing counter-clockwise around the boat. As it arcs, the camera tilts upward, leveling its angle to position itself at the front of the boat, which grows larger in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an aerial level and then moves above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The drone camera tracks a boat moving forward in a wide river from an aerial perspective, initially looking downward. It starts from behind and above the boat, smoothly flies forward and descends while arcing counterclockwise around it. As it arcs, the camera tilts upward, gradually leveling its angle and positioning itself at the front of the boat at the same height.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is tracking the subject while arcing around them. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is exceptionally well-written, accurate, and adheres perfectly to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is concise yet packed with accurate technical detail. It successfully deconstructs a complex, continuous camera movement into its constituent parts and describes them in a clear, logical sequence.\n\n### Feedback on Accuracy\n\nThe caption is highly accurate in every detail:\n\n*   **\"very smooth drone camera\"**: This correctly identifies the type of equipment used (implied by the movement) and its key characteristic—flawless stability.\n*   **\"mild barrel distortion\"**: This is a precise observation. The horizon and straight lines near the edges show a slight outward curve, which is typical of wide-angle drone lenses but is not as extreme as a fisheye.\n*   **\"aerial level\" and \"descends\"**: The camera starts high above the landscape and clearly loses altitude throughout the shot.\n*   **\"varying Dutch angle as it rolls\"**: This is an expert-level observation. The shot begins with a noticeable tilt, and the camera performs a roll maneuver to level the horizon by the end of the clip.\n*   **\"deep focus\"**: Correct. The boat in the midground, the water in the foreground, and the mountains in the background are all in sharp focus.\n*   **Movement Description**: The breakdown of the movement is perfect:\n    *   **\"tracks a boat\"**: This correctly identifies the primary purpose of the movement.\n    *   **\"Starting from behind and above\"**: Accurately sets the initial framing.\n    *   **\"flies forward and descends while arcing counter-clockwise\"**: This brilliantly combines three simultaneous movements (dollying forward, pedestaling down, and arcing) into one fluid description.\n    *   **\"tilts upward, leveling its angle\"**: This correctly describes the camera's rotation on its vertical axis, moving from a high-angle view to a more level-angle view.\n    *   **\"boat... grows larger in the frame\"**: This is the correct way to describe the effect of the camera moving closer, wisely avoiding the incorrect term \"zooming.\"\n\n### Feedback on Completeness\n\nThe caption successfully addresses all relevant points from the instructions:\n\n*   **Video Speed**: Omitted, which is correct because the video is at regular speed.\n*   **Lens Distortion**: Included and described accurately.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height**: Included, along with their changes over time.\n*   **Dutch Angle & Roll**: Included and described perfectly.\n*   **Movements**: Comprehensively covered, including type (tracking, arcing, descending, flying forward, tilting, rolling), steadiness (smooth), and purpose (tracking).\n*   **Focus**: Included and described accurately.\n\n### Feedback on Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions flawlessly:\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative**: It avoids unnecessary words while providing a rich, technical description.\n*   **Correct Omissions**: It correctly leaves out details for standard configurations (e.g., normal speed), as instructed.\n*   **Logical Structure**: It separates the static configurations (distortion, focus) from the dynamic camera movement, making the description easy to follow.\n*   **Use of Terminology**: It uses precise technical terms like `barrel distortion`, `Dutch angle`, `rolls`, `deep focus`, `tracks`, `arcing`, and `tilts` correctly and effectively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is of outstanding quality. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of cinematography and the ability to translate complex visual information into a precise, well-structured, and compliant written description. There are no improvements to suggest.",
