    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is panning right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a highly accurate and well-structured description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\n**1. Accuracy: Excellent**\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The description of \"mild barrel distortion\" is spot-on. The vertical lines of the window frames and the wall on the left subtly curve outward, which is the exact definition of barrel distortion.\n*   **Camera Position:** \"Eye level\" and \"level angle\" are correct. The perspective is natural and not from an unusually high or low viewpoint, and the horizon is perfectly horizontal.\n*   **Focus:** \"Deep focus for a large depth of field\" is accurate. The couch in the foreground, the table in the midground, and the windows in the background are all in sharp focus simultaneously.\n*   **Movement:** \"Smoothly pans right with minimal shaking\" is a precise description. The camera rotates horizontally from left to right in a single, fluid motion. The stability is very high, so \"minimal shaking\" is a correct and safe assessment (it could even be described as having no perceptible shaking).\n\n**2. Completeness: Excellent**\n*   The caption successfully identifies and describes all the relevant visual characteristics present in the video: lens distortion, camera height, camera angle, focus, and camera movement.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present, following the instruction's guidance on conciseness. For example, it doesn't mention:\n    *   **Video Speed:** Because it's at a regular, real-time speed.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** Because the camera is not tilted.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** Because the focus is static.\n    *   **Complex Movements:** Because the only movement is a simple pan.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** Because the video is a single, continuous shot.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** The caption packs a significant amount of technical information into two clear, concise sentences. It avoids unnecessary words while covering all the required points.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the specific vocabulary requested in the instructions, such as \"barrel distortion,\" \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" \"deep focus,\" and \"pans.\"\n*   **Structure:** The description is logically organized, first addressing the static properties of the shot (lens, position, focus) before describing the dynamic movement.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is unambiguous and easy to understand for anyone familiar with the provided terms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is an exemplary model of how to follow the given instructions. It is accurate in its analysis of the video, complete in its coverage of the relevant features, and perfectly adheres to the rules of conciseness and terminology specified in the prompt. It is an excellent caption for this video.",
