    "pre_caption": "This is a time-lapse video shot from a high position on top of a container, between an overhead and aerial level, with a level angle. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera moves quickly and smoothly forward while simultaneously panning to the left. A deep focus keeps the entire scene, from the containers in the foreground to the starry sky and distant horizon, sharp and clear.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A time-lapse video played forward at a greatly accelerated speed (more than 3× real-time), showing time passing rapidly over a long period.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion where lines near the frame edges bow slightly outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is positioned on top of a container, at a height between the overhead level and the aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and panning left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving quickly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the time-lapse, lens distortion, and the basic camera movement, it could be more precise and evocative. The description of the camera position as \"between an overhead and aerial level\" is ambiguous; a more accurate term like \"high-level\" or \"crane-level\" would clarify that the camera is mounted high up but not necessarily airborne. Furthermore, describing the shot as a \"level angle\" seems unlikely; given the high vantage point and the mention of foreground containers, the camera is almost certainly at a \"high angle,\" looking down slightly to capture both the ground elements and the horizon. The most significant omission is the visual effect of the time-lapse itself: the \"starry sky\" would not just be \"sharp and clear\" but would feature prominent, arcing star trails, a defining characteristic of a nighttime time-lapse. The movement, a combination of a forward dolly and a left pan, could be more descriptively termed a \"sweeping arc,\" which better conveys the purpose of revealing the vast expanse of the container port and the sky. Finally, the deep focus is well-noted, but the description misses the dynamic motion of other elements, such as the rapid movement of clouds or the blurred lights of distant vehicles and ships, which would be key features in such a scene.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "This time-lapse video captures a sweeping arc shot from a high-level position, akin to a crane-level view, providing a dynamic perspective over the container port. The camera, positioned at a high angle, smoothly moves forward while panning left, revealing the vast expanse below. The lens exhibits mild barrel distortion, adding a subtle curvature to the scene. The deep focus ensures clarity from the containers in the foreground to the distant horizon. The starry sky features prominent, arcing star trails, a hallmark of nighttime time-lapse photography. The scene is animated by the rapid movement of clouds and the blurred lights of distant vehicles and ships, enhancing the sense of motion and scale.",
