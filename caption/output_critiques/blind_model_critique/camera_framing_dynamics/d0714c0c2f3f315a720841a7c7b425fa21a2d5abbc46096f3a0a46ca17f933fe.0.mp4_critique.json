    "pre_caption": "This slow-motion video is captured from a shaky, eye-level perspective. The camera moves forward slowly, tracking a woman carrying a bucket of flowers from behind. A deep focus is used, keeping the woman and the surrounding flower field sharp. As the camera follows her, the woman gradually becomes smaller in the frame.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is following the subject from behind. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes smaller in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "The caption's description contains a significant contradiction: if the camera is \"tracking\" the woman, her size in the frame should remain relatively constant, yet the caption states she \"gradually becomes smaller.\" It would be more accurate to describe this as the camera dollying forward at a slower speed than the subject, creating a sense of gentle departure, or as a static shot where she is simply walking away from the camera. The claim of \"deep focus\" is also questionable for what sounds like a cinematic scene; it's more likely the video uses a *shallow depth of field* to artistically isolate the woman against the blurred background of the flower field, keeping only her and the immediate foreground sharp. The description of movement is overly simplified; the \"shaky\" quality could be more specifically defined as a \"gentle handheld wobble,\" and the camera might also be performing a subtle *counter-clockwise arc* to reveal more of the landscape as it follows her. Lastly, the caption omits the camera angle, which is likely a *level angle*, and fails to mention the potential for slight *barrel distortion* if a wide-angle lens was used to capture the vastness of the field.",
