    "pre_caption": "The video exhibits mild barrel distortion. The camera is positioned at eye level, employing a low angle, and maintains a deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves backward and downward, leading the subject (a skier) from the front with smooth, minimally shaky movement.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward and moving down.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption correctly identifies the backward dolly movement and deep focus, it misses several key dynamic elements and contains some ambiguity. The description of the camera as being at \"eye level\" while using a \"low angle\" is confusing; in the video, the camera appears to be mounted at chest-level and angled slightly upward toward the skier's face, creating a more heroic perspective rather than a true eye-level shot. The movement is also more complex than just moving backward; the camera actively pans left and right to track the skier's turns and even performs a slight counter-clockwise arc as they navigate a wide curve in the slope. Most importantly, the caption fails to mention a significant speed ramp where the video transitions from real-time to slow-motion as the skier kicks up a large plume of snow, emphasizing the moment's impact before returning to normal speed. Finally, while the \"mild barrel distortion\" is noted, it would be more informative to attribute it to the use of a wide-angle lens, which is evident from the expansive peripheral view of the surrounding trees and mountains.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases dynamic camera work with a wide-angle lens, evident from the expansive view of the surrounding trees and mountains, which introduces mild barrel distortion. The camera is mounted at chest level and angled slightly upward, creating a heroic perspective as it follows the skier. It moves backward while actively panning left and right to track the skier's turns, and performs a slight counter-clockwise arc as the skier navigates a wide curve. The deep focus is maintained throughout. A significant speed ramp occurs when the skier kicks up a large plume of snow, transitioning from real-time to slow-motion to emphasize the moment's impact before returning to normal speed.",
