    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is rolling counterclockwise and moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption effectively captures the primary movements and focus, it could be more precise and descriptive. The description of a \"forward\" movement might be an oversimplification; for instance, the camera could be simultaneously *arcing* slightly to the left around the foot of the bed to create a more dynamic reveal of the sleeping woman, a detail the current caption misses. The term \"hip-level\" is a good start, but it doesn't specify if the camera is also *pedestaling* upward as it moves, which would create a floating or rising sensation that enhances the dreamlike mood. Furthermore, the description of the focus is static. As the camera dollies closer to the woman, a continuous *focus pull* would be necessary to keep her sharp. The caption should note this dynamic *focus tracking* on the midground subject. Finally, the caption omits the initial camera angle (e.g., a *level angle*) and the potential use of *slow-motion*, which would be a key contributor to the surreal or intimate atmosphere of watching someone sleep. Adding that the roll creates a Dutch angle that progresses from 0 to roughly 30 degrees would also provide a more quantitative sense of the disorientation.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "Starting from a level angle at hip height, the camera moves in a smooth, arcing motion slightly to the left around the foot of the bed, creating a dynamic reveal of the woman sleeping. As it progresses, the camera subtly pedestals upward, enhancing the dreamlike mood with a floating sensation. The camera rolls counterclockwise, gradually creating a Dutch angle that shifts from 0 to approximately 30 degrees, adding to the disorientation. A shallow depth of field is maintained with continuous focus tracking, ensuring the woman remains sharp as the camera dollies closer. The use of slow-motion further contributes to the surreal and intimate atmosphere of the scene.",
