    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption:\n\nThe caption is **partially accurate but contains significant errors** regarding the camera's position and focus. While it correctly identifies the static nature of the shot and the shallow depth of field, it mischaracterizes the camera's height, angle, and focal plane.\n\n### Detailed Feedback:\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Height (\"eye level\"): Incorrect.** The camera is positioned above the subject's head, looking down. A more accurate description would be **slightly elevated** or **shoulder-level**. \"Eye level\" would imply the camera is at the same height as the subject's eyes, which it is not.\n    *   **Camera Angle (\"level angle\"): Incorrect.** The camera is clearly tilted downwards to capture the subject and their laptop. This is a **high angle**, not a level one.\n    *   **Depth of Field (\"shallow depth of field\"): Correct.** The background is significantly blurred, isolating the subject and their workspace, which is characteristic of a shallow depth of field.\n    *   **Focus Plane (\"focused on the foreground\"): Inaccurate.** The primary subject (the person's hands and the laptop) is in the **midground**. While a small portion of the desk in the foreground is also in focus, the main point of interest is clearly the midground.\n    *   **Movement (\"completely static\"): Correct.** The camera does not move, shake, or wobble in any way, indicating it is on a stable mount like a tripod.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   The caption adheres well to the conciseness rule by correctly omitting mentions of video speed (which is normal), lens distortion (none is visible), and Dutch angle (the frame is level).\n    *   It attempts to cover all the required static elements (height, angle, focus, movement), but fails on the accuracy of several key points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe caption fails to provide an accurate description of the camera's configuration. The errors in describing the height, angle, and focus plane create a misleading picture of how the shot was framed.\n\n### Corrected Caption:\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately follows the instructions:\n\n**From a slightly elevated, high angle, the static camera captures a subject at a desk. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the person and their laptop in the midground in sharp focus while blurring the background.**",
