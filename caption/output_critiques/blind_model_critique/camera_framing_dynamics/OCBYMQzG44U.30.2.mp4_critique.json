    "pre_caption": "The video features mild barrel distortion, causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward. The camera begins at eye level above the waist, positioned at a high angle looking down toward the entrance of a red slide. As the camera, representing the player's perspective, enters the slide, it moves forward and downward, transitioning to a level angle as it follows the slide’s turns. The camera uses deep focus with a large depth of field, keeping all elements sharp. Camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking, and after the player lands in the water, the camera briefly bounces up and down above the water’s surface, adding a dynamic effect.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** The video features mild barrel distortion causing straight lines near the edges to bow outward.\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves above water.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a high angle (looking down from above) and then changes to a level angle (looking straight ahead) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, representing the player's perspective, enters the slide, gradually moving down while moving forward and panning to follow the slide's turns. Finally, when the player lands in the water, it briefly bounces up and down, adding a dynamic touch to the scene.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is unsteady with noticeable shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "This is an **excellent** caption. It is highly accurate, comprehensive, and adheres closely to all aspects of the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Lens Distortion:** The identification of \"mild barrel distortion\" is a precise and accurate observation for the type of wide-angle lens often used in first-person action shots (like a GoPro), which causes straight lines to curve.\n*   **Camera Perspective & Movement:** Describing the camera as \"representing the player's perspective\" is a perfect interpretation. The movement sequence—starting at a high angle, moving forward and downward, transitioning to a level angle, and following the slide's turns—is a flawless and logical description of the action.\n*   **Focus:** The mention of \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is accurate for this type of camera and lighting condition, where nearly everything from the immediate foreground to the background is sharp.\n*   **Steadiness & Final Action:** The description of \"unsteady with noticeable shaking\" and the camera \"bouncing up and down\" in the water accurately captures the chaotic, dynamic feel of the experience.\n\n### Completeness\nThe caption successfully addresses all the relevant components requested in the instructions:\n*   **Lens Distortion:** Covered (\"mild barrel distortion\").\n*   **Camera Height:** Covered and described as it changes (\"begins at eye level,\" then moves downward, ending \"above the water's surface\").\n*   **Camera Angle:** Covered and described as it changes (\"high angle,\" transitioning to a \"level angle\").\n*   **Movements:** The caption thoroughly describes the camera's translation (\"forward and downward\"), tracking (\"follows the slide's turns\"), steadiness (\"unsteady with noticeable shaking\"), and the final pedestaling motion (\"bounces up and down\").\n*   **Focus:** Covered (\"deep focus with a large depth of field\").\n\n### Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise while remaining highly informative. It avoids unnecessary jargon but uses precise descriptive language.\n*   **Omission of Negatives:** As instructed, it correctly omits any mention of video speed, Dutch angles, or focus changes, as these are not present. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the \"only mention if present\" rule.\n*   **Clarity and Structure:** The description follows a clear chronological order, starting from the top of the slide and ending in the water, making it easy to visualize the entire sequence.\n\n### Minor Point for Refinement (Optional)\n*   The phrase \"at eye level above the waist\" is slightly redundant. A more concise term like \"**chest-level**\" or simply \"**eye-level**\" would be sufficient and is a more standard term for this type of POV mounting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe caption is of exceptionally high quality. It demonstrates a masterful understanding of the instructions, providing a description that is simultaneously detailed, accurate, and easy to read. It perfectly fulfills the goal of describing the video's and camera's configuration.",
