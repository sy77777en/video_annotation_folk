    "pre_caption": "This hip-level, level-angle shot begins with a shallow depth of field, leaving the scene out of focus.

    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a hip level (below the waist and above the knees).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The indoor scene begins with a shallow depth of field, initially out of focus. As a person enters the frame, they briefly come into focus, but as they walk into the background, they become out of focus again, leaving the entire scene blurred. The camera continues panning left, revealing a blurry foreground and a slightly clearer part of the door in the middleground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is very good and provides a high-quality description that aligns well with the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of its performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\nThe caption is accurate, concise, and informative. It successfully captures the key technical and stylistic elements of the video as required by the detailed instructions.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n*   **Accuracy:**\n    *   **Camera Configuration:** The identification of the shot as \"hip-level\" and \"level-angle\" is correct. The camera is positioned low and aimed straight, not tilted up or down.\n    *   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The description of the focus is highly accurate. It correctly notes the initial out-of-focus state, the use of a \"shallow depth of field,\" the brief moment the person is in focus, and how they blur again as they move into the background. The final observation that the scene remains out of focus is also correct.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The caption correctly identifies the \"smoothly pans left\" movement. The pan is steady and moves horizontally from right to left.\n\n*   **Completeness & Adherence to Instructions:**\n    *   **Required Elements:** The caption successfully covers all the relevant aspects mentioned in the instructions:\n        *   **Camera Height:** \"hip-level\"\n        *   **Camera Angle:** \"level-angle\"\n        *   **Focus/Depth:** \"shallow depth of field,\" \"out of focus,\" \"briefly come into focus\"\n        *   **Movement:** \"smoothly pans left\"\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption adheres to the instruction to be concise. It correctly omits any mention of video speed, lens distortion, or Dutch angle, as these are all at their default settings (regular speed, no distortion, level horizon).\n    *   **Temporal Order:** The description follows the sequence of events in the video logically: it starts with the initial focus state, describes the subject's action and the corresponding focus change, and concludes with the camera's panning movement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematographic terms and applies them accurately to the video. It fulfills all requirements of the prompt by providing a description that is simultaneously detailed and succinct. No significant changes are needed.",
