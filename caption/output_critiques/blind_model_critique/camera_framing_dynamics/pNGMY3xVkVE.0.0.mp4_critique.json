    "pre_caption": "The video is in slow motion, with the camera positioned at eye level and maintaining a level angle. It uses deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field. The camera smoothly moves forward, following the group of people walking through the tunnel, with minimal shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. The caption is a high-quality and accurate description that perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why the caption is so effective:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is accurate, concise, and informative, successfully capturing all the key technical and stylistic elements of the video as required by the detailed instructions. It demonstrates a strong understanding of cinematography terms and applies them correctly.\n\n### Feedback Breakdown\n\n**1. Accuracy:** Every statement in the caption is a correct observation of the video.\n\n*   **\"The video is in slow motion...\"**: Correct. The movement of the people and the camera is deliberately slowed down for stylistic effect.\n*   **\"...with the camera positioned at eye level and maintaining a level angle.\"**: Correct. The camera is held at a height typical of a person's perspective, and the horizon is not tilted.\n*   **\"It uses deep focus, ensuring a large depth of field.\"**: Correct. Both the people in the midground and the tunnel extending into the background are in sharp focus, indicating a large depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera smoothly moves forward, following the group of people...\"**: Correct. The camera performs a forward dolly/tracking shot, keeping pace with the subjects. The movement is very fluid.\n*   **\"...with minimal shaking.\"**: Correct. The shot is very stable, suggesting the use of a gimbal or other stabilization equipment.\n\n**2. Completeness:** The caption is comprehensive without being verbose. It includes all the necessary information while correctly omitting irrelevant details.\n\n*   **Included Elements:** It correctly identifies and describes the video speed, camera height, camera angle, focus/depth of field, and camera movement (type, steadiness, and purpose).\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Lens Distortion & Dutch Angle:** The video has no noticeable lens distortion or tilted angle, so per the instructions (\"there is no need to mention these\"), they were correctly omitted for conciseness.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to describe a rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n\n**3. Adherence to Instructions:** The caption follows the instructions precisely.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a significant amount of information into a single, well-structured sentence.\n*   **Specific Terminology:** It uses appropriate terms like \"slow motion,\" \"eye level,\" \"level angle,\" and \"deep focus.\"\n*   **Movement Description:** It clearly describes the movement's direction (\"forward\"), purpose (\"following the group\"), and quality (\"smoothly,\" \"minimal shaking\"), which aligns perfectly with the instructions.\n*   **Clarity:** The language is clear and easy to understand, even for someone not deeply familiar with film terminology. The phrase \"ensuring a large depth of field\" is a great example of providing context for a technical term (\"deep focus\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is a perfect blend of technical accuracy, completeness, and conciseness, resulting in a description that is both efficient and highly descriptive. No improvements are needed.",
