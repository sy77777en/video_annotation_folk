    "pre_caption": "This shot uses a deep focus, keeping the entire rural landscape, from the hay bale in the foreground to the camper van in the mid-ground, sharp. The camera begins at a level, eye-level height and then smoothly pedestals upward, transitioning to an overhead view of the scene.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera starts at an eye level (above the waist) and then moves to an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Feedback on the Caption\n\nThe caption is good and captures the main elements of the shot, but it can be improved for greater accuracy and completeness according to the detailed instructions.\n\n**Overall Judgment:** A good attempt that is concise and mostly accurate, but it misidentifies the starting camera angle and simplifies the camera's movement and position transition.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Focus:** The description of a **deep focus** is perfect. The caption correctly identifies that the entire scene, from the foreground hay bale to the mid-ground van and background landscape, remains sharp.\n    *   **Movement Type:** Identifying the movement as a **\"smoothly pedestals upward\"** is accurate. The camera moves vertically in a steady, controlled manner.\n    *   **Final View:** The description of the final shot as an **\"overhead view\"** is correct.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate:**\n    *   **Starting Camera Angle & Height:** The caption states the camera begins at a **\"level, eye-level height.\"** This is incorrect.\n        *   **Angle:** The camera is clearly pointed slightly upward toward the van at the beginning, making it a **low angle**, not a level one.\n        *   **Height:** The starting height is closer to **hip-level** or slightly above, not eye-level. An eye-level shot would be positioned higher and likely have a more level angle on the van.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Covered Well:**\n    *   The caption effectively describes the **focus** and the primary **camera movement**.\n\n*   **What's Missing or Simplified:**\n    *   **Angle Transition:** The caption simplifies the angle change by only mentioning the start (\"level\") and end (\"overhead\"). A more complete description would note the full transition: the camera moves from a **low angle**, passes through a **level angle** and a **high angle**, and settles on a **bird's-eye view**.\n    *   **Movement Qualities:** While \"smoothly\" is included, other qualities like **speed (moderate and constant)** are omitted.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** The video exhibits very minimal wide-angle lens distortion, which is common for drone cameras. While omitting this adheres to the conciseness rule (as it's not a prominent effect like fisheye), a highly technical description could briefly mention it.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise and easy to read.\n    *   **Omission of Normals:** It correctly follows the instruction to not mention normal video speed, the absence of lens distortion (as it's negligible), or the lack of a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Focus and Movement:** It successfully incorporates descriptions of focus and movement as requested.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary failure in adherence is the inaccuracy of the starting camera position, which is a key element requested in the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Revised, More Accurate Caption\n\nHere is an example of a caption that is more accurate and complete while still remaining concise:\n\n**\"This shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp. The camera begins at a low, hip-level height with a low angle on the camper van, then performs a smooth and steady pedestal straight up, transitioning through a high angle to a final bird's-eye view of the rural landscape.\"**",
