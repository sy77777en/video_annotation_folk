    "pre_caption": "The video features a speed ramp effect, smoothly transitioning between fast and slow speeds. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, around second-floor height, with a high angle looking down. It begins with deep focus on a group of people playing basketball. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to a basketball in the foreground, which remains sharp and clear, while the people in the background become heavily blurred, likely due to a post-production effect. The camera remains completely static throughout, with no movement or shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A video with a speed ramp effect where playback speed smoothly transitions between fast and slow.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video begins with deep focus, transitioning from a group of people playing basketball to a basketball. The basketball in the foreground is sharp and clear, while the people in the background are heavily blurred, likely as a post-production effect.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, very comprehensive, and adheres almost perfectly to the provided instructions. It successfully captures the key technical and stylistic elements of the video in a concise and informative way.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### **Accuracy: Excellent**\n\nThe caption accurately identifies and describes nearly all the visual information.\n\n*   **Speed Ramp:** Correctly identifies the video's primary effect as a \"speed ramp\" that transitions between fast and slow motion.\n*   **Camera Position:** The description of \"overhead level, around second-floor height, with a high angle\" is a precise and accurate assessment of the camera's placement.\n*   **Focus Shift:** The description of the focus change is spot-on. It correctly notes the shift from an initial deep focus to a shallow depth of field focused on the foreground basketball.\n*   **Artificial Blur:** The observation that the heavy blur is \"likely due to a post-production effect\" is a sophisticated and accurate analysis. The blur is too uniform and extreme to be a simple optical rack focus, suggesting digital manipulation.\n*   **Camera Movement:** Correctly states that the camera is \"completely static.\"\n\nThe only minor point of potential ambiguity is in the phrase \"deep focus on a group of people.\" While the people are the subject, \"deep focus\" technically means the entire scene (foreground, midground, and background) is in focus. A more precise phrasing might be: \"It begins with deep focus, keeping the entire court and the players sharp.\" However, this is a very minor critique, and the current wording is easily understood.\n\n#### **Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe caption is very complete and covers all the relevant points from the instructions without adding unnecessary fluff.\n\n*   **Required Elements:** It successfully addresses video speed, camera angle, camera height, camera movement (or lack thereof), and focus dynamics (depth, plane, and changes).\n*   **Omitted Elements:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits descriptions of elements that are not present, such as lens distortion, Dutch angles, or complex camera movements (panning, tilting, etc.). This demonstrates a good understanding of the \"concise\" requirement.\n*   **Transitions:** Since there are no cuts, it correctly describes the action within a single, continuous shot.\n\n#### **Adherence to Instruction: Excellent**\n\nThe caption demonstrates a clear and successful effort to follow every part of the detailed instructions.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** It specifies the exact type of speed alteration (\"speed ramp\") as requested.\n*   **Camera Configuration:** It provides a concise description of the camera's height (\"overhead level\") and angle (\"high angle\").\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** It uses the specified terminology (\"deep focus,\" \"foreground,\" \"background,\" \"blurred\") and correctly identifies the dynamic focus shift.\n*   **Camera Movement:** It follows the instruction to simply state the shot is \"static\" when there is no movement.\n*   **Conciseness:** The description is efficient and avoids redundancy, fulfilling the goal of being \"concise yet informative.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a model caption that perfectly aligns with the given instructions. It is analytical, precise, and well-written. There are no significant errors, and the minor point on the phrasing of \"deep focus\" is a matter of nuance rather than a mistake. The author of the caption clearly understood both the video's technical aspects and the requirements of the prompt.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "The video showcases a speed ramp effect, seamlessly transitioning between fast and slow motion. The camera is positioned at an overhead level, approximately second-floor height, with a high angle looking down. It starts with deep focus, keeping the entire court and the players sharp. As the video progresses, the focus shifts to a basketball in the foreground, which remains sharp and clear, while the people in the background become heavily blurred, likely due to a post-production effect. The camera remains completely static throughout, with no movement or shaking.",
