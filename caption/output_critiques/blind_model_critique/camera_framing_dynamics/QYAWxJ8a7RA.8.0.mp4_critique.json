    "pre_caption": "The video begins with the camera at ground level, looking straight ahead. It smoothly moves forward while tilting up, transitioning from a level to a low angle. Initially, the focus is on the midground, capturing details like the ground texture. As the camera progresses, a slow rack focus shifts attention to the background, highlighting structures like the tree and buildings. The movement is steady and fluid throughout.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at a ground level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is initially at a level angle (looking straight ahead) and then changes to a low angle (looking up from below) due to camera motion.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera starts focused on the midground, and later becomes focused on the background. The focus plane changes through a slow rack focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward and tilting up.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good** but could be improved for greater technical accuracy and completeness. It correctly identifies several key aspects of the shot, such as the starting position, angle change, and the rack focus. However, it mischaracterizes the primary camera movement, which is a key element.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** The description of the camera starting at `ground level` and transitioning from a `level` to a `low angle` is perfectly accurate.\n    *   **Focus:** The identification of the initial focus on the `midground` (ground texture) and the subsequent `slow rack focus` to the `background` (tree and buildings) is precise and well-described. This is the strongest part of the caption.\n    *   **Steadiness:** Describing the movement as `steady` and `fluid` is correct. The motion is perfectly smooth, likely because it is computer-generated.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Imprecise:**\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The description \"moves forward while tilting up\" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.\n        *   The camera doesn't just tilt; its entire position elevates vertically. This is a **pedestal up** movement.\n        *   The forward motion is a **dolly forward**.\n        *   When a camera performs a complex move involving vertical lift (pedestal) and horizontal movement (dolly), the most accurate and concise term is a **crane** movement. The caption misses this key technical term, which is specifically mentioned in the instructions.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Primary Movement Type:** As mentioned above, the caption omits the more precise terms `pedestal`, `dolly`, or the all-encompassing term `crane`. The instructions specifically ask for these terms to be used.\n    *   **Depth of Field:** While the caption correctly describes the *change* in focus (rack focus), it doesn't explicitly state that the shot maintains a **shallow depth of field** throughout, which is a defining characteristic of the video's aesthetic.\n\n*   **What's Handled Well:**\n    *   The caption correctly adheres to the instruction to be concise by omitting details that are not present (e.g., regular video speed, no lens distortion, no Dutch angle).\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption successfully uses specific terminology from the instructions, such as `ground level`, `low angle`, and `rack focus`.\n    *   It follows the requested structure by describing the configuration, movement, and focus.\n    *   It is concise and informative.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   The primary weakness is the failure to use the most appropriate terms for camera movement (`pedestal`, `crane`) that are explicitly listed in the instructions. Describing the movement as a \"crane\" shot would be both more accurate and more in line with the detailed requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is an example of a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\n**\"The shot begins at ground-level with a level angle, then performs a smooth crane movement, simultaneously dollying forward and pedestaling upward. This motion causes the camera to tilt up, transitioning to a low angle. The video uses a shallow depth of field, starting with the focus on the midground texture before executing a slow rack focus to shift attention to the buildings and tree in the background.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **More Precise Movement:** It uses the term **\"crane movement\"** and breaks it down into **\"dollying forward and pedestaling upward,\"** which is a technically exact description of what is happening.\n*   **More Complete:** It explicitly mentions the **\"shallow depth of field,\"** a key visual element of the entire shot.\n*   **Clear Cause and Effect:** It clarifies that the **\"tilt up\"** is a result of the crane motion needed to keep the subject in frame.\n*   **High Adherence:** This version fully utilizes the specific vocabulary and descriptive depth requested in the instructions.",
