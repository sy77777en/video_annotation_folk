    "pre_caption": "From a smooth, high-angle, overhead perspective, the camera maintains a deep focus while tracking a moving car. The camera moves backward at a 45-degree angle relative to the street, and midway through the shot, the frame's center shifts upward to focus on the car's roof.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an overhead level (around second floor height).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera tracks a moving car from a high-angle perspective, moving backward at a 45-degree angle relative to the street. Midway through the video, the frame center moves up to the top of the car.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It successfully identifies several key cinematic elements like the camera angle, movement, and focus. However, it contains some minor inaccuracies, imprecise terminology, and redundancies that could be improved for greater clarity and adherence to the instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What the caption gets right:**\n    *   **\"smooth\"**: The camera movement is indeed very stable and smooth, likely achieved with a gimbal or drone.\n    *   **\"high-angle\"**: This is correct. The camera is positioned significantly above the subject.\n    *   **\"deep focus\"**: Correct. The car, the road, and the background elements are all in sharp focus.\n    *   **\"tracking a moving car\"**: Correct. The camera's primary purpose is to follow the car's movement.\n    *   **\"moves backward at a 45-degree angle relative to the street\"**: This is an excellent and accurate description of the camera's translational movement (a combination of dollying back and trucking left).\n\n*   **What the caption gets wrong or could state more accurately:**\n    *   **\"overhead perspective\"**: This is inaccurate and redundant next to \"high-angle.\" An overhead shot is typically a 90-degree, top-down view (like a map). This shot is clearly at an angle (around 45-60 degrees), making \"high-angle\" the correct term. Including both is contradictory.\n    *   **\"the frame's center shifts upward to focus on the car's roof\"**: This phrasing is confusing because it incorrectly links a change in framing with a change in **focus**. The focus remains deep and constant throughout. The movement described is a **slight tilt up** of the camera to adjust the framing and keep the car centered as the camera's position changes relative to it.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What the caption covers well:**\n    *   It correctly identifies the **camera angle**, **steadiness**, primary **movement type** (tracking), **movement direction**, and **focus depth**.\n\n*   **What the caption is missing:**\n    *   **Camera Height**: While \"high-angle\" implies height, the instructions ask for a specific description like *aerial-level*, which would be more precise here as the shot is likely from a drone.\n    *   **Specific Movement Terminology**: The description of the upward shift would be more complete and professional if it used the term **tilt**, as suggested in the instructions.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   The caption is **concise** and correctly omits details about normal video speed and the absence of lens distortion, as instructed.\n    *   It successfully describes multiple aspects of the camera's configuration (angle, movement, focus).\n\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   It fails to use the most precise terminology for all movements. The instructions specifically list \"tilting,\" which should have been used instead of the more ambiguous \"the frame's center shifts upward.\"\n    *   The description of the camera angle (\"high-angle, overhead perspective\") is not as clear as it could be, violating the goal of being \"informative.\"\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to the instructions:\n\n**From a smooth, high-angle aerial perspective, the camera maintains deep focus as it tracks a moving car. The camera moves diagonally backward, parallel to the car's path, and performs a slight, gradual tilt upward to keep the vehicle centered in the frame.**",
