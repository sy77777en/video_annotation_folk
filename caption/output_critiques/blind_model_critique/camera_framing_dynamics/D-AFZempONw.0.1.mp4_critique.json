    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera height is unclear or not significant enough to mention (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a low angle (looking up from below).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. Here is a detailed analysis of the provided caption based on your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **very good**. It is accurate, concise, and captures the most essential cinematic elements of the shot as required by the instructions. It successfully balances being informative with being brief.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**. Every statement it makes correctly describes the video.\n\n*   **\"Shot from a low angle...\"**: Correct. The camera is positioned below the subject's eye line, looking up, which makes the figure appear more imposing.\n*   **\"...the camera focuses on a cybernetic figure in the foreground...\"**: Correct. The subject is a cybernetic figure, it is positioned in the foreground, and it is the clear plane of focus.\n*   **\"...utilizing a shallow depth of field.\"**: Correct. The subject is sharp and in focus, while the background elements are significantly blurred, which is the definition of a shallow depth of field.\n*   **\"The camera performs a smooth, minor backward movement.\"**: Correct. The camera moves backward (a \"dolly out\") in a perfectly steady and slow manner. The terms \"smooth\" and \"minor\" are excellent descriptors for the steadiness and scale of the movement.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is mostly complete, but it omits one element from the instructions that could have been included.\n\n**What it covers well:**\n*   **Camera Angle:** \"low angle\" is specified.\n*   **Focus:** \"focuses on a cybernetic figure in the foreground\" and \"shallow depth of field\" perfectly describe the focus plane and depth.\n*   **Movement:** \"smooth, minor backward movement\" effectively covers the type (translation), direction (backward), steadiness (smooth), and speed/scale (minor).\n\n**What could be added for perfect completeness:**\n*   **Purpose of Movement:** The instructions ask for the purpose of the movement if relevant. In this case, the slow backward dolly serves to subtly reveal more of the environment and establish the character within their setting, enhancing their powerful presence. Adding this would make the caption more comprehensive.\n\n**What it correctly omits:**\n*   **Video Speed:** The video is at regular speed, so its omission is correct per the instructions.\n*   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so its omission is correct.\n*   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so its omission is correct.\n*   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so not mentioning a *rack focus* or *focus tracking* is correct.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres very well to the core principles of the instructions.\n\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is an excellent example of conciseness. It avoids jargon where possible (e.g., using \"backward movement\" instead of \"dolly out\") and packs the key information into a single, readable sentence.\n*   **Informative Description:** It successfully describes the video’s and camera’s configuration without being overly technical.\n*   **Omission of Redundant Info:** It correctly follows the rule to not mention regular speed, lack of distortion, or a level horizon.\n\n### Final Verdict and Suggested Improvement\n\nThe caption is excellent and fulfills the request to a high standard. To make it perfect according to the detailed instructions, you could add the purpose of the camera movement.\n\n**Slightly Improved Version (for 100% completeness):**\n\n> Shot from a low angle, the camera focuses on a cybernetic figure in the foreground, utilizing a shallow depth of field. The camera performs a smooth, minor backward movement **to subtly establish the character within her futuristic environment.**",
