    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, level angle, the camera smoothly dollies backward, leading a woman as she jumps from a vehicle. The camera tilts down slightly as she lands and then tilts back up to keep her upper body in frame. The focus begins deep and transitions to a shallow depth of field, keeping the approaching woman sharp while the background blurs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows a woman in white jumping from a helicopter-like object to the ground and walking toward the camera. It starts with deep focus, but as she approaches, it transitions to shallow focus with the foreground in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward, tracking a person exiting a plane. It slightly tilts downward as she jumps and lands, then tilts upward to focus on her upper body as she walks forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great exercise. Here is a detailed evaluation of the provided caption based on the video and your instructions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good but not perfect. It successfully identifies most of the key camera actions and attributes, using correct terminology. However, it contains two notable inaccuracies, one regarding the camera's relationship to the subject and a more significant one concerning the depth of field.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **Strengths:**\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** `From an eye-level, level angle` is perfectly accurate. The camera is positioned at a natural human height and the horizon is not tilted.\n    *   **Camera Movement (Type & Steadiness):** `the camera smoothly dollies backward` is correct. The movement is very steady, and it is a dolly shot (the entire camera is moving), not a zoom.\n    *   **Camera Movement (Rotation):** `The camera tilts down slightly as she lands and then tilts back up to keep her upper body in frame` is an excellent and precise description of the vertical rotation and its purpose.\n\n*   **Areas for Improvement:**\n    *   **Movement Purpose:** The phrase `leading a woman` is slightly inaccurate. \"Leading\" a subject implies the camera is moving ahead of them, showing the space they are about to enter. In this video, the camera is moving backward *with* her, keeping her in the same relative position in the frame. More accurate terms would be **tracking with**, **following**, or **moving alongside** the woman.\n    *   **Focus / Depth of Field:** The description `The focus begins deep and transitions to a shallow depth of field` is incorrect. The shot **begins and ends with a shallow depth of field**. At the start, the background (trees and road) is already softly out of focus. As the woman moves closer to the camera, the background blur becomes more pronounced, which is a natural optical effect of a subject approaching a lens with a wide aperture (shallow DoF). The shot never exhibits \"deep focus,\" where both the foreground and background would be sharp.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is very complete according to the instructions.\n\n*   It correctly omits mentions of **video speed**, **lens distortion**, and **Dutch angle**, as none are present, adhering to the conciseness rule.\n*   It covers all the relevant, observable aspects:\n    *   **Camera Height & Angle:** Covered.\n    *   **Movements:** Covered (dolly, tilt, steadiness, purpose).\n    *   **Focus:** Covered (though inaccurately described).\n\nThe caption successfully isolates and describes the important technical elements of the shot without adding unnecessary information.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to the structural and terminological requirements of the instructions.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a lot of correct information into two sentences.\n*   **Correct Terminology:** It correctly uses terms like `eye-level`, `level angle`, `dolly`, `tilt`, and `depth of field`.\n*   **Temporal Order:** It correctly describes the sequence of events: the dolly, the jump, the tilt down, and the tilt up.\n\nThe primary failure is not in adherence to the *rules* of the instructions, but in the *accuracy* of the information applied.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that corrects the inaccuracies while maintaining the strengths of the original:\n\n**\"From an eye-level, level angle, the camera smoothly dollies backward, tracking alongside a woman as she jumps from a moving vehicle. It tilts down to follow her landing and then tilts back up to keep her in frame. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field throughout, keeping the woman in sharp focus while the background remains blurred, with the blur becoming more pronounced as she moves closer to the camera.\"**",
