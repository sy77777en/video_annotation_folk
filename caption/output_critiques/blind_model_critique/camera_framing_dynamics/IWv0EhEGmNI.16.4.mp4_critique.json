    "pre_caption": "From an eye-level, level angle, the camera smoothly dollies backward, leading a woman as she jumps from a vehicle. The camera tilts down slightly as she lands and then tilts back up to keep her upper body in frame. The focus begins deep and transitions to a shallow depth of field, keeping the approaching woman sharp while the background blurs.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The video shows a woman in white jumping from a helicopter-like object to the ground and walking toward the camera. It starts with deep focus, but as she approaches, it transitions to shallow focus with the foreground in focus.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves backward, tracking a person exiting a plane. It slightly tilts downward as she jumps and lands, then tilts upward to focus on her upper body as she walks forward.\n\n**Subject Tracking:** The camera is leading the subject from the front. During the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is smooth with minimal shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "While the caption accurately identifies the main camera movements and the shift in focus, it lacks specificity and misses several key details that would be prominent in such a dynamic shot. The description of the camera height as \"eye-level\" is likely inaccurate for the entire sequence; while it may start at eye-level with the woman in the vehicle, it would transition to a lower angle to capture her landing, making the impact feel more dramatic. The caption also omits any mention of video speed, whereas a stunt like this would almost certainly be captured in slow-motion to emphasize the athleticism of the jump and the texture of the dust kicking up on landing. The term \"dollies backward\" is functionally correct, but \"tracking backward\" would be more precise, as the camera is following a moving subject. Furthermore, the focus change is described as a single transition from deep to shallow, but it's more likely a continuous focus tracking that actively maintains sharpness on the woman as her distance to the lens changes, creating a sustained shallow depth of field to isolate her from the vehicle she just left. Finally, the caption fails to mention the purpose of the movements: the backward tracking builds tension and momentum, the tilt ensures the action's key moment is captured, and the shallow focus directs the viewer's attention squarely onto the protagonist's determined expression.",
