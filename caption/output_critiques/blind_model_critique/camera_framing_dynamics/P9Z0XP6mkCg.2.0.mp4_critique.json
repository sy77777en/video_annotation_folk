    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at eye level with a level angle, moving forward slowly and smoothly toward a computer monitor. The shot uses a shallow depth of field, keeping the midground—specifically, the computer screen—in focus, while the foreground and background are softly blurred.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving forward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is accurate, complete, and perfectly adheres to the provided instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of why:\n\n### Accuracy\n*   **Camera Position and Angle:** The description of the camera being at \"eye level with a level angle\" is accurate. The camera is not tilted up or down and is positioned at a height typical for someone viewing a monitor.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The phrase \"moving forward slowly and smoothly toward a computer monitor\" correctly identifies the movement's type (translation forward, or a dolly-in), speed (slow), and steadiness (smooth).\n*   **Focus and Depth of Field:** The caption accurately identifies a \"shallow depth of field.\" It correctly specifies that the \"midground—specifically, the computer screen—in focus\" and that the \"foreground and background are softly blurred.\" This precisely matches what is seen in the video.\n\n### Completeness and Adherence to Instructions\n*   **Conciseness:** The caption is concise, packing all the essential information into two clear sentences.\n*   **Omission of Unnecessary Details:** As per the instructions, it correctly omits any mention of **video speed** (which is normal), **lens distortion** (which is absent), and **Dutch angle** (which is not used). This demonstrates a perfect understanding of the \"if present\" and \"if altered\" conditions in the instructions.\n*   **Required Elements:** The caption successfully covers all the relevant configurations present in the video:\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"eye level\"\n    *   **Camera Angle:** \"level angle\"\n    *   **Movements:** \"moving forward slowly and smoothly\" (covering type, speed, and steadiness).\n    *   **Focus:** \"shallow depth of field,\" \"midground... in focus,\" \"foreground and background are softly blurred\" (covering depth, focus plane, and effect).\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the instructions. It is technically precise without being overly jargonistic, provides a complete picture of the shot's technical aspects, and demonstrates excellent judgment by including only the necessary information.",
