    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A slow-motion video with forward playback speed slower than real-time.\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving backward.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video and your detailed instructions, here is a thorough evaluation of the provided caption:\n\n**Caption:** This slow-motion video captures a young man playing the piano from an eye-level, level angle. The camera maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire scene sharp as it smoothly and slowly dollies backward, moving away from the musician.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **excellent**. It is highly accurate, complete according to the instructions, and perfectly adheres to the specified format and level of detail. It successfully balances technical terminology with clear, descriptive language.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Feedback:**\n\n#### **1. Accuracy: Perfect**\n\nEvery technical detail mentioned in the caption is a correct description of the video.\n\n*   **Video Speed:** The caption correctly identifies the video as **\"slow-motion.\"** The musician's hand movements and the overall feel of the shot are clearly slower than real-time.\n*   **Camera Angle & Height:** The description of **\"eye-level, level angle\"** is accurate. The camera is positioned straight-on, not looking up or down at the subject, and is at a height comparable to the subject's head.\n*   **Focus:** The caption correctly states the camera maintains a **\"deep focus,\"** and the explanation **\"keeping the entire scene sharp\"** is a perfect, user-friendly clarification. Both the foreground (piano, musician) and the background (wall, lamp) remain in focus throughout the shot.\n*   **Camera Movement:** The description of the movement as a smooth, slow **\"dolly backward\"** is precise. The camera moves physically away from the subject in a straight line, and the quality of the movement is both smooth and slow.\n\n#### **2. Completeness: Excellent**\n\nThe caption includes all the necessary information required by the instructions while correctly omitting irrelevant details.\n\n*   **Covered Elements:** It successfully addresses video speed, camera angle, camera height, camera movement (type, steadiness, speed), and focus (depth).\n*   **Omitted Elements (Correctly):**\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable lens distortion, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Dutch Angle:** The horizon is level, so there was no need to mention a Dutch angle.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to describe a rack focus or focus tracking.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so no transitions needed to be described.\n\nThe caption demonstrates a strong understanding of the instruction to be concise by not mentioning the absence of these features.\n\n#### **3. Adherence to Instructions: Perfect**\n\nThe caption follows the spirit and letter of the instructions flawlessly.\n\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs all the required information into a single, well-structured sentence without being verbose.\n*   **Use of Terminology:** It uses the correct technical terms as requested (e.g., `slow-motion`, `eye-level`, `level angle`, `deep focus`, `dollies backward`).\n*   **Clarity:** It enhances technical terms with simple explanations (e.g., \"dollies backward, moving away from the musician\"), making the description accessible even to those unfamiliar with the jargon.\n*   **Structure:** The description flows logically from the general shot characteristics to the specific camera parameters and movement, creating a clear and easy-to-read summary.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis caption is an ideal example of what the instructions asked for. It is a model of accuracy, conciseness, and adherence to a complex set of rules. No improvements are necessary.",
