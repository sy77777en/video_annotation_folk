    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at an aerial level with a high angle, looking down from above. It uses deep focus with a large depth of field. The camera moves smoothly and swiftly downward, centering on a person standing near a hole, while rolling clockwise. The movement is very smooth with no shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an aerial level.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera moves smoothly and swiftly downward, centering the subject while rolling clockwise.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great video for testing the captioning instructions. Here is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is good and captures the general essence of the shot. However, it lacks the precision and completeness required by the detailed instructions, particularly concerning the description of camera movement and the evolution of the camera angle.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Accurate:**\n    *   **Camera Height:** \"aerial level\" is correct for the starting position.\n    *   **Focus:** \"deep focus with a large depth of field\" is perfectly accurate. The entire scene, from the subject to the distant trees, remains sharp.\n    *   **Movement Direction/Rotation:** \"moves... downward\" and \"rolling clockwise\" are both correct.\n    *   **Steadiness:** \"The movement is very smooth with no shaking\" is accurate, as the shot is perfectly stabilized.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Imprecise:**\n    *   **Camera Angle:** The caption states a \"high angle.\" While this is true for the end of the shot, it's imprecise. The shot **begins** with a **bird's-eye angle** (looking straight down) and **transitions** into a high angle as it gets closer to the subject. The instructions specifically ask to note such shifts.\n    *   **Camera Movement:** The description \"moves... downward\" is incomplete. The camera is not just moving straight down (a pedestal or crane down). It is also moving **forward** (a dolly in). This combination of craning down and dollying in is what creates the \"spiraling\" effect. Omitting the forward dolly movement misses a critical component of the shot's dynamic.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing:**\n    *   **Forward Movement:** As mentioned above, the caption fails to describe the **dolly forward** movement. The instructions explicitly list \"dollying (moving forward/backward)\" as a key movement to identify.\n    *   **Angle Transition:** The caption doesn't describe the change in camera angle from bird's-eye to high angle.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** The video clearly shows **mild barrel distortion**, which is common with wide-angle drone lenses. Straight lines (like the horizon or tree lines) appear slightly curved, especially near the edges of the frame as the camera descends. The instructions ask to describe this if present.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   **Where it Adheres:**\n    *   It is concise.\n    *   It correctly identifies and uses terms like \"deep focus\" and \"rolling.\"\n    *   It correctly omits mentions of video speed and Dutch angle, as they are not relevant.\n    *   It describes the steadiness of the shot.\n\n*   **Where it Falls Short:**\n    *   It fails to use the specific terminology for translational movements (`dolly`, `crane`) as requested. It uses the general term \"downward\" instead of the more precise \"cranes down\" or \"pedestals down.\"\n    *   It fails to describe the complexity and combination of movements (craning + dollying + rolling).\n    *   It fails to note the shift in camera angle during the movement.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**The shot begins at an aerial level with a bird's-eye angle, exhibiting mild barrel distortion. The camera executes a smooth, swift, and complex movement: it simultaneously cranes down and dollies forward while rolling clockwise to center on a person below. During this movement, the camera angle transitions from a bird's-eye to a high angle. The shot maintains a deep focus, keeping the entire landscape sharp throughout.**",
