    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is underwater.\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead). The camera is also at a dutch angle that varies due to camera rolling.\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera, representing an FPV perspective, slowly moves forward while panning left to explore the underwater environment.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Yes, the caption is excellent for this video. It is highly accurate, complete, and adheres perfectly to the detailed instructions provided.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why:\n\n### 1. Accuracy\nThe caption correctly identifies and describes every key aspect of the video and camera configuration:\n*   **Perspective and Feel:** \"smooth, underwater, first-person perspective\" is a perfect summary of the shot's overall feel and setting. The movement is indeed very smooth.\n*   **Movement:** \"moves slowly forward and pans left\" accurately describes the primary camera movements (a dolly forward and a pan left). \"to explore the environment\" correctly identifies the purpose of the movement.\n*   **Angle and Rotation:** \"maintains a level angle but rolls, creating a varying Dutch angle\" is a sophisticated and precise observation. The camera does not tilt up or down, but its roll on the z-axis is a dominant feature, and correctly identifying this as creating a \"varying Dutch angle\" is spot-on.\n*   **Focus:** \"A deep focus keeps the entire scene sharp\" is accurate. Both the foreground rocks and the background water are in clear focus, indicating a deep depth of field.\n\n### 2. Completeness\nThe caption successfully includes all the relevant information requested by the instructions while correctly omitting what isn't necessary:\n*   **Included:** It covers camera height (`underwater`), angle (`level angle`), movements (`moves forward`, `pans left`, `rolls`), steadiness (`smooth`), speed (`slowly`), purpose (`to explore`), and focus (`deep focus`). It also correctly identifies the presence of a `Dutch angle`.\n*   **Correctly Omitted:**\n    *   **Video Speed:** By not mentioning it, the caption correctly implies the video is at regular speed.\n    *   **Lens Distortion:** There is no noticeable distortion, so it was correctly left out.\n    *   **Shot Transitions:** The video is a single, continuous shot, so there are no transitions to describe.\n    *   **Focus Changes:** The focus is static, so there was no need to mention rack focus or tracking.\n\n### 3. Adherence to Instructions\nThe caption follows the formatting and stylistic rules perfectly:\n*   **Concise yet Informative:** It packs a large amount of technical detail into a single, readable sentence without being overly verbose.\n*   **Uses Correct Terminology:** It effectively uses terms from the instructions like `level angle`, `rolls`, `Dutch angle`, and `deep focus`.\n*   **Describes Compound Movements:** It clearly explains the multiple simultaneous movements (forward dolly, left pan, and roll) in a logical way.\n\nIn summary, the caption is a model example of how to follow the given instructions. It is technically precise, comprehensive in its coverage of relevant details, and written in a clear and concise manner.",
  "revised_caption_by_generated_critique": "From a smooth, underwater, first-person perspective, the camera glides forward and gently pans left to explore the environment. It maintains a level angle while rolling, creating a dynamic Dutch angle. A deep focus ensures the entire scene remains sharp and clear.",
