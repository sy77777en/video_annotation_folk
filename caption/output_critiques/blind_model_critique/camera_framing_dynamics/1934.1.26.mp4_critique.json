    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera is completely static, with no movement or shaking.",

  "generated_critique": "Based on the video provided, here is a detailed evaluation of the caption.\n\n**Caption:** The video features a static camera positioned at eye level with a level angle. It employs deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field throughout.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe caption is **not good** because it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera angle and depth of field, which are two of the most prominent visual characteristics of the shot.\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **\"static camera\"**: **Accurate.** The camera remains completely still throughout the video.\n*   **\"positioned at eye level\"**: **Misleading.** While the camera might be physically placed at the eye level of a seated person, this term usually implies a straight-on perspective. The shot's defining feature is its downward-looking angle, making this description imprecise.\n*   **\"with a level angle\"**: **Inaccurate.** The camera is clearly tilted downwards to look at the keyboard. This is a **high-angle** shot, not a level one.\n*   **\"employs deep focus, maintaining a large depth of field\"**: **Highly Inaccurate.** The video clearly demonstrates a **shallow depth of field**. The focus is selectively set on the hands and the keyboard (the midground), while the top of the laptop screen (background) and the front edge of the desk (foreground) are noticeably out of focus and blurred. Deep focus would render the entire scene from front to back in sharp detail.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption fails to describe the most important stylistic choices of the shot. By misidentifying the angle and focus, it omits the correct and essential information: that this is a **high-angle** shot with a **shallow depth of field**. It correctly follows the instruction to omit standard features like normal video speed and lack of distortion.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nWhile the caption attempts to use the specified terminology and is concise, its failure to provide an accurate description means it does not fulfill the primary instruction: to create an \"informative description of the video’s and camera’s configuration.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe caption is poor because it misrepresents the visual composition of the video. The use of a high angle and shallow depth of field are deliberate choices that define the shot's look and feel, and the caption incorrectly describes both.\n\n---\n\n### Example of a Good Caption:\n\nHere is a revised caption that accurately follows the instructions:\n\n**\"This is a static, high-angle shot focused on a person's hands typing. The camera employs a shallow depth of field, keeping the keyboard in the midground sharp while the foreground and background are softly blurred.\"**",
