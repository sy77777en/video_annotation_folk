    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, steadiness, intensity, complexity), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, or *speed ramp* (a mix of fast and slow speeds). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, ground-level, overhead-level, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial, overly blurry, or lacking in cinematic focus effects.  \n\nIf the **camera is static**, no further description is needed. If it moves, describe its **type, direction, and speed**. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing (circling around), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), panning (rotating horizontally), tilting (angling vertically), pedestaling (lifting/lowering), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If motion intensity varies, distinguish between slow and rapid movements and present them in **temporal order** (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If motion appears **fragmented or random**, summarize it concisely rather than over-describing each small movement (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*).\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** A regular-speed video where events play in real-time without acceleration or slowing. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a deep focus with a large depth of field.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows a clear movement pattern. The camera is moving left.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent. This is a great opportunity to analyze the nuances of the instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the provided caption based on its accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It is accurate in all its claims and follows the instruction for conciseness by omitting unnecessary information. However, it could be improved by using more specific technical terminology provided in the instructions and by being slightly more descriptive about the movement.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\nThe caption is **highly accurate**. Every statement it makes correctly describes an aspect of the video.\n\n*   **\"camera at eye level with a level angle\"**: **Correct.** The camera is positioned at a height and angle that mimics a person standing and looking straight ahead.\n*   **\"utilizing deep focus for a large depth of field\"**: **Correct.** The foreground (road), midground (intersection, cars), and background (distant buildings) are all in sharp focus. The phrase is slightly redundant, as \"deep focus\" implies a large depth of field, but it is not factually incorrect.\n*   **\"The camera moves smoothly to the left\"**: **Correct.** The camera's movement is fluid and in a leftward direction.\n*   **\"without any shaking\"**: **Correct.** The shot is perfectly stable, likely achieved with a gimbal, dolly, or vehicle mount.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\nThe caption is **mostly complete** but misses a few key details that would make it more informative.\n\n*   **What it covers well:** It successfully identifies the camera's height, angle, focus, and steadiness.\n*   **What's missing or could be more specific:**\n    *   **Type of Movement:** The instruction provides specific terms like `trucking` (moving left/right). The caption uses the general term \"moves to the left.\" Using \"trucks left\" would be more precise and demonstrate a better understanding of the requested terminology.\n    *   **Speed of Movement:** The instruction asks to describe the speed of movement. The caption notes it is \"smoothly\" done, but doesn't mention that it moves at a **constant, moderate speed**.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement:** While not always necessary, the movement here has a clear purpose: to reveal more of the street scene to the left. This could be briefly mentioned for a more comprehensive description.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\nThe caption adheres well to some instructions but falls short on others.\n\n*   **Strengths (Excellent Adherence):**\n    *   **Conciseness:** The caption excels at being concise. It correctly follows the rule: *\"if the video is at regular playback speed, has no lens distortion, and no Dutch angle, there is no need to mention these.\"* By omitting these points, it avoids clutter.\n*   **Areas for Improvement (Partial Adherence):**\n    *   **Technical Terminology:** The instructions explicitly ask for descriptions of movements like `trucking`. The caption's use of the generic \"moves\" instead of the specific \"trucks\" is its main weakness in adhering to the detailed instructions.\n    *   **Redundancy:** The phrase \"deep focus for a large depth of field\" could be shortened to just \"deep focus\" to be even more concise, as the instruction values brevity.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a revised caption that incorporates the feedback and adheres more closely to all instructions:\n\n**\"Shot from an eye-level, level angle with deep focus, the camera smoothly trucks left at a constant speed to reveal the street scene.\"**\n\n**Why this version is better:**\n\n*   **Uses Technical Terminology:** Replaces \"moves to the left\" with the more precise term **\"trucks left\"**.\n*   **More Descriptive:** Adds that the speed is **\"constant\"**.\n*   **More Concise:** It integrates the camera's starting configuration into the main sentence for better flow.\n*   **Adds Purpose (Optional but good):** Briefly mentions the purpose (\"to reveal the street scene\"), adding valuable context.",
