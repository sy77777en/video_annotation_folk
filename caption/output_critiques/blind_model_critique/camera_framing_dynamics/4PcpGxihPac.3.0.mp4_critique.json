    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a level angle (looking straight ahead).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the midground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The camera shows some minor movement. The camera is moving forward and panning left to right.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is very smooth with no shaking. \n\n**Camera Motion Speed**: The camera is moving slowly.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "No, the caption is not good because it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the camera's movement. While it correctly identifies some elements, its core description of the motion is wrong.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the instructions:\n\n### Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **Speed and Steadiness:** The shot is indeed **slow** and **smooth**.\n    *   **Camera Height:** The camera is at **eye-level**.\n    *   **Focus:** It correctly identifies a **shallow depth of field** and that the **man in the driver's seat** in the **midground** is the plane of focus.\n\n*   **What's Incorrect:**\n    *   **Movement (Translation):** The caption states the camera \"moves forward.\" This is inaccurate. The camera moves sideways from left to right, parallel to the front of the car. The correct term for this is **trucking right**. It does not dolly forward toward the subject.\n    *   **Movement (Rotation):** The caption claims the camera is \"panning from left to right.\" This is the most critical error. To keep the driver in the frame while the camera body trucks to the right, the camera must rotate its lens toward the left. Therefore, it is **panning left**. A pan right would have moved the camera's view away from the driver.\n    *   **Combined Movement:** The combination of \"moves forward while panning from left to right\" is a completely different motion than what is shown. The actual movement is a **truck right while panning left**, which can be more concisely described as **arcing counter-clockwise** around the subject.\n\n### Completeness\n\nThe caption is missing several key details requested by the instructions:\n\n*   **Camera Angle:** It mentions camera height (`eye-level`) but omits the camera angle, which is a **level angle**.\n*   **Precise Terminology:** It uses generic terms (\"moves forward\") instead of the specific technical terms requested by the instructions (\"trucking,\" \"arcing\").\n*   **Movement Purpose:** While not strictly required, a complete description could mention the purpose of the movement, which is to smoothly reveal the driver inside the car.\n\n### Adherence to the Instruction\n\n*   The caption successfully follows the instruction to be **concise** and to omit unnecessary information (like regular video speed and lack of lens distortion).\n*   However, it fails to provide an **informative description of the camera's configuration and movements** due to the major inaccuracies. It misidentifies both the translational and rotational movements, which is the most complex aspect of the shot.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Caption Example\n\nHere is a caption that accurately follows the instructions:\n\n**This slow, steady, eye-level shot trucks right while panning left to keep the driver in frame, creating a smooth counter-clockwise arc around the front of the car. It maintains a level angle and uses a shallow depth of field, holding sharp focus on the man in the midground while blurring the foreground and background.**",
