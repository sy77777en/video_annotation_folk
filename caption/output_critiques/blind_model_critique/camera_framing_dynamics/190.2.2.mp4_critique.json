    "pre_caption": "The camera is positioned at a slightly high angle, looking down at the rear right of the car. It uses a shallow depth of field, focusing on the car in the foreground. The handheld camera moves forward, panning slightly left to keep the person inside the vehicle in focus, with some unsteady shaking.",
    "pre_caption_prompt": "Provide a concise yet informative description of the **video’s and camera’s configuration**, covering **video speed, lens distortion, camera angle, camera height, movements (translation, rotation, zooming, steadiness, arcing, craning, tracking, speed, complexity, and purpose), and focus (depth, focus plane, focus changes).**  \n\nIf **video speed** is altered, specify the type, such as *time-lapse* (“Clouds move rapidly across the sky”), *slow-motion*, *fast-motion*, or *speed ramp* (changing between fast and slow motion). If the video is *time-reversed* or *stop-motion*, note this as well.  \n\nIf **lens distortion** is present, describe the type and degree. For example, *fisheye distortion* creates extreme curvature, while *barrel distortion* causes mild outward bowing of straight lines near the edges.  \n\nDescribe the **camera height** in relation to the ground, such as *eye-level, hip-level, ground-level, overhead-level, aerial-level, above water, or underwater*. If height changes due to movement, mention how it transitions. Similarly, specify the **camera angle**, such as *bird’s eye, high angle, level angle, low angle, or worm’s eye*, noting any shifts within the video. If a **Dutch angle** (tilted horizon) is present, indicate whether it remains fixed or varies due to camera rolling.  \n\nIf discernible, describe the **camera focus and depth of field**. For example, *deep focus* keeps all elements sharp, while *shallow or ultra-shallow depth of field* blurs the background or foreground. If focus changes dynamically, note whether it’s a *rack focus* (shifting focus between subjects) or *focus tracking* (following a subject’s depth movement), and state the focus plane at each stage (foreground, midground, background, or out-of-focus). If the video lacks realistic depth of field, describe whether it appears artificial (without a physical camera) or overly blurry.\n\nIf the **camera is static**, simply state that the shot is static. If it moves, describe the **type, direction, steadiness, and speed** of movement. Specify movements such as *tracking (following a subject), arcing clockwise/counterclockwise (circling around a subject or frame center horizontally), craning up/down (circling around a subject or frame center vertically), zooming (changing focal length), dollying (moving forward/backward), trucking (moving left/right), pedestaling (moving up/down), panning (rotating the camera horizontally), tilting (rotating the camera up/down), or rolling (rotating around the lens axis).* If the camera is shaking or wobbling, indicate the degree (e.g., minimal, moderate, or severe). If different movements occur at different speeds, clearly distinguish them. If the camera performs multiple movements, describe them in temporal order (e.g., *“The camera first pans right, then tilts upward to follow the subject”*). If movement is fragmented or random, summarize it concisely instead of detailing every small change (e.g., *“The first-person camera moves erratically, frequently changing direction without a clear pattern”*). If relevant, describe the reason or purpose of the camera movement.\n\nCrucially, instead of inferring these attributes from the video, we have already provided human-labeled ground truth for some of the elements specified above. You should directly use this information in your description and should not infer any details that are not already provided. Your description should be brief, and if anything is normal or unremarkable, you do not need to include it (e.g., if the video is at regular playback speed, there is no need to mention it).\n\n**Playback Speed:** The playback is forward at real-time speed without noticeable speed-up or slowdown. (no need to mention).\n\n**Lens Distortion:** No lens distortion (no need to mention).\n\n**Camera Height:** The camera is at an eye level (above the waist).\n\n**Camera Angle:** The camera angle is at a high angle (looking down from above).\n\n**Camera Focus:** The camera uses a shallow depth of field, keeping a limited range in focus. The camera is focused on the foreground.\n\n**Camera Motion:** The handheld camera looks down at a car from behind and to the right. It slowly moves closer, slightly panning left to keep focus on the person inside the vehicle.\n\n**Camera Steadiness:** The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.\n\nIf possible, specify the subject that the camera focuses on when describing camera work. For instance, use 'focus on the man in the foreground' rather than 'focus on the foreground.' Likewise, if the camera follows a subject, avoid the generic phrase 'tracking the subject(s).' Instead, identify the subject and describe the specific type of tracking.",

  "generated_critique": "Excellent analysis. The provided caption is a good starting point, but it has some minor inaccuracies and omissions when measured against the detailed instructions.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the caption's performance:\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe caption is **good but not perfect**. It correctly identifies the most prominent visual characteristics of the shot (high angle, shallow depth of field, handheld movement). However, it could be more precise with its terminology and more complete in its description, according to the specific rules provided.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Feedback\n\n#### 1. Accuracy\n\n*   **What's Correct:**\n    *   **\"a slightly high angle, looking down\"**: This is accurate. The camera is positioned higher than the subject, creating a high-angle perspective.\n    *   **\"shallow depth of field\"**: This is perfectly accurate. The background is clearly blurred, isolating the subject.\n    *   **\"handheld camera\"** and **\"unsteady shaking\"**: This is correct. The movement has the organic, slightly shaky quality of a handheld shot.\n\n*   **What's Inaccurate or Misleading:**\n    *   **\"focusing on the car in the foreground\"**: The car and the person are the main subjects, which are technically in the **midground**. The foreground is the space closest to the camera, which is empty.\n    *   **\"panning slightly left to keep the person... in focus\"**: This is a conceptual error. **Panning** is a rotational movement used to keep the subject **in the frame**. **Focusing** is the adjustment of the lens to keep the subject **sharp**. The caption incorrectly attributes the act of focusing to the panning motion. The camera is likely using autofocus or a manual focus pull to *track focus* on the person, which is a separate action from panning.\n\n#### 2. Completeness\n\n*   **What's Missing (based on the instructions):**\n    *   **Camera Height**: The caption mentions the angle but omits the height (e.g., **eye-level** or **shoulder-level**).\n    *   **Movement Terminology**: While \"moves forward\" is correct, a more precise term from the instructions would be **\"dollying forward\"** or, more appropriately since it's following a subject, **\"tracking\"**. The combination of moving forward and panning to follow a subject is best described as tracking.\n    *   **Focus Details**: The caption correctly identifies a shallow DoF but misses the dynamic aspect of the focus. The instructions ask to note **\"focus tracking\"** if the camera follows a subject's movement in depth, which is happening here.\n    *   **Purpose of Movement**: The caption attempts to state the purpose but does so inaccurately (as noted above). A clearer, more accurate statement would be that the camera moves to follow the subject.\n\n#### 3. Adherence to Instructions\n\n*   The caption successfully adheres to the instruction to be **concise**.\n*   It correctly omits details that are not present (e.g., video speed alterations, lens distortion, Dutch angle).\n*   However, it fails to incorporate several specific terms and concepts requested in the instructions, such as **camera height**, **focus tracking**, and more precise movement descriptions like **tracking**.\n\n---\n\n### Revised and Improved Caption\n\nHere is a revised caption that more accurately and completely follows the instructions:\n\n**\"From an eye-level, high angle, the shot uses a shallow depth of field with the focus tracking a person in the midground. The unsteady, handheld camera tracks forward and pans left to follow the person as they walk to the driver's side door of a car.\"**\n\n### Why the Revised Caption is Better:\n\n*   **Specifies Height and Angle:** \"eye-level, high angle\" is more complete.\n*   **Corrects Focus Description:** It correctly identifies **\"focus tracking\"** and places the subject in the **\"midground.\"**\n*   **Uses Precise Movement Terminology:** **\"Tracks forward and pans left\"** is a more technical and accurate description of the compound movement used to follow the subject.\n*   **Clarifies Purpose:** The phrase \"to follow the person\" clearly and accurately states the purpose of the camera's movement.\n*   **Maintains Conciseness:** It conveys more information without being overly long.",
